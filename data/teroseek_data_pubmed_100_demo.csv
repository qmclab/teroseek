0,TA038182,10.1186/1471-2164-10-465,Global characterization of Artemisia annua glandular trichome transcriptome using454 pyrosequencing.,"BACKGROUND: Glandular trichomes produce a wide variety of commercially importantsecondary metabolites in many plant species. The most prominent anti-malarialdrug artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone, is produced in glandular trichomes ofArtemisia annua. However, only limited genomic information is currently availablein this non-model plant species. RESULTS: We present a global characterization ofA. annua glandular trichome transcriptome using 454 pyrosequencing. Sequencingruns using two normalized cDNA collections from glandular trichomes yielded406,044 expressed sequence tags (average length = 210 nucleotides), whichassembled into 42,678 contigs and 147,699 singletons. Performing a secondsequencing run only increased the number of genes identified by approximately30%, indicating that massively parallel pyrosequencing provides deep coverage ofthe A. annua trichome transcriptome. By BLAST search against the NCBInon-redundant protein database, putative functions were assigned to over 28,573unigenes, including previously undescribed enzymes likely involved insesquiterpene biosynthesis. Comparison with ESTs derived from trichomecollections of other plant species revealed expressed genes in common functionalcategories across different plant species. RT-PCR analysis confirmed theexpression of selected unigenes and novel transcripts in A. annua glandulartrichomes. CONCLUSION: The presence of contigs corresponding to enzymes forterpenoids and flavonoids biosynthesis suggests important metabolic activity inA. annua glandular trichomes. Our comprehensive survey of genes expressed inglandular trichome will facilitate new gene discovery and shed light on theregulatory mechanism of artemisinin metabolism and trichome function in A. annua.","Wang, Wei, Wang, Yejun, Zhang, Qing, Qi, Yan, Guo, Dianjing",2009,BMC genomics,2,False,False,True,"Secreting glandular trichomes (GTs) are a major site for biosynthesis and accumulation of a wide range of plant natural products. These plant natural products often function to protect the plants against insect predation, and contribute to the flavour and aroma of plants. Many of the natural products also have pharmacological effects, such as the analgesic drug morphine, the anticancer compound taxol, and the antimalarial drug artemisinin. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone, is currently recognized as one of the most prominent anti-malarial treatment. A complete understanding of the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway and its regulatory mechanism holds the key to efficient metabolic engineering for increased artemisinin yield. In the past decades, research efforts have been dedicated to identification of enzymes and intermediate compounds leading to artemisinin production. Many genes encoding enzymes participate in the pathway have been cloned and functionally characterized. However, little is known about the regulatory aspects of sesquiterpene metabolism. This is partly due to the fact that A. annua is a non-model plant with limited genomic information available, and sequencing of limited number of randomly selected cDNA clones often have insufficient coverage of less abundant transcripts, including important regulatory transcription factors (TFs). In addition, genes uniquely or preferentially expressed in trichomes may be under-represented in non-tissue-targeted EST sequencing projects. A comprehensive survey of genes expressed in glandular trichome will facilitate new gene discovery and contribute significantly to elucidating the terpenoid pathway regulation and trichome function in A. annua.Whole genome or transcriptome sequencing enables functional genomic studies based on global gene expression. The newly developed high throughput pyrosequencing technology allows rapid production of sequence data with dramatically reduced time, labor, and cost. So far, most applications of pyrosequencing have involved analysis of genomic DNA. Published reports on 454 pyrosequencing of transcriptomes have been mostly restricted to model species with genomic or comprehensive Sanger EST data available. Previous studies using genome or Sanger EST sequences for mapping and annotation of 454 ESTs were not able to accomplish de novo assembly of their 454 ESTs. We here present the global transcriptome characterization of A. annua glandular trichome, the so called biofactory for the production of artemisinin and other plant secondary metabolites. We assigned putative function to 28,573 unigenes, including previously undescribed enzymes likely involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. We verified the expression of 32 selected unigenes and novel transcripts in glandular trichomes using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. These 454 ESTs were linked to metabolic process specific in glandular trichomes and form the basis for further investigation.","A. annua seeds were purchased from Youyang, Sichuang province of China. Seeds were sown into commercial potting mixture for germination. The germinated plantlets were grown under natural light conditions in the greenhouse located at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Flower buds were collected for trichome isolation before flowering.Trichome cells were gently abraded from the surface of flower buds using glass beads and a commercial cell disrupter (BioSpec Products). The isolated secretary cells were separated from other cells and tissue fragments in the mixture by sequentially passing through a 40 μm and a 30 μm nylon sieves. Glandular cells were finally collected in 30 μm meshes with minimum contamination of non-glandular trichomes (Figure 5).Total RNA was extracted from glandular trichomes isolated from 30 g flower buds following the standard protocol of RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using the BD SMARTM PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with oligo(dT) primer as described in the provided protocol using 500 ng total RNA. Double-strand cDNA was prepared from 2 μl of the first-strand reaction by PCR with provided primers in a 100 μL reaction. cDNA was purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification spin columns. Normalization was performed using TRIMMER cDNA normalization kit (EVR_GEN) to decrease the prevalence of abundant transcripts before sequencing. Approximately 1 μg of normalized double stranded cDNA was used for 454 pyrosequencing.Approximately 1 μg of the adaptor-ligated cDNA population was sheared by nebulization and DNA sequencing was performed following protocols for the Genome Sequencer GS FLX System (Roche Diagnostic). Reads generated by the FLX sequencer were trimmed of low quality, low complexity [poly(A)] and adaptor sequences using the SeqClean software . The cleaned sequences were subject to CAP3 program for clustering and assembly using default parameters.After assembly, the resulting contigs and singlets were aligned with NCBI non-redundant protein database using blast2go software with a cut-off e-value of 1e-10. The GI accessions of best hits were retrieved, and the GO accessions were mapped to GO terms according to molecular function, biological process and cellular component ontologies http://www.geneontology.org/.To verify the presence of pyrosequencing ESTs in glandular trichomes, we totally selected 35 unigenes and novel transcripts for RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA were extracted from glandular trichomes, non-glandular hairy trichomes, leaves and hairy roots respectively. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 10 μL (about 1 μg) total RNA using SuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with Oligo(dT)12-18 Primer. PCR was performed using 0.5 to 2 μL of the cDNA in a total of 50 μL reaction volume. The PCR conditions were 2 min at 95°C, 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 47-56°C, 1 min at 72°C for 30 cycles, followed by 5 min at 72°C. These conditions were chosen because none of the samples analyzed reached a plateau at the end of the amplification (i.e. they were at the exponential phase of the amplification). Actin was used as a loading control, and loading was estimated by staining the gel with ethidium bromide. Expression analysis of each gene was confirmed in at least 2 independent RT-reactions using forward and reverse primers.","Totally 406,044 ESTs (minimal size > 50 bp) averaging 210 bp were generated from two consecutive pyrosequencing runs. Cleaning (removal of primer, polyA tail, etc.) of the raw sequences resulted in a total of 386,881 high quality reads with an average length of 205 nucleotides totalling 85 Mb. After clustering and assembly using TGICL CAP3 clustering tools, these reads were assembled into 42,678 contigs and 147,699 singletons. The average length for contigs and singletons are 334 bp and 191 bp respectively. The contigs and singletons are collectively referred to as unigenes. The length distribution of unigenes and their component reads are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.The contigs were searched against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein database using the blastx algorithm. Among the 190,377 contigs and singletons, 29,577(15.5%) had at least one significant alignment to existing gene model in blastx searches (E-value cutoff, e-10) (see Additional file 1). A majority (84.5%) of the pyrosequencing assemblies did not match any known sequences in the existing database and thus likely represent novel (E-value cutoff, pts sion of 17 transcripts identified in this study. Performing a second sequencing run increased the number of genes identified by approximately 30% (Table 3), suggesting that two pyrosequencing runs detect a substantial fraction of genes expressed in glandular trichomes and provide deep coverage of the A. annua trichome transcriptome.The 357,843 sequences that had matches with protein sequences in the NCBI protein database  could be condensed into 29,577 clusters based on their top protein hits. Each 454 contig was assigned a putative gene description and a GO classification based on the 'best hit' blastx search (bitscore > 45, e-value < 1-10), using the 'inferred from sequence similarity' (ISS) level of evidence. The unigenes were classified into three major functional categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, according to the standard Gene Ontology terms (GO; ). The assigned functionality of genes covers a broad range of GO categories. The top 20 most highly represented GO categories are illustrated in Figure 1. Under the category of biological process, transport, transcriptional control, and metabolic process were among the most highly represented categories, indicating the important metabolic activities in A. annua glandular trichomes. Other categories include photosynthesis, secondary metabolism (lignin, flavonoid, and isoprenoid biosynthesis process) and primary metabolism (fatty acid, glycolysis, carbohydrateprocess etc.).TrichOME  is a publicly available database of genes and metabolites expressed in plant trichomes. It currently contains 37, 017 conventional ESTs derived from 8 plant species, including Medicago sativa, Humulus lupulus, Mentha × piperita, Nicotiana benthamiana, Ocimum basilicum, Solanum habrochaites, Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum pennellii. A tblastx search against TrichomeDB showed that only 17,372(9%) of our 454 contigs had best blast hits (e-value < 1e-10) to 8,095 EST clusters with unique descriptions. Thus 454 sequencing has revealed many transcripts not previously detected in A. annua. ESTs homologous to photosynthesis-related proteins (chlorophyll a/b binding protein, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit) are among the top 10 most highly expressed transcripts. The top ranked common molecular function of ESTs identified from all 9 plant species are listed in Table 4. Regulation of metabolic process, metabolic process, oxidation reduction, and transport categories has the highest number of contigs. Trichomes are known to be active in photosynthesis, as well as for their roles in storage and secretion of toxic compounds e.g. heavy metals, which requires the function of transporters. In our assembled pyrosequencing EST collections, we identified a large number of contigs homologous to ABC transporter, which is one of the most important families of membrane transport proteins that may play critical roles in the transmembrane transport of secondary metabolites in plants. The large amount of transporters can be linked to the secretion and transport function of glandular trichomes.Numerous sesquiterpene and monoterpene compounds have been identified in A. annua leaves, stems and isolated glandular trichomes. The genes corresponding to enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of major sesquiterpenes have been cloned and characterized. To investigate the trichome function in secondary metabolism, the annotated unigenes were searched for enzymes participate in terpenoids biosynthesis. As shown in Additional file 2, unigenes corresponding to all the known enzymes in the terpenoids MEP and MVA pathway were identified. In higher plants, terpenoids precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) can be produced from both MVA and MEP routes, which is then converted to its isomer DMAPP (Figure 2). The cytosolic MVA terpenoids pathway, which starts from acetyl-CoA and proceeds through the intermediate mevalonate (MVA), provides the precursors for sterols and ubiquinone. The plastidial MEP pathway, which involves a condensation of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, is used for the synthesis of isoprene, carotenoids, abscisic acid, and the side chains of chlorophylls and plastoquinone. Although the subcellular compartmentation allows both pathways to operate independently, there is ample evidence that cross-talk exist between these two pathways.Unigenes encoding the MEP and MVA pathway enzymes and all the sesquiterpene artemisinin pathway enzymes were present in our pyrosequencing collection. It is noteworthy that although the sequences were derived from normalized cDNA collections, unigenes corresponding to MEP pathway enzymes were two fold more abundant as compared with MVA pathway transcripts. This likely suggests that the MEP pathway may serve as a major route for DMAPP/IPP production in the A. annua trichomes. The MEP pathway has previously been shown to provide precursors for both mono-and sesqui-terpene biosynthesis in snapdragon flowers. In a recent report on hops, the ESTs encoding MEP pathway enzymes are also found more abundant than those of MVA pathways.Except for those well characterized terpenoid pathway genes, other unigenes annotated as sesquiterpene synthase and monoterpene synthase were identified. Three unigenes (Contig02039, Contig16267, Contig14765) annotated as sesquiterpine synthases were selected for RACE PCR to retrieve the full length cDNAs. Sequence analysis indicated that the conserved sesquiterpene synthase functional domain exists in all three genes (Figure 3). Further functional characterization of these enzymes will be reported elsewhere.Furthermore, large amount of unigenes annotated as phenylpropanoids and flavanoids pathway enzymes were present in the assemebled pyrosequencing EST collection (ss Additional file 3), indicating the metabolic function of glandular trichomes in A. annua secondary metabolism.A set of 17 contigs were selected for semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis to confirm their expression (Figure 4A). The selected contigs encode enzymes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis, and putativetranscription factors. PCR experiments were conducted on four pools of cDNAs derived from (1) glandular trichomes, (2) non-glandular trichomes (3) leaves, and (4) roots. The results demonstrate that all of the novel transcripts detected among the 454-ESTs are indeed expressed in glandular trichomes, including those with low expression levels. This suggests that deep pyrosequencing is effective in revealing the expression of many rare transcripts, e.g. transcription factors. Most of the tested contigs were also expressed in leaf and non glandular trichome cDNA pools, except for one contig40477, which was only expressed in glandular trichomes and roots. Interestingly, three contigs likely encode enzymes needed in sesquiterpene biosynthesis were also strongly expressed in non-glandular type of trichomes. This raises the question as to whether glandular trichome is the sole site for the biosynthesis of artemisinin and other sesquiterpenes in A. annua.RT-PCR was also used to confirm the expression of novel transcripts and singletons. A set of 18 novel transcripts and singletons was randomly selected to test if they are indeed expressed in GT (Figure 4B). Of the 20 primer pairs, 13 produced RT-PCR products that were of the correct size and whose sequence matched the sequences from which the primers were designed. Based on these results, we conclude that many of the novel transcripts and singletons detected among the 454-ESTs are not due to the sequencing artifacts. This result provides further evidence for the value of tissue specific 454 sequencing for gene discovery.","As the sole plant source for artemisinin production, the A. annua has been studied extensively for the past decades. Like most other non-model plant species, it has lacked genetic and genomic resources necessary for mechanistic study. Although a precise estimate of transcriptome coverage is unattainable without full genomic sequence, we appear to have recovered a significantly portion of the A. annua glandular trichome transcriptome. Novel transcripts detected highlights the hypothesis-expanding aspects of 454 deep pyrosequencing approach, which potentially facilitate the understanding of glandular trichome metabolic function. The assembled sequence data also provided a rich source of information for further investigation.Two consecutive pyrosequencing runs identified a large number of genes expressed in glandular trichomes. In data analysis, approximately 85% of the pyrosequencing assemblies did not align to any ESTs available in GenBank. This high proportion could reflect the specialized cell type that was sampled or perhaps the greater complexity of the A. annua genome. Because our priority goal in this study is gene discovery, we therefore chose normalized cDNA population to reduce oversampling of abundant transcripts and to maximize coverage of less abundant transcripts present in the sample. The average contig length was fairly short (~334 bp), and only 62% of the sequence reads assembled into contigs, leaving 147,699 singletons.Genes involved in plant secondary metabolism have frequently been identified by EST approach. The lower cost and greater sequence coverage offered by pyrosequencing makes it possible to identify more candidate genes involved in plant natural product biosynthetic pathways, esp. those with low abundance and often missed by conventional EST projects. For non-model species with little or no genomic data available, such as A. annua, pyrosequencing offers rapid characterization of a large portion of the transcriptome and therefore provides a comprehensive tool for gene discovery. However, one limitation of pyrosequencing is that one must rely on RACE PCR in order to obtain full-length sequence data for a given gene of interest.Comparison between our glandular trichome 454 ESTs with conventional ESTs generated from trichomes of other plant species revealed likely common function in non-glandular and glandular trichomes. In addition, some unigenes corresponding to enzymes in sesquiterpene biosynthesis were found to be highly expressed in both trichome types in our RT-PCR analysis. Although it has been suggested that glandular trichomes are the site for synthesis and accumulation of plant secondary metabolites, it will be interesting to further investigate the different functional roles of non-glandular trichomes in artemisinin biosynthesis.","In conclusion, we describe the global analysis of glandular trichome in A. annua using massively parallel pyrosequencing. Mining the pyrosequencing ESTs resulted in the identification of many contigs likely involved in terpenoid biosynthesis and trichome function. Functional characterizations of selected genes are being carried out. These pyrosequencing data form the basis for further characterization of the molecular mechanism of glandular trichome function in A. annua. The results also highlight the value of using tissue-specific high throughput pyrosequencing technology for gene discovery in non-model plants. Access to all EST contigs obtained in this study is facilitated through a file available in the supplemental data (see Additional file 4)."
1,TA043628,10.1155/2022/2672150,In Vitro Cercaricidal and Schistosomicidal Activities of the Raffia Wine andHydroethanolic Extracts of Pedilanthus tithymaloides Linn (Poit). Stem Barks.,"Schistosomiasis control remains a public health concern, and there is a need toevaluate new strategies for targeting larval and adult stages of the parasite. AsPedilanthus tithymaloides is empirically used to treat schistosomiasis, itbecomes essential to know its effective action scientifically. This studyassessed the cercaricidal and schistosomicidal activity of P. tithymaloides stembarks raffia wine extract (RwPt) and hydroethanolic extract (HePt). Differentconcentrations of these extracts were tested against cercariae (31.25-1000 μg/mL)and adult worms (62.5-2000 μg/mL) of Schistosoma mansoni. Niclosamide-olamine 5%(1 μg/mL) and praziquantel (10 μg/mL) were used as pharmacological controls.Cercariae viability was determined every 30 min for 180 min, and adult worms'motor activity and viability after 24 and 48 h incubation. In addition,cytotoxicity and phytochemical analysis were performed. HePt was lethal tocercariae and adult worms with LC(50) of 73.91 μg/mL after 60 min of incubationand 731.17 μg/mL after 48 h of incubation, respectively. Furthermore, asignificant reduction of 94.44% in motor activity was observed in surviving wormsat the concentration of 2000 μg/mL. RwPt was less effective on S. mansonicercariae with an LC(50) of 617.86 μg/mL after 180 min and on adult worms with amortality rate of 9.83% at 2000 μg/mL for 48 h incubation. Both extracts showed aweak cytotoxicity profile with an IC(50) of 983.50 μg/mL for HePt and more than1000 μg/mL for RwPt. The LC-MS analysis of HePt allowed the detection of twoannotated diterpenoids. Based on the selectivity index, the hydroethanolicextract of P. tithymaloides stem barks disclosed an intense cercaricidal activityand a moderate schistosomicidal effect with low cytotoxicity. These findings maysupport the potential use of Pedilanthus tithymaloides as a natural product or asource of natural-derived compounds for interrupting schistosomiasistransmission.","Tienga Nkondo, Emilienne, Boukeng Jatsa, Hermine, Gipwe Feussom, Nestor, Kenfack, Mérimé Christian, Membe Femoe, Ulrich, Tamdem Guetchueng, Stephanie, Kopa Kowa, Theodora, Kamtchouing, Pierre, Tchuem Tchuente, Louis-Albert",2022,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2,False,False,True,"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the blood-dwelling fluke Schistosoma. Human schistosomiasis is the second most devastating tropical disease after malaria and remains a major public health problem. The World Health Organization estimated that 236 million people in the tropics and subtropics required preventive treatment in 2019, and 90% resided in Africa. Schistosomiasis is endemic in 78 countries, causing roughly 70 million disability-adjusted life years. Schistosoma infection is also associated with high morbidity in human populations worldwide, with about 280,000 annual deaths related to its parasitism and complications. Schistosoma mansoni, the most widespread species, causes a yearly infection of 54 million people, and 393 million are at risk of getting infected in sub-Saharan Africa. Infection occurs when free-swimming larvae, cercariae, released by various snail intermediate hosts penetrate the human host's skin while in contact with contaminated freshwater.There is no effective vaccine, and the main strategy for schistosomiasis control relies on mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel (PZQ). Although PZQ is effective against adult forms of all schistosome species, it is inefficient against larval and juvenile worms and, therefore, unable to prevent reinfection and stop parasite transmission. In addition, repeated rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with PZQ have led to therapeutic failures in disease-endemic areas, raising the possibility of drug resistance. Indeed, Schistosoma isolates with reduced susceptibility to PZQ have already been identified, leading to concerns regarding treatment-resistant parasites. Hence, there is a rising need for new therapeutic alternatives. Therefore, searching for bioactive natural products against Schistosoma is essential for establishing future strategies to control schistosomiasis. In addition to treating infected individuals, interrupting people's contact with the infectious larvae cercariae could help avoid infection.In this regard, several in vitro studies have already been performed to search for new active compounds from medicinal plants against different stages of S. mansoni, and promising results have been reported. Pedilanthus tithymaloides (Linn) Poit., also known as Euphorbia tithymaloides, is a common succulent shrub native to tropical and subtropical America belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. The plant is actively used in India, Brazil, and Madagascar. Literature reported a wide range of healing properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, wound healing activity, larvicidal, antimalarial and antituberculous, anthelmintic, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antidiabetic. The plant is widespread as ornamental in Cameroon's Littoral, Centre, East, Adamawa, and North regions. Some communities of the Littoral region mix the stem bark of this plant with raffia wine, boil the mixture, and drink it to treat schistosomiasis. Even though its biological potential has been proved against several microorganisms, the biological activity of P. tithymaloides against the life stages of S. mansoni has not yet been assessed. This study was carried out to evaluate the in vitro activities of the raffia wine extract and the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark on cercariae and adult worms of S. mansoni and to establish the extracts' cytotoxicity and phytochemical profiles."," Pedilanthus tithymaloides (Linn) Poit. was harvested in May 2015 in the locality of Loum in the Littoral region of Cameroon. Botanical identification of a plant sample was performed at the “National Herbarium” of Yaounde, Cameroon, and a voucher specimen number 25714/SRF/Cam was deposited.After plant collection, the raffia wine extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark was prepared as described by the traditional healer. First, barks (1500 g) were removed from the stems, cleaned, and boiled in fresh raffia wine (5 L). Next, the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (BÜCHI B-480), frozen, and then lyophilized to give the wine extract (RwPt) with an extraction yield of 2.64% w/w. For hydroethanolic extraction, the stem bark of P. tithymaloides was dried and powdered. Afterward, the powder (100 g) was boiled in 20% ethanol (1 L) for 2 h using a reflux design. Next, the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (BÜCHI B-480), frozen, and then lyophilized to obtain the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark (HePt) with an extraction yield of 11.18% w/w.All experiments in this study followed the principles of laboratory animals' use and care of the “European Community” guidelines (EEC Directive 2010/63/EEC). The protocol for experimental design was approved by the “Animal Ethical Committee” of the Laboratory of Animal Physiology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon.Raffia wine and hydroethanolic extracts of P. tithymaloides stem bark were tested for cercaricidal activity following the procedure previously described by some authors. S. mansoni cercariae were obtained by photostimulation of experimentally infected Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails. Briefly, 20 to 25 cercariae-shed snails were pooled into a glass beaker containing 20 mL of distilled water and exposed to artificial light for 2 hours. Snails were removed from the beaker, and the cercarial suspension was used for the assays. An average of 20 freshly shed cercariae were counted in 100 μL of the suspension and transferred into each well of a 24 microtiter well plate under an inverted microscope (Olympus C.K. 2).The raffia wine or hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark was dissolved in distilled water, and a stock solution of 2000 μg/mL was obtained. Then, concentrations of 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 μg/mL were prepared by serial dilutions of the stock solution. Finally, each concentration was added to each well containing 20 cercariae for a final volume of 1 mL. Distilled water was set up as a control, and niclosamide-olamine 5% (1 g/mL) (Jiangsu Aijin Agrochemical Co., Ltd, China) as a pharmacological control. Each concentration was assayed in quadruplicates, and the experiments were replicated. The cercariae's viability assessment was performed for 180 minutes at 30 minutes intervals using an inverted microscope (Olympus C.K. 2). Cercariae were considered dead when they stopped movement and sank down, and their tail was detached. The LC50 value of P. tithymaloides raffia wine or hydroethanolic extract on S. mansoni cercariae was determined at different time points by interpolation from the “restricted cubic spline curve” (nonlinear regression). The minimal lethal concentration (MLC) (minimum concentration needed to kill all cercariae) and the minimal effective concentration (MEC) (minimum concentration required to observe any change in viability or morphology of cercariae) were determined after 180 minutes.Balb/c mice weighing 20–25 g were infected with 130 cercariae of S. mansoni released from experimentally infected B. pfeifferi by the tail and leg immersion technique. After 49 days, adult worms were recovered from mice's mesenteric veins and liver by perfusion with a sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl). Freshly harvested worms were washed three times in a Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium (GMEM) (Sigma, St Louis, USA) supplemented with an antibiotic-antimycotic solution (10,000 U/mL penicillin, 10,000 μg/mL streptomycin, and 25 μg/mL amphotericin B) (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, USA) and gentamicin (40 μg/mL).The bioassay followed the standard operating procedures that recommended at least five female and five male worms per well. Therefore, 10 adult worms of both sexes were transferred to each well of a 24-well culture plate with 1900 μL of complete GMEM, pH 7.5 (GMEM with 20 mM of HEPES, 40 μg/mL gentamicin, 50 μg/mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 μg/mL neomycin, 2 mM of L-glutamine, and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum). The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 to allow acclimatization.After acclimatization of worms, the raffia wine extract (RwPt) or the hydroethanolic extract (HePt) of P. tithymaloïdes stem bark was dissolved in distilled water, passed through a 0.2 μm sterile syringe filter, and added to each well for final concentrations of 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 μg/mL in a final volume of 2 mL. Worms incubated in GMEM alone or praziquantel (10 μg/mL) were used as negative or positive controls, respectively. Each concentration was tested in quadruplicates, and the experiments were repeated. Worms were incubated for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2, and monitored every 24 h to evaluate their motor activity and viability under an inverted microscope (Olympus C.K. 2). Viability was determined based on the standard operating procedures for screening schistosomicidal compounds described previously ((+ + +) indicates normal activity; (+ +) slight loss of movement with active tail, suckers, and gynecophoric canal membrane; (+) movement of tails and suckers alone; and (−) no movement). Worms showing no sign of motility for 1 minute, associated with worm deformities such as blackening, twisting, and contracting, were considered dead. The median lethal concentration (LC50) was calculated using the Trimmed Spearman–Karber (TSK) method, version 1.5 software downloaded from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.The cytotoxicity analysis of the raffia wine and hydroethanolic extracts of P. tithymaloides was assessed using a C57/L melanoma liver cell line (Hepa 1–6 ATCC CRL-1830) based on the WST-8 assay. Cells were cultured in a high-glucose Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) with pyruvate and L-glutamine (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Serana, Australia) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA). The cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. Monolayer cultures reaching a confluence between 80 and 90% were detached using trypsin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and calibrated with a cell counter (Fast Read 102). The calibrated cell suspension was seeded into 96-well plates at 1 × 104 cells per well and incubated overnight for cell adhesion. Afterward, the medium was replaced with a fresh one, and cells were exposed to different concentrations (15.625, 31.25, 62.50, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 μg/mL) of the extracts for 24 hours. Cells incubated in DMEM alone served as controls. Each concentration was tested in duplicates, and the experiment was repeated three times. Cells viability was measured by their mitochondrial activity in reducing 2-(2-methoxy-4- nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2, 4- disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt to formazan using the Cell Counting kit-8 (WST-8, Abcam, ab228554, U.K.), according to the manufacturer instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Dynex MRX TC II microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, USA). Results were expressed as the percentage of cell growth, and the concentration of each extract required to inhibit cell growth by 50% (IC50) was calculated.The degree of selectivity of each extract was measured as the ratio between the IC50 obtained for the cell line and the LC50 for S. mansoni cercariae or adult worms.Selectivity index = [IC50 of extract in cell line (μg/mL)]/[LC50 of the same extract in S. mansoni cercariae (μg/mL)].The LC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 1200 Series liquid chromatography system coupled to an Agilent accurate QTOF 6520 mass spectrometer (GenTech Scientific, USA). Compounds were separated at room temperature on a Zorbax SB-C18 (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm; Agilent Technologies, USA). The sample (1 mg/mL) was prepared in an HPLC-grade ACN followed by filtration through a Millipore filter (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, France) and the injection volume was 0.8 μL. The mobile phase was constituted of acetonitrile (containing 0.05% formic acid) and water (containing 0.05% formic acid). The method was as follows: 98% of ACN for 0.1 min, then 0% ACN for 8 min, followed by 0% ACN for 12.5 min, and then 98% of ACN for 25 min. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min, and UV detection was set at 210 nm. For mass spectra acquisition, an Agilent accurate QTOF 6520 mass spectrometer with an electrospray interface in the positive mode (ESI+), temperature 340°C, and an ion spray of 4000 V was used. Sample cone voltage was set at 120 V, and mass spectra were recorded in the range m/z 50–2000. Nitrogen was used as nebulizer gas, and the nebulizer pressure was set at 30 psi. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with MassHunter Workstation software (Version B.04.00). The annotated compounds were drawn using Chemdraw Professional 15.0 (PerkinElmer informatics Inc., USA).Data analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.02 software (San Diego, CA, USA). All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Significant differences between mean values were determined by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for cercaricidal activity and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for schistosomicidal activity, followed by the Tukey multiple-comparison test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.","Different extracts of Pedilanthus tithymaloides stem bark showed varying cercaricidal potency against S. mansoni cercariae (Figure 1).Effects of different concentrations of P. tithymaloides raffia wine extract (RwPt) on the viability of S. mansoni cercariae after incubation for up to 180 min are depicted in Figure 1(a). Following incubation with RwPt, a time- and dose-dependent decrease in the viability of cercariae was recorded. The reduction was insignificant for concentrations ranging from 31.25 to 125 μg/mL. A significant decrease in cercariae viability was recorded only for concentrations from 250 to 1000 μg/μL. Still, it was less relevant than that of niclosamide-olamine 5% at the same time point (∗∗∗p < 0.001). Thus, cercariae incubated with 250 and 500 μg/mL of RwPt showed the highest mortality rate of 18.93% (p < 0.001) and 34.27% (p < 0.001), respectively, at 180 min. At the highest concentration of 1000 μg/mL, a slight reduction in cercariae viability appears within 60 min of incubation (16.45%), rising to 36.72% after 90 min, and became significant (p < 0.001) after 150 min (90.92%) and 180 min (100%). Cercariae remained viable for up to 180 min in the control group (Figure 1(a)). The minimal effective concentration (MEC) and the minimal lethal concentration (MLC) of the raffia wine extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark were 250 and 1000 μg/mL, respectively, after 180 min of incubation (Table 1).The exposure of cercariae to P. tithymaloides hydroethanolic extract (HePt) for 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min showed a time- and dose-dependent decrease in cercariae viability (Figure 1(b)). Within 60 min of incubation, all cercariae were dead at concentrations ranging from 125 to 1000 μg/mL (p < 0.001), and there was no statistical difference with the reference drug niclosamide-olamine 5%. At 31.25 and 62.5 μg/mL, a 14% cercariae mortality rate was recorded as compared to controls wells (p < 0.05). It was, however, less significant than the 100% mortality rate of niclosamide-olamine. After 150 min incubation, mortality rates of 93.60% and 100% were reached at 31.25 μg/mL and 62.5 μg/mL, respectively (p < 0.001). Cercariae remained viable for up to 180 min in the control group (Figure 1(b)). The minimal effective concentration (MEC) of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark was 31.25 μg/mL after 150 min of incubation, and the minimal lethal concentration (MLC) was 62.5 μg/mL at the same time point (Table 1).The median lethal concentration (LC50) of P. tithymaloides extracts was determined at each time point (Table 1). The LC50 of the raffia wine extract (RwPt) could only be calculated at 150 min and 180 min incubation. The LC50 values of the hydroethanolic extract (HePt) decreased time dependently from 60 to 150 min of incubation. At 180 min time point, the LC50 of RwPt was 617.86 ± 34.65 μg/mL, and that of HePt was 19.26 ± 1.22 μg/mL (Table 1). The hydroethanolic extract (HePt) showed more pronounced cercaricidal potency than the raffia wine extract (RwPt).The schistosomicidal activity of different extracts of P. tithymaloides stem bark was assessed by microscopic observation of S. mansoni adult worms incubated at different concentrations (62.5–2000 μg/mL) to check their motor activity and to determine the mortality rate using a viability scale. Results are shown in Table 2.Control worms incubated only in the culture medium remained viable up to 48 h even though some displayed weak motor activity reduction. Incubation of adult S. mansoni worms with RwPt did not result in any worms' death at all concentrations after 24 h. Only a low mortality rate of 9.83% and 18.07% reduction of worms' motor activity were recorded at the highest concentration of 2000 μg/mL after 48 h of incubation. The LC50 of RwPt was then greater than 2000 μg/mL (Table 2). The minimal motor activity was marked by the absence of worm motility apart from gut movements, weak movement of the suckers, and occasional waves of the body.Following exposure of adult worms to HePt, the mortality rate increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. After 24 h of incubation, mortality rates of 10.98% and 25.60% were recorded at 1000 and 2000 μg/mL, respectively. They were associated with reduced motility of surviving worms by 19.08% and 26.54%. After 48 h incubation, the mortality rates increased to 66.34% and 86.47% (p < 0.001) at 1000 and 2000 μg/mL, respectively. At the same time, motor activity declined by 82.54% and 94.44%, respectively (Table 2).The concentration of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark necessary to kill 50% of worms (LC50) was 731.17 μg/mL (365.74–1047.43 μg/mL) after 48 h incubation. Although HePt exhibited a lethal action on male and female worms, male worms seemed more sensitive than females. At the highest concentration of 2000 μg/mL, 95.15% of male worms were killed against 78.33% of females (Table 2).In the pharmacological control group incubated with 10 μg/mL of praziquantel, parasite death was observed within 24 h post-incubation.After 24 h incubation of mouse hepatic melanoma cells (Hepa 1–6 cells) with different concentrations (15.625 to 1000 μg/mL) of raffia wine (RwPt) or hydroethanolic extract (HePt) of P. tithymaloides stem bark, the inhibition rate on cell proliferation increased in a concentration-dependent manner. It reached 32.27% and 50.17% for RwPt and HePt, respectively, at the highest 1000 μg/mL concentration. Based on their inhibitory activity, the IC50 of RwPt was more than 1000 μg/mL, and that of HePt was 983.50 ± 7.75 μg/mL (Table 3).The selectivity index (SI) was calculated based on plant extracts' anthelmintic activity and cytotoxicity profile. The selectivity index of HePt was 13.31 at 60 min and 51.06 at 150 min time points for the cercaricidal activity and 1.34 for the schistosomicidal activity. However, the IC50 of RwPt was more than 1000 μg/mL, and its LC50 was more than 2000 μg/mL for the schistosomicidal effect. Therefore, its selectivity index will be greater than 1.50 for cercaricidal activity and less than 1 for schistosomicidal activity (Table 3).Analysis of the LC-MS chromatogram of the hydroethanolic extract from the stem bark of P. tithymaloides and comparison of the observed MS data with reported literature data on previously isolated compounds from the genus Pedilanthus and also with MS data of natural compounds listed in the Dictionary of Natural Products (https://dnp.chenetbase.com) revealed the possible presence of jatrophane diterpenes. The HPLC-MS showed two significant peaks with retention times (Rt) at 7.675 and 7.963 min (Figure 2(a)). The peak at Rt = 7.675 min corresponding to the molecular ion [M+Na]+ detected at m/z 739.2914 (Figure 2(b)) was annotated to the jatrophane diterpene 7, 8β, 9β, 14α,15β-pentaacetoxy-3β-benzoyloxy-1α, 5β-dihydroxyjatropha-6(7), 12-diene (1). The other peak at Rt = 7.963 min was annotated to a jatrophane diterpene, 1α, 7, 8β, 9β, 14α, 15β-hexaacetoxy-3β-benzoyloxy-5β-hydroxyjatropha-6(7), 12-diene (2) corresponding to the molecular ion [M+Na]+ detected at m/z 781.3040 (Figure 2(c)) (Table 4). Both compounds were previously reported from the methanolic extract of P. tithymaloides latex. The chemical structures of these compounds are depicted in Figure 3.","The search for new anti-Schistosoma drugs has intensified due to the report of some S. mansoni strains probably resistant to the reference drug, praziquantel. Consequently, there is an urgent need to discover cheap and safe alternatives for schistosomiasis control.Using medicinal plants as the best approach to identify new compounds to control schistosomiasis is one of the viable and promising research leads. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the potential effects of plant-derived products on cercariae and adult worms of S. mansoni. Although the wide range of its pharmacological properties, the biological activities of Pedilanthus tithymaloides against the life stages of S. mansoni have not yet been reported. In this context, we have highlighted the antischistosomal activity of P. tithymaloides by in vitro tests using raffia wine and hydroethanolic extracts of the stem bark on S. mansoni cercariae and adult worms. In vitro tests with different stages of Schistosoma are valuable tools to evaluate the schistosomicidal properties of a drug and determine its mode of action. According to Moraes et al., compounds with schistosomicidal activity can be effective in different ways: prophylactically by causing the death of cercariae and/or schistosomula, suppressively by inhibiting oviposition, and curatively by causing the death of adult worms. Therefore, we firstly examined the activity of the raffia wine and hydroethanolic extracts of P. tithymaloides against S. mansoni cercariae. Infection with schistosomes occurs when cercariae pass through unbroken skin and enter the body. As a result, interrupting the cercarial penetration into the skin is a potential mode of interrupting schistosomiasis transmission and thus the disease. Results of the current study showed varying cercaricidal activity of plant extracts. Although both extracts have inhibited cercariae viability, the hydroethanolic extract was the most potent by killing all cercariae over 60 minutes without any significant cytotoxicity against mouse hepatoma cells when tested at the same range of concentrations.Our findings are comparable to the reported data on Rauwolfia vomitoria, Ozoroa pulcherrima, Eryngium triquetrum, Balanites aegyptiaca, Caralluma dalzielli, Sida acuta, and Sida rhombifolia. However, at the same time of incubation (120 min), the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides was more potent than R. vomitoria ethanolic extract and O. pulcherrima aqueous extract. On the other hand, it was less active than O. pulcherrima methanolic extract and S. acuta and S. rhombifolia hydroethanolic extracts. Furthermore, researchers correlated the cercaricidal activity of plant extracts with their secondary metabolites. Various bioactive constituents such as steroids, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, phenols, diterpenes, triterpenes, coumarins, and saponins have already been identified in Pedilanthus sp.. Therefore, although other possible active compounds might be present in the extract, we could link the cercaricidal activity of P. tithymaloides to the annotated diterpenoids 1 and 2. It has also been reported that the efficacy of Origanum compactum against S. haematobium cercariae was attributed to its terpenoids. Most recently, Mohammed et al. have assigned the anthelmintic activity of the aqueous extract of Caralluma dalzielli against the cercariae stage of S. mansoni to his high terpenoids content. On the other hand, Raveen et al. have stipulated that the larvicidal action of P. tithymaloides leaves against the vector of the dengue fever Aedes aegypti could be assigned to flavonoids, phenols, and steroids that induced larval mortality. Moreover, the latex from Euphorbia sp. has been shown to act on both the snail vector and the parasite. Consequently, we could ascribe the cercaricidal activity of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark to its terpenoids, phenols, flavonoids, and steroids contents.The ability of P. tithymaloides to kill both adult male and female schistosomes was also evaluated during this study. Our results showed that the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark induced worms' death associated with the significantly reduced motor activity of surviving ones. Previous assays screening the schistosomicidal activity of some plant extracts or isolated compounds have revealed similar results. However, the difference in survival time between male and female worms suggested that males were more susceptible than females. Similar findings were reported by others while exposing schistosomes to medicinal plant-derived compounds or products such as Garcinielliptone FC, dihydrocitronellol, an alkaloid-rich fraction from Ruta graveolens L., and the Brazilian red propolis. The schistosomicidal activity of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark may be due to its jatrophane diterpenoids. Such compounds have been previously identified in the methanolic extract of P. tithymaloides latex. Furthermore, they have been reported for their antimalarial and antituberculous activities and antiplasmodial activity against the K1 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Additionally, some terpenoids are known to kill adult S. mansoni worms by altering their cholinergic nervous system. The motility of schistosomes implies neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin, neuropeptides, and glutamate. The reduction in S. mansoni motor activity after incubation in the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark could be the consequence of its interference with the mechanism of concentration-relaxation of worm's smooth muscles. It has also been demonstrated that terpenoids cause complete separation of paired worms and tegumental disruption. Through this action, they can impair the parasite's motility. Therefore, the effectiveness of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark against S. mansoni worms may be due, at least in part, to the jatrophane diterpenoids.Establishing that a drug candidate cannot induce cytotoxicity at therapeutic concentrations is crucial. The US NCI plant screening program stipulates that a crude extract with in vitro cytotoxic activity has an IC50 less than 20 μg/mL following incubation of cells between 48 h and 72 h. According to this, IC50 of the hydroethanolic extract (983.50 μg/mL) was approximately 50 times greater than 20 μg/mL, indicating the very low cytotoxicity of this extract on mouse hepatoma cell lines. The relative effectiveness of a drug candidate in inhibiting parasite growth compared to inducing cell death is defined as the therapeutic index or selectivity index. Therefore, it is desirable to have a high therapeutic index (>2), giving a maximum anthelmintic activity with minimal toxicity on the cells. The selectivity index of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark was 19.26 for cercaricidal activity and 1.34 for schistosomicidal activity. These findings reveal that this extract is strongly active against S. mansoni cercariae but relatively effective against adult schistosomes.","The results of the current study provide evidence of the predominant cercaricidal activity and the moderate schistosomicidal activity of the hydroethanolic extract of Pedilanthus tithymaloides stem bark, with no cytotoxicity on mouse hepatoma cells. Also, we annotated two jatrophane diterpenes from this active extract. These findings may support the potential use of Pedilanthus tithymaloides as a natural product or a source of natural-derived compounds for interrupting schistosomiasis transmission. However, further investigations are in progress to disclose the pharmacological effects of these plant extracts through in vivo models of Schistosoma mansoni infection."

Electron micrograph has been taken using Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) at National Research Centre (NRC), Egypt (Figure [4a](#page-2-2)) ', '*3.5. large-scale fermentation and isolation* The spore suspension of strain LGO5 was inoculated into 100 mL of ISP2 medium and cultivated at 30 ◦C for 3 days as seed culture. 5 mL of seed culture were aseptically transferred to inoculate 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks (12 flasks) containing modified rice medium composition: 100 g commercial rice and 100 mL 50% sea water containing 0.4% yeast extract and 1% malt extract. The flasks were incubated for 14 days at 35 ◦C. After harvesting, the obtained broth was macerated in methanol (2.5 L). The methanol extract was separated by filtration, and concentrated *in vacuo*, and the remaining water residue was re-extracted with ethyl acetate. The obtained ethyl acetate extract was finally concentrated *in vacuo* to dryness and then further purified. The crude extract (3.9 g) was separated by column chromatography on silica gel (60 × 3 cm) with a cyclohexane/dichloromethane (DCM)/methanol (MeOH) gradient, 0.5 L cyclohexane, 0.5 L cyclohexane/ DCM [8:2], 0.5 L cyclohexane/DCM [6:4], 0.5 L cyclohexane/DCM [4:6], 0.5 L cyclohexane/DCM [2:8], 0.5 L DCM, 0.3 L DCM/MeOH [97:3], 0.3 L DCM/MeOH [95:5], 0.3 L DCM/MeOH [90:10], 0.3L DCM/MeOH [80:20], and 0.3 L MeOH. According to TLC monitoring, three fractions were obtained: FI (0.97 g), FII (1.2 g), and FIII (0.3 g). Fraction FI was highly nonpolar, mostly fats, and was discarded. Purification of FII on Sephadex LH-20 (CH2Cl2/40% MeOH) yielded anthranilic acid (1 mg) and indole-3-acetic acid (1.2 mg) in addition to four sub-fractions, FIIa, FIIb, FIIc, and FIId. Sub-fraction FIIa was purified using Sephadex LH-20 (CH2Cl2/40% MeOH) to afford terretonin N (**1**, 8 mg) as colorless needles. The diastereomers (3*R*,4*R*)-3,4-dihydroxy-3-methylpentan-2-one and (3*S*,4*R*)-3,4-dihydroxy-3-methylpentan-2-one (6 mg) were obtained as colourless oil from sub-fraction FIIb after its application to silica gel (column 60 × 1.5 cm) and elution with CH2Cl2/MeOH gradient. Further purification of sub-fraction FIIc on Sephadex LH-20 (CH2Cl2/40% MeOH) gave (2 mg) of tryptamine. The last sub-fraction FIId was purified on Sephadex LH-20 (CH2Cl2/40% MeOH) to afford terrein (4 mg). Finally, application of fraction FIII to Sephadex LH-20 (CH2Cl2/40% MeOH) afforded sitosteryl-3β-D-glucoside (3 mg) as colorless solid.

We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['**2. results and discussion 2. results and discussion** ', '*2.1. isolation and maintenance of the producing strain 2.1. isolation and maintenance of the producing strain* The strain *Nocardiopsis* sp.

The <sup>13</sup>C/DEPT/HSQC NMR spectra showed 26 resonance signals, corresponding to seven methyl groups (δ<sup>C</sup> 24.2–14.6 [C-20–25,27]), three methylene groups (δ<sup>C</sup> 50.3–22.5 [C-1,2,7]), and seven methine groups, among them four *sp*<sup>3</sup> oxymethine groups (δ<sup>C</sup> 79.4–76.0 [C-3,6,11,17]) and three non-oxygenated ones (δ<sup>C</sup> 61.3–51.5 [C-5,9,14]). Nine quaternary carbons were found, among them one ketone carbonyl (206.8, C-18), two ester carbonyls of an α-lactone (δ<sup>C</sup> 169.4, C-15) and an acetate residue (δ<sup>C</sup> 170.6, C-26), and two *sp*<sup>2</sup> carbons for an exocyclic double bond (δ<sup>C</sup> 147.9 [C-12], 114.5 [C-19]). Further four quaternary carbons resonate in the aliphatic region (δ<sup>C</sup> 50.0–37.1 [C-4,8,10,13]). The evidence mentioned above and the eight double bond equivalents deduced from the molecular formula suggested that compound **1** is a tetracyclic compound. According to H,H-COSY and HMBC experiments (Figure [6\\)](#page-5-0), compound **1** shows the following structural features: In ring A, the acetate residue is connected to the hydroxyl group at position 3 due to a visible <sup>3</sup> *J* HMBC correlation between H-3 and C-26 (170.6). The *gem*-methyls (C-21,22) are attached to C-4. In ring B, the clear HMBC correlations from H-6 (4.35) to C-10 (38.1) and C-8 (37.1), and the H,H-COSY crosspeaks between H-6 and both neighboring protons (H-5 [1.25] and H-7 [2.74, 1.19]), completed the assignment. The HMBC correlations between H3-20 (1.68) and carbons C-1, 5, 9, and 10 established the fusion between rings A and B via C-5 and C-10. Alternatively, the direct fusion between rings B and C was proven through carbons C-8 and C-9 as the existence of an HMBC correlation from H3-23 (2.03) versus carbons C-7,8,9, and 14. The assignment of the vinylidene moiety at C-12 is based on the <sup>3</sup> *J* HMBC correlations of corresponding methylene protons (H-19a/19b [5.06, 5.16]) with C-11 and C-13. The connectivity between rings C and D through C-13 and C-14 was verified by the HMBC correlation directed from the methyl H3-24 (1.62) towards C-12, 13, 14 and 18. The keto-lactone of ring D was identified by the <sup>3</sup> *J* HMBC crosspeak between H-17 (4.81) and the lactone carbonyl C-15 (169.4), while the doublet methyl H3-25 (1.38) exhibited a <sup>3</sup> *J* correlation towards the ketone carbonyl C-18 (206.8). According to the chromatographic behavior and based on the spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analyses together with data base searches, structure **1** was confirmed as a new meroterpenoidal/sesterterpenoidal compound and was given the trivial name terretonin N. ![](_page_5_Figure_1.jpeg) *Molecules* **2018**, *23*, x 6 of 12 <span id=""page-5-0""></span>*Molecules* **2018**, *23*, x 6 of 12 *Molecules* **2018**, *23*, x 6 of 12 *Molecules* **2018**, *23*, x 6 of 12 **Figure 6.** COSY ( ) and key HMBC ( ) correlations of terretonin N (**1**). **Figure 6.** COSY ( **Figure 6.** COSY ( ) and key HMBC ( ) correlations of terretonin N (**1**). ) and key HMBC ( **Figure 6.** COSY ( ) and key HMBC ( ) correlations of terretonin N (**1**). ) correlations of terretonin N (**1**). **Figure 6.** COSY ( ) and key HMBC ( ) correlations of terretonin N (**1**). **Figure 6.** COSY ( ) and key HMBC ( ) correlations of terretonin N (**1**).

Since the discovery of terpenes (more than 150 years ago), researchers have reported approximately 50,000 different terpenes derived from plants and fungi. Bacteria and other microorganisms are known to produce terpenes as well. However, they have received much less attention [\\[31](#page-11-4)[,32\\]](#page-11-5). Cane et al. (Brown University, Providence, RI, USA) have proven the genetic capacity of bacteria to create terpenes with structural diversity [\\[33](#page-11-6)[–36\\]](#page-11-7). During their studies 15 years ago, they have concluded, through the genome data gathered from many *Streptomyces* spp., that the latter have gene sequences that are similar to those encoding terpene synthases in plants and fungi. Consequently, they proved that actinobacteria indeed have genes for terpene synthases and that those enzymes could be used to make terpenes [\\[37,](#page-11-8)[38\\]](#page-11-9). Terretonins are meroterpenoids biosynthetically derived from 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid (DMOA), which is cyclized by terpene cyclase to form a terpenoid [\\[39\\]](#page-11-10). Recently, it has been reported that bacteria harbor numerous genes coding for terpene cyclases [\\[40\\]](#page-11-11), in addition to terpene synthases, which are widely distributed in bacteria as well [\\[11\\]](#page-10-4). This underscores the eminent capability of bacteria to produce terpenoids with high similarity to those obtained from fungi. For example, merochlorin A, a sesterterpenoid, has been isolated from *Streptomyces* sp. [\\[41\\]](#page-11-12). Further intensive search in the literature and in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database [\\(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/) [protein/\\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/) revealed that thousands of gene cluster homologs encoding enzymes proposed to be involved in terretonin biosynthesis [\\[42\\]](#page-11-13) have been identified in actinobacteria. These enzymes include terpene synthase and terpene cyclase, aromatic prenyltransferase, monooxygenase, polyketide synthases, methyltransferase, phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase, epoxidase, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, and short chain dehydrogenases. Such kinds of enzymes commonly exist in the bacterial systems as well. Additional studies and approaches are required to support the production of terretonins from bacteria, including the study of the full bacterial genome to characterize the gene cluster for terretonin biosynthesis.

3,TA019019,10.3390/insects10040118,Volatiles from Different Instars of Honeybee Worker Larvae and Their Food.,"(E)-β-Ocimene was the only volatile chemical found to be emitted by whole, liveworker larvae of Apis mellifera L. when sampling in the vapor phase. In additionto (E)-β-ocimene, there is evidence for the existence of other volatiles, but thechanges in their composition and contents remain unknown during larvaldevelopment, as are their differences from larvae to larval food. We investigatedvolatile components of worker larvae and larval food using solid phase dynamicextraction (SPDE) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Ninecompounds were identified with certainty and six tentatively, includingterpenoids, aldehydes, hydrocarbons, an ester and a ketone. The contents ofvolatiles in the second-instar worker larvae differ greatly from those in larvaeof other stages. This is mainly attributable to terpenoids, which resulted in thesecond-instar worker larvae having significantly higher amounts of overallvolatiles. Larval food contained significantly higher amounts of aldehydes andhydrocarbons than the corresponding larvae from the fourth to fifth-instar. Wediscovered volatiles in worker larvae and their food that were never reportedbefore; we also determined the content changes of these volatiles during larvaldevelopment.","Zhang, Haohao, Hou, Chunsheng, Dai, Pingli, Liu, Yongjun, Wu, Yanyan, Pang, Yonggang, Diao, Qingyun",2019,Insects,2,True,False,True,"['**1. introduction** Volatiles occur in honey bee colonies as a complex mixture, determined by pheromones produced by bees, and other chemicals emitted by beeswax, honey, pollen and larval food [\\[1\\]](#page-12-0). These volatiles have been identified as alcohols, aldehydes, benzenoid compounds, carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons, ketones and terpenoids [\\[1\\]](#page-12-0). Volatiles in honey bee colonies are easily received by bees through antennal reception, sometimes over long distances. Therefore, using volatiles is an efficient means to moderate bee social behaviors. With regard to the volatiles that maintain social cohesion, most come from adult worker bees, such as the alarm pheromone inducing defensive behavior of honeybees [\\[2\\]](#page-12-1), the Nasanov pheromone triggering aggregation [\\[3\\]](#page-12-2), and other volatiles that transmit recognition cues. A few volatiles are detected in queens specifically [\\[4\\]](#page-12-3). Very little effort has been made to determine the volatiles emitted directly by intact and alive honey bee larvae. In contrast, the nonvolatile chemicals of honey bee larvae are widely studied by solvent extraction methods [\\[5](#page-13-0)[–7\\]](#page-13-1). (*E*)-β-Ocimene is the only identified volatile chemical produced by live worker larvae. There is evidence for the existence of other larval volatiles, because different chromatogram peaks in addition to (*E*)-β-ocimene were discovered [\\[8\\]](#page-13-2), but their compositions are not clear. There is also a lack of information about how these unknown larval volatiles change with larval ![](_page_0_Picture_17.jpeg) development. However, an understanding of the composition and content variation of volatiles during larval development is necessary for interpreting their functions. Food provided to honeybees could directly or indirectly affect honeybee volatile production. There is evidence that food shortages might stimulate worker bee larvae to release more (*E*)-β-ocimene [\\[9\\]](#page-13-3), and feeding honeybee worker larvae essential oils via diet supplements may change their volatiles [\\[10\\]](#page-13-4). However, the volatiles extracted from worker larval food have not been reported. Only volatile carboxylic acids were identified in drone larval food, and other unidentified non-acidic volatiles were noteworthy [\\[11\\]](#page-13-5). If the volatiles of the worker larval food were analyzed and combined with volatiles analysis of the worker larvae, it would provide a deep insight into the relationship between volatiles in larvae and their food during the same larval instar. In this paper, we analyzed the volatiles from worker larvae and their food at different instars, using solid phase dynamic extraction (SPDE) combined with high resolution gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through this research, we discovered new volatiles associated with developing worker larvae and their food that have been previously overlooked. ']","['**2. materials and methods** Three standard Chinese commercial strains of Western honeybee (*Apis mellifera ligustica* L.) were used in this experiment. Large double-deep colonies (30,000 to 50,000 adult bees) were located at our apiary in the Institute of Apicultural Research in Beijing (39◦ N, 116.2◦ E). Queens were caged within plastic controllers (interior dimensions: 457 × 50 × 245 mm, only allowed for passage of worker bees) to oviposit on empty new combs (without pollen and nectar stores) for 24 h and were then removed to the outside of the controllers. Oviposition combs were kept in the controllers. At each caging interval, we obtained three combs with single-age cohorts of worker larvae. Caging events were carried out seven times, for a total of 21 combs. After the combs were brought back to the laboratory, cells were randomly chosen to provide both the larval food and larvae samples for further analysis. Larvae and larval food was obtained with a small spatula. Larvae were inspected under the microscope, and only live and uninjured larvae were used for the study [\\[9\\]](#page-13-3). ', '*2.1. treatments* The volatiles of grouped larvae at three development stages were monitored. Group sizes were 20 second-instar (2nd-instar) larvae, 10 fourth-instar (4th-instar) larvae, and 10 fifth-instar (5th-instar) larvae. The larval food volatiles were also detected at different stages. To monitor changes in volatiles with respect to ontogeny, the amount of volatiles released by individual larva was determined [\\[8\\]](#page-13-2). To compare volatiles content between larvae and food, the amount of volatiles released per unit weight of sample were calculated [\\[12\\]](#page-13-6). Larvae and food were carefully transferred into 20 mL glass vials. Before analysis, 2 µL of 0.1 mg/L hexadecane hexane solution on a strip of filter paper was added as an internal standard for quantification. Clean empty vials were analyzed separately as controls to remove background interference. ', '*2.2. spde-gc-ms system* Volatile extraction was performed using SPDE (solid phase dynamic extraction) equipment installed in a CTC-Combi-PAL auto sampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland), as described by Castro [\\[13\\]](#page-13-7). The SPDE needle (SPDE-01/AC-50-56, 50 µm × 56 mm), coated with 90% polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and 10% active charcoal (AC) was preconditioned before use. The equilibration between sample and headspace lasted for 30 min at 35 ◦C in an incubation pool. After equilibration, the extraction procedure occurred as follows: An extraction volume of 1 mL, agitator temperature of 35 ◦C, headspace syringe temperature of 35 ◦C, −30 strokes, and a filling/ejecting speed of 25 µL/s. During the equilibration and extraction procedure, the larvae were alive and isolated from food for more than 45 min [\\[9\\]](#page-13-3). The needle was then withdrawn and introduced into the injection port of the gas chromatograph, and pumped with 1 mL nitrogen at 100 µL/s for desorption and at 250 ◦C for 2 min in splitless mode. GC-MS analysis was performed using a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph-2010 equipped with a DB-5ms capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) coupled to a Shimadzu Quadrupole-2010 Mass Spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The oven program was as follows: 35 ◦C for 2 min, 35–200 ◦C at 5 ◦C/min, 200 ◦C for 2 min, 200–250 ◦C at 10 ◦C/min, then 250 ◦<sup>C</sup> for 3 min. Injector temperature was maintained at 250 ◦C, transfer line temperature was 250 ◦C, and ion source temperature was 200 ◦C. Helium was used as the carrier gas, at a flow rate of 1.7 mL/min. ', '*2.3. qualitative and quantitative analysis* The identification of the compound with authentic standards was performed by comparing the mass spectra (Wiley6 and NIST05) and retention times to those of authentic standards. Compounds without standards were identified by comparing the mass spectrum peaks with data system libraries (Wiley6 and NIST05) and other published spectra (Mass Spectrometry Data Centre 1974). Additionally, the linear retention indices (LRI) of the compounds were calculated by injecting a series of n-alkanes (C10–C25) (o2si Smart Solutions) into the GC-MS on two columns of different polarities under identical conditions. Authentic standards (listed in Supplementary Data, Table S1) purchased from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany) were serially diluted with hexane to make standard solutions. The peak areas on the total ion chromatogram were used for quantification. The calibration curve derived from a step-series of standard compounds for individual target compounds was built by plotting the area ratio of target compounds to the internal standard against the concentration ratio. The concentrations of volatile compounds were calculated based on the corresponding calibration curves. ', '*2.4. statistical analysis* Principal component analysis (PCA) using a correlation matrix was applied to the data to establish relationships between the different samples and their volatile compounds. The SPSS software package Version 21 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. A one-way ANOVA (*p* < 0.05) was used to test for significant differences in volatile compound concentrations among treatments. Figures were created using SigmaPlot version 12 for Windows (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). ']nan","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['**4. discussion** Terpenoids have previously been reported as characteristic products of the Nasanov gland of worker bees and include nerol, geraniol, (*E*) and (*Z*)-citral, nerolic acid, geranic acid and (*E*, *E*)-farnesol [\\[14\\]](#page-13-8). (*E*)-β-Ocimene can be emitted by established mated queens [\\[4\\]](#page-12-3). In the present study, we found that terpenoids are the major constituents of worker bee larvae. Larvae and food at the 2nd instar had a greater similarity of dry substance weight per unit volume compared to other stages. Assuming that larvae and food at the 2nd instar had similar densities, larvae would have released significantly higher amount of terpenoids than food; thus, these terpenoids, such as (*Z*)-β-ocimene, (*E*)-β-ocimene, (*E*, *Z*)-alloocimene and α-terpineol, were likely produced by the larvae. Some terpene synthases have been identified in larvae [\\[9\\]](#page-13-3). The terpenoid concentration could be diluted in old larvae because body fluid accounts for most of their weight. Under these conditions, terpenoid contents in larvae were still significantly greater than in food, suggesting that compounds such as (*Z*)-β-ocimene, (*E*)-β-ocimene (t2) and (*E*, *Z*)-alloocimene could be identified as larval volatiles. (*E*)-β-ocimene was determined to be a worker larval pheromone in a previous study [\\[12\\]](#page-13-6). (*Z*)-β-Ocimene and α-terpineol have not been reported as honeybee volatiles, but they have been indicated as pheromones in other insects. (*Z*)-β-Ocimene could be released by calling males of the Caribbean fruit fly (*Anastrepha suspensa*) [\\[15\\]](#page-13-9); α-Terpineol is reported as a compound of the male-produced aggregation pheromone secreted by the spined soldier bug (SSB) *Podisus maculiventris* [\\[16\\]](#page-13-10). (*Z*)-β-ocimene, (*E*)-β-ocimene and (*E*, *Z*)-alloocimene were once reported as the components of *Tagetes minuta* essential oil, which is highly lethal to *V. destructor* [\\[17\\]](#page-13-11). α-Terpineol was demonstrated to have a repellent effect on the mite in a laboratory assay, and may therefore repress its entry into the brood cells of hives [\\[18\\]](#page-13-12). These terpenoids might be noteworthy in *V. destructor* control. There are sesquiterpenes identified as pheromones. (*E*)-b-Farnenese is an aphid alarm pheromone [\\[19\\]](#page-13-13). In this study, cedrol is a tentatively identified sesquiterpene with tertiary alcohol functionality. This alcohol could easily eliminate to give mixtures of α- and β-cedrene, these sesquiterpenes might be gathered by bees from gum and pollen of *Cedrus deodara* planted nearby the apiary. All aldehydes detected in this study have been previously reported as the pheromone from calling males of *Galleria mellonella* [\\[20\\]](#page-13-14) and the volatiles of hives. The aldehydes are emitted by adult worker bees [\\[21\\]](#page-13-15) and virgin queens [\\[22\\]](#page-13-16) and are present in enclosed brood combs containing active larvae and attending workers [\\[1\\]](#page-12-0). Our results found that aldehyde content per unit weight was higher in larval food than in larvae. This supports the assumption that aldehydes are secreted by worker bees, because larval food is a material that is manipulated by worker bees. This is consistent with the findings of Torto et al. [\\[23\\]](#page-13-17) who reported these aldehydes in pollen. The result also explains why aldehyde contents in food did not show significant fluctuations during larval development. Aldehyde contents in larvae also remained steady, regardless of larval growth, except that a1 disappeared after the 2nd instar. Hydrocarbons have transpiration-reducing functions in arthropods. They include linear and branched, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, with different numbers of carbon atoms ranging from 15 to 35 [\\[24\\]](#page-13-18). Some of these compounds function in nestmate recognition and social acceptance [\\[25\\]](#page-13-19). Pentadecane has been reported as a larval volatile [\\[26\\]](#page-14-0). It was detected in nurse bees [\\[27\\]](#page-14-1) and queens at liftoff [\\[28\\]](#page-14-2), coupled with heptadecane. Octadecane is found in comb wax, with worker bees treated with this compound becoming less acceptable to their untreated nestmates [\\[29\\]](#page-14-3). It is released by the clearwing moth (*Paranthrene diaphana*) as female sex pheromone [\\[30\\]](#page-14-4). If we assume that cuticular hydrocarbons have an even and constant distribution on the surface of larvae, hydrocarbon content should increase with larval volume. A previous report has indicated that the level of tricosane and pentacosane would increase with drone larval development [\\[31\\]](#page-14-5). In the present study, hydrocarbon content increased at different degrees in individual larvae during larval development. To some extent, this provides another support for the hypothesis. In food, the hydrocarbon content showed different degrees of decrease in per unit weight. This suggests that the production of hydrocarbons in food is independent from that in larvae. In other words, hydrocarbons in food are affected by the food provider, while hydrocarbons in larvae are affected by the larvae themselves. Aliphatic esters are known as another group of pheromones secreted by insects. For example, ethyl acetate is a male pheromone produced by the Mediterranean fruit fly (*Ceratitis capitate)* [\\[32\\]](#page-14-6). Acetate and propionate esters are found in the poison gland reservoir of *Myrmecina graminicola* [\\[33\\]](#page-14-7). In honeybee colonies, aliphatic ester is also ubiquitous. Decyl decanoate is secreted by virgin queens from the tergal gland; ethyl oleate is produced by forager bees, suppressing the onset of foraging among younger bees. Ethyl and methyl esters of palmitic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, and oleic acids are brood pheromones mediating the communication between brood and worker bees [\\[14\\]](#page-13-8). Ethyl 2(*E*)-decenoate is tentatively identified in honeybees for the first time in the present study. Ethyl 2(*E*)-decenoate was once tentatively identified as one of the major compounds from fermented sugar baits for lepidopteran species resulting from sugar decomposition during the fermentation process [\\[34\\]](#page-14-8). (*E*)-Geranylacetone has been previously identified as a queen volatile [\\[28\\]](#page-14-2), a male-produced sex pheromone of cerambycid beetle (*Hedypathes betulinus*) [\\[35\\]](#page-14-9) and a male-produced aggregation pheromone of the brown spruce longhorn beetle (*Tetropium fuscum*) [\\[36\\]](#page-14-10). Concentrations of this compound in larvae did not show obvious changes with the growth of individual larvae, and the concentrations only displayed a dramatic increase during the capping stage (the 5th instar). No significant differences in the concentrations of this compound were found in food at different stages, either. This may suggest that the compound is released by larvae for a specific role in this particular period. When tracing the origins of the volatiles of worker larvae and larval food, the following factors need to be considered in the future: the volatiles of the adult worker bees, the in-hive matrix (such as honey, pollen, propolis and wax), and even the out-hive plants published by other studies based on the same locality. Moreover, the constancy of volatile components in worker larvae samples from different localities should be established. Additionally, more qualitative analysis should be conducted to the tentatively identified volatiles. Finally, only a single extraction method was applied in this study, and the use of more advanced extraction or detection methods for worker larvae volatiles might yield additional compounds. ']","['**5. conclusions** Our results show that volatiles could be identified from honeybee worker larvae and their food, in addition to (*E*)-β-ocimene. We provide evidence that these volatiles change and follow certain change rule during larval development. The present study should provide some basis for further research into the molecular mechanism of the volatiles, and for verification of the role of the identified components. **Supplementary Materials:** The following are available online at http://[www.mdpi.com](http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/10/4/118/s1)/2075-4450/10/4/118/s1, Table S1: Linearity of response for standards. **Author Contributions:** H.Z., C.H. and Q.D. conceived and designed the experiments; H.Z. performed the experiments; H.Z. analyzed the data; Y.L., Y.W., Y.P. and Q.D. contributed reagents, materials, and analysis tools; H.Z. and C.H. wrote the manuscript.

Induces Triple NegativeBreast Cancer Cells Apoptosis through Oxidative Stress Pathway.,"Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are associated with poor patient survivalbecause of the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), andhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressions. Our previous studieshave shown that the triterpenoid saponin AG8 from Ardisia gigantifolia stapf.inhibits the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. In this study, the effects of AG8were further analyzed in different TNBC cell types: MDA-MB-231, BT-549, andMDA-MB-157 cells. AG8 inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231, BT-549, andMDA-MB-157 cells in a dose-dependent manner and showed stronger cytotoxicity toAfrican American (AA) and mesenchymal (M) subtypes than Caucasian (CA) andmesenchymal stem-like (MSL) subtypes, respectively. AG8 impaired the uptake ofMitoTracker Red CMXRos by the mitochondria of TNBC cells in a dose-dependentmanner, and this was recovered by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). AG8 affected GSH,SOD, and MDA levels of TNBC cells, but different TNBC subtypes had differentsensitivities to AG8 and NAC. In addition, we found that AG8 increased theBax/Bcl-2 ratio and the levels of cytoplasmic cytochrome c and significantlydecreased phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells. AG8elicited its anticancer effects through ROS generation, ERK and AKT activation,and by triggering mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in TNBC cells. AG8 hadselective cytotoxic effects against the AA and M TNBC subtypes and markedlyinduced MDA-MB-157 (AA subtype) cell apoptosis through pathways that were notassociated with ROS, which was different from the other two subtypes. Theunderlying mechanisms should be further investigated.","Mu, Li-Hua, Wang, Li-Hua, Yu, Teng-Fei, Wang, Yu-Ning, Yan, Hong, Liu, Ping, Yan, Can",2020,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2,False,False,True,"Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) lack estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression and account for approximately 15-25% of total breast cancer cases. TNBCs are highly recurrent and metastatic with poor prognosis and often occur in young patients. Common hormone therapy or targeted therapies are inefficient for TNBCs because of the deficiencies in necessary receptors, and therefore, combination chemotherapy treatments are usually given to TNBC patients; however, drug resistance and adverse side effects occur frequently. TNBC is a very heterogeneous disease with at least six molecular subtypes: immunomodulatory (IM), mesenchymal (M), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), basal-like 1 and 2 (BL1 and BL2), and luminal androgen receptor (LAR). TNBC can also be divided according to race into African American (AA) type and Caucasian (CA) type. These TNBC subtypes have different responses to standard of care (SOC) treatments, because each of them has its own unique ontology. Since most currently available therapies cannot benefit TNBCs, therapeutic agents with minimal toxicities and better efficacy need to be developed.According to our previous studies, triterpenoid saponins from Ardisia gigantifolia stapf. showed cytotoxic activities towards several kinds of cancer cells. Some of the triterpenoid saponins showed prominent cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells. Among them, triterpenoid saponin AG8 isolated from A. gigantifolia stapf. inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. In this study, AG8 was selected for further analysis on different TNBC cell types including MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157. This study is aimed at investigating the effects of AG8 on the oxidative stress pathway and cell death induction in TNBC cells.","AG8 (Figure 1(a), purity: >95%) was isolated from A. gigantifolia stapf. as previously described. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).The TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and BT-549 were purchased from Cell Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in L-15 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin with 5% CO2 at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere. BT-549 cells were grown in DMEM medium (Gibco) containing 20% FBS at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.The effects of AG8 on cell viability were evaluated using the MTT assay. To this end, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and BT-549 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of AG8 for 24 h. Then, the cells were incubated with MTT solution for 4 h, the supernatant was aspirated, and the formazan crystals were dissolved using DMSO. Finally, the cell viability was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer, Inc., 1420-012, Shanghai, China). The antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC; Sigma, # A7250) in PBS (final concentration 4 mM) was added to the cells for 1 h before the addition of AG8, and then, the cells were cultured with NAC and AG8 for 24 h before assaying for cell viability.For the assessment of proliferation, cells were seeded into 6-cm culture dishes and counted after 24 h and treated by different concentrations of AG8 for 24 h and replaced with regular culture to continuously incubate for 14 days. Colonies were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Then, colonies were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 10 min and counted.Apoptosis of TNBC cells was examined using Annexin V-FITC and PI double staining. The cells were treated with different concentrations of AG8 for 24 h: MDA-MB-231 cells with 0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 μM AG8; MDA-MB-157 with 0, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 μM AG8; and BT-549 cells with 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 μM AG8. Then, the cells were collected, washed with PBS, and stained by Annexin V-FITC kit (Keygen, Jiangsu, China). Cell apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry (FACS Calibur; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). NAC (4 mM) was added to the TNBC cells 1 h before treatment with AG8, and then, the cells were cultured with NAC and AG8 for 24 h before the measurement of cell apoptosis.MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and BT-549 cells were incubated with different concentrations of AG8 for 24 h, and then, 100 nM MitoTracker Red CMXRos was added to the cells (Keygen, Jiangsu, China). After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the cells were observed by using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60, Tokyo, Japan). NAC (4 mM) was added to the TNBC cells 1 h before AG8 treatment, and then, the cells were cultured with NAC and AG8 for 24 h before the measurement of mitochondria activity.Intracellular ROS was estimated using the fluorescent probe, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Briefly, the cells were treated with different concentrations of AG8 with or without NAC (4 mM) for 24 h. MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and BT-549 cells (0.5 × 105 cells/ml) were then incubated in a culture medium containing 10 μM DCFH-DA for 20 min at 37°C. Following incubation, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS for ROS accumulation measurement using flow cytometry.After treatment with AG8 for 24 h, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in MDA-MB-231 cells (AG8: 0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 μM), MDA-MB-157(AG8: 0, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 μM), and BT-549 cells (AG8: 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 μM) were analyzed using the SOD WST-1 assay kit, GSH assay kit, and MDA assay kit from Nanjing Jiancheng Bio-Engineering Institute (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, #A001-3, #A006-2 and #A003-4) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NAC (final concentration 4 mM) was added to the TNBC cells 1 h before AG8 treatment, and then, the cells were cultured with NAC and AG8 for 24 h before the measurement of cell apoptosis.BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells were treated with different concentrations of AG8 (1.0 and 1.5 μM) with or without NAC (4 mM) for 24 h. The TNBC cells were collected and lysed in total protein extraction reagent with proteinase inhibitors. The protein concentrations were measured by the BCA protein assay kit. Protein samples from treated TNBC cells were separated by SDS–PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membranes, which were washed and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 1 h at 25°C. Subsequently, the membranes were washed and incubated with indicated primary antibodies against cleaved-caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome C, AKT, pAKT, ERK, and pERK (Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA) at 4°C overnight and further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at 25°C for 1 h. The load protein bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescent detection reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).All data were presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) from three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Statistical comparisons were evaluated using Student's t-test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.","To determine whether AG8 differentially affects TNBC cell proliferation, its effects on MDA-MB-231 (MSL, CA), BT-549 (M, CA), and MDA-MB-157 (MSL, AA) were investigated. As shown in Figure 1(b), AG8 inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the IC50 values were 3.80, 0.73, and 1.38 μM, respectively. AG8 showed stronger cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-157 than MDA-MB-231cells, indicating that the AA may be more sensitive to AG8 than CA TNBC cell lines. MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 are CA type TNBCs; AG8 showed increased cytotoxicity to BT-549 (IC50 0.73 μM) compared to MDA-MB-231(IC50 3.80 μM), which means AG8 could have more effects on M subtypes than on MSL subtypes.To determine the effects of AG8 on cell apoptosis, the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells were treated with AG8 for 24 h and double stained with annexin-V/PI in order to assay for apoptosis using flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 1(c), after treatment with 0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 μM AG8 for 24 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells in MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells was increased significantly. Incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells with high doses of AG8 resulted in higher levels of apoptosis than H2O2 which was used as positive control. These results indicated that AG8 could reduce cell viability by increasing the number of early or late apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner. The colony formation assay indicated that AG8 decreases the percentage of colonies in a dose-dependent manner, but this effect was lower than that of H2O2 (Figures 1(d) and 1(e)). Taken together, all the above results indicated that AG8 inhibited TNBC cell proliferation and caused apoptosis in vitro.To examine the effects of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) on the viability of AG8-treated TNBC cells, MDA-MB-231(AG8, 4.0 μM), BT-549 (AG8, 1.0 μM), and MDA-MB-157(AG8, 1.5 μM) cells were pretreated with NAC (4 mM) prior to 24 h incubation with AG8. As shown in Figure 2, NAC alone had no effect on the viability of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells, while increased the viability of MDA-MB-157 cells. Following treatment with AG8, viability of MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells was dramatically decreased to 40.3%, 65.3%, and 50.3%, respectively, and in the AG8+NAC group, cell viability was significantly increased to 89.3%, 93.6%, and 72.6%, respectively. These results suggested that NAC could significantly counteract the negative effects of AG8 on TNBC cell viability (Figure 2).It is known that mitochondria dysfunction is one of the many causes of apoptosis. Thus, we examined the effects of AG8 on the mitochondria activity of TNBC cells using MitoTracker Red CMXRos dye. Before the treatment with AG8, MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells had many bright red, dot-like fluorescence structures in the cytoplasm of cells (Figure 3(a)). After AG8 treatment for 24 h; the red fluorescence in the cytoplasm was decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner suggesting that AG8 impaired MitoTracker Red CMXRos uptake by mitochondria. In the AG8+NAC group, the red fluorescence increased dramatically compared to the AG8-alone group at the same concentration (Figure 3(a)). These results clearly demonstrated that the severely impaired function of the mitochondria following treatment with AG8 can be recovered by treating TNBC cells with NAC. Oxidative reactions in mitochondria result in the ROS generation, which are converted to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase. As shown in Figure 3(b), AG8 significantly increased the levels of intracellular ROS in the three TNBC cells compared to the control group, and the antioxidant NAC significantly decreased the levels of intracellular ROS. Upon pretreatment with NAC, the AG8-mediated ROS was significantly inhibited. In MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells, AG8 even showed better activity than the positive control H2O2.To determine the potential effects of AG8 on oxidative stress, the levels of GSH, SOD, and MDA in TNBC cells treated with or without AG8 were further measured. As shown in Figure 4, after incubation with AG8 for 24 h, the levels of GSH and SOD in MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells were decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and the levels of MDA were increased in dose-dependent manner. The effects of antioxidant NAC on the GSH, SOD, and MDA levels of AG8-treated TNBC cells were also examined. In MDA-MB-157 cells, the levels of GSH and SOD in the AG8+NAC group (1.5 μM + 4 mM) were increased, and the MDA levels were decreased significantly compared with those in the AG8-alone group at the same concentration. Regarding MDA-MB-231 cells, NAC showed no significant effects on GSH levels, but the SOD and MDA levels were increased and decreased compared with the AG8-alone group at the same concentration, respectively. In BT-549 cells, compared with the 1.0 μM AG8 group, NAC showed significant effects only on MDA levels. In summary, AG8 showed cytotoxicity against TNBC cells by affecting the levels of GSH, SOD, and MDA that are associated with oxidative stress pathway, but different TNBC subtypes had different sensitivities to AG8 and NAC.After treated with AG8, NAC, or AG8+NAC for 24 h, the expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, and cytochrome c proteins in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells were assayed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 5(a) in BT549, AG8 significantly increased cytochrome c expression, and this effect was counteracted by NAC. However, in MDA-MB-157 cells (AA subtype), AG8 only slightly increased the release of cytochrome c, and NAC also showed a weak effect on this increase (Figures 5(a) and 5(c)). In both BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells, AG8 significantly increased and decreased the expression of Bax and Bcl-2, respectively, and NAC rescued their levels. For both TNBC cells, AG8 treatment increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio significantly (Figure 5(b)), suggesting that the Bcl-2 family of proteins is involved in AG8-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. AG8 significantly increased the expression levels of caspase-3 in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells, and pretreatment with NAC apparently blocked this effect (Figure 5(d)). These findings suggest that AG8 could induce apoptosis of BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells through the mitochondria-dependent pathway.We examined the modulatory effects of AG8 on pAKT and pERK in TNBC cells and found that after 24 h of AG8 treatment, the expression of pAKT and pERK in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells decreased significantly (Figure 6(a)). In BT549, pretreatment with (4 mM NAC) prior to AG8 treatment, significantly restored the levels of pAKT and pERK, was restored compared with those in the AG8 group (Figure 6(b)). In MDA-MB-157 cells, NAC restored the AG8-induced decrease in pERK without affecting the decrease in pAKT (Figure 6(b)). These findings demonstrated that AG8-induced ROS production may activate MAPK and AKT activation and triggers mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in TNBC cells.","Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) account for 12–20% of all diagnosed breast cancers and have poor overall patient survival. The treatment options for TBNC are limited to surgery, radiation, or conventional chemotherapy because few targeted therapies are available. TNBC is a very heterogeneous disease and can be divided into different molecular subtypes: immunomodulatory (IM), mesenchymal (M), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), basal-like 1 and 2 (BL1 and BL2), and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) or African American (AA) type and Caucasian (CA) type. Each TNBC subtype has its own unique ontology and responds differently to standard of care (SOC) treatments. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effects of AG8, a natural triterpenoid saponin from Ardisia gigantifolia stapf., on different TNBC subtypes, namely, MDA-MB-231 (MSL, CA), BT-549 (M, CA), and MDA-MB-157 (MSL, AA).Apoptosis is a kind of cell death that is genetically controlled, and apoptosis induction is explored as a therapeutic approach for cancer. We found that, regarding MSL TNBC cell lines, AG8 showed stronger cytotoxicity to the AA subtype (MDA-MB-157) than CA (MDA-MB-231). For CA type TNBCs, AG8 showed much more cytotoxicity to M subtypes (BT-549) than to MSL subtype (MDA-MB-231). These results indicating that AG8 may have selective cytotoxicity against AA and M TNBC subtypes need to be confirmed in future studies. Furthermore, our results indicated that the number of early or late apoptotic cells was dose-dependently increased by AG8.ROS contain unpaired electrons and are generated by partial oxygen reduction. Overproduction of ROS can further cause instability of lipids, proteins, and DNA. ROS accumulation is more harmful to cancer cells because the levels of oxidative stress in cancer cells are higher than that in normal cells. Some triterpenoid saponins have been reported to induce apoptosis via ROS accumulation in cancer cells. Therefore, antioxidants (NAC) are often used to promote oxygen reduction. Strikingly, pretreatment with NAC reduced the AG8-induced cytotoxicity, demonstrating that the production of ROS had a role in AG8-induced TNBC cells' apoptosis. In the CA subtype of TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549), cellular activities were recovered similar to those of the DMSO group, while in cells pretreated with NAC, the cellular activity was still significantly decreased compared with that of the DMSO group. These results suggest that AG8 may induce AA subtype TNBC cell apoptosis through not only ROS pathways.Mitochondrial depolarization is one of the major causes of mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial dysfunction is critical for cell apoptosis. Impairment of mitochondria membrane integrity will cause depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and finally mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. The integrity was examined using MitoTracker Red CMXRos dye. Treatment of cells with AG8 resulted in a dose-dependent damage of the mitochondria membrane, and this effect was reversed by NAC in TNBC cells.Cellular redox homeostasis is maintained by the balance between antioxidants and prooxidants. Intracellular SOD and GSH are critical antioxidants that protect the cellular components from oxidative damages. While it is produced under oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, MDA can reflect oxidative damage to the plasma membrane. To further evaluate the effects of AG8 on oxidative stress, we analyzed for the levels of these important cellular antioxidative and prooxidative enzymes in AG8 stimulated TNBC cells. We found that AG8 could significantly decrease the levels of antioxidants SOD and GSH, suggesting that it may initiate redox imbalance in TNBC cells and subsequently induce apoptosis. Our study showed that AG8 significantly increased the levels of the prooxidative enzyme MDA in TNBC cells. It was demonstrated that AG8 might be an appropriate candidate for TNBC treatment because it induces oxidative stress.Bax and Bcl-2 play crucial roles in cell apoptosis. The mitochondria could initiate an apoptotic cell death pathway through cytochrome c release. The balance of pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family determines the ultimate apoptosis/survival fate of cells. When the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is increased, the mitochondrial membrane potential is lost, cytochrome c is released, and subsequently, caspase-9 is activated, resulting in the activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 can lead to cell death characterized by cell membrane blebbing, destruction of cell structure, and DNA fragmentation. In AG8-treated BT-549 and MDA-MB-157 cells, the expressions of Bax and Bcl-2 were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, and the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was significantly reduced by NAC treatment. AG8 could induce cytochrome c release from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, and this effect was also counteracted by NAC. This indicated that AG8-induced apoptosis occurs possibly via the mitochondrial pathway.The AKT and MAPK signaling pathways are critical pathways involved in the regulation of processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Phosphorylated AKT and/or ERK can increase cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. ROS have been reported to induce apoptosis of tumor cells by activating caspases, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. The activation of AKT and/or ERK may be a key mechanism for cancer treatment. In addition, AKT may regulate cell apoptosis through modulation of Bcl-2 family members. Therefore, we investigated the cellular signaling pathways involved in AG8-induced apoptosis. We found that AG8 significantly decreased phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells. NAC could significantly restore the levels of phosphorylated ERK in both two cells, while it only reversed the dramatic decrease in pAKT levels in BT549 cells and had no effects on the decrease of pAKT in MDA-MB-157 cells. These results indicated that ROS may have little effects on the AG8-induced decease of pAKT in MDA-MB-157 (AA subtype), and these different reactions between different subtypes need to be further examined. Therefore, AG8 may interfere with ERK and AKT pathways and triggers mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells.","Although the mechanisms and therapeutic effects of AG8 on TNBC need to be further investigated, the present results indicated that AG8 showed anticancer effects by inducing ROS, inhibiting ERK and Akt signaling pathways, and direct impairing the function of mitochondria. In addition, we found that different TNBC subtypes showed different sensitivities to AG8, and therefore, AG8 may have selective cytotoxic effects against AA and M TNBC subtypes. It is interesting that AG8 dramatically induced MDA-MB-157 (AA subtype) cell apoptosis through pathways not only associated with ROS, in contrast to the other two subtypes. The mechanisms of the effects of AG8 need to be further examined."

Adult male mice were administeredCon A (15 mg/kg, intravenously) for 8 h. In the treated groups, mice werepretreated with escin daily (10 mg/kg in CMC, orally) for 4 days before Con Aintoxication. In addition, escin was administered in a group to examine itseffect on normal mice. Our results showed that escin inhibited Con A-inducedelevation in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and LDH) and curbed the Con A-inducedhepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis together with abrogating the death pathway,JNK. Coincidentally, escin has shown a reduction in neutrophil, CD4+ T cell, andmonocyte infiltration into the liver. In addition, escin modulated the cellularoxidant status by compensating for the Con A-depleted expression of thetranscription factor Nrf2 and the stress protein hemeoxygenase-1. These effectswere in good agreement with the restraining effect of escin on Con A-instigatedoverexpression of NF-κB and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A.Interestingly, Con A provoked the cellular protective pathway IL-22/STAT3, whichwas revoked by the escin pretreatment. In conclusion, escin shows extendedantioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinecrotic, and anti-apoptotic effects againstCon A-induced immune-mediated hepatitis. These effects may collectively be viasuppressing immune cell infiltration into the liver and selective modulation ofNrf2/HO-1, TNF-α/NF-κB, TNF-α/JNK, and IL-22/STAT3 signaling pathways.","Elshal, Mahmoud, Hazem, Sara H",2022,Inflammopharmacology,2,False,False,True,"Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive inflammation of the liver with an underestimated prevalence and unsatisfiable complete remission therapeutic output (Francque et al.). Experimental discovery of new agents to manage immune-mediated hepatitis, including AIH, viral hepatitis, and iatrogenic immune-mediated hepatotoxicity, has been hindered by relatively limited animal models (Heymann et al.). Concanavalin A (Con A) is a sugar-binding legume lectin that is extracted from the jack beans, Canavalia brasiliensis. It has a key role in drug development for human AIH, as it induces a model of acute immune-mediated hepatitis characterized by specific target organ toxicity, T cell-mediated liver disease due to its T lymphocyte mitogenic ability, and clinical resemblance (Sharma et al.).Con A-induced liver damage arises from the activation and recruitment of T lymphocytes to the liver. It was shown that after Con A intravenous injection, T lymphocytes assemble in the hepatic sinusoids and proliferate into CD4+ cells (Hazem et al.). These T helper cells subsequently overproduce various inflammatory mediators causing the so-called cytokine storm. In addition, CD4+ T cells recognize the MHC of resident macrophages, resulting in overproduction of the main pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α (Shaker et al.). Besides, Con A can induce hepatocellular apoptosis by both a caspase dependent pathway and a mitochondrial pathway (Liu et al.).Beta-escin (Escin) is the active constituent of a natural mixture of triterpene saponin glycoside derived from the horse chestnut, Aesculus hippocastanum (Berti et al.). Escin has been shown to have multiple pharmacodynamic effects including anti-edematous, anti-inflammatory, venotonic, and free radical scavenging effects (Ottillinger and Greeske). Currently, escin is therapeutically indicated for chronic venous insufficiency, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, hematoma, venous congestion, diabetic retinopathy, and postoperative edema. On the other hand, recent studies has shown its promising efficacy in multiple models of inflammation including a high fat diet (Avci et al.), mouse paw edema (Matsuda et al.), neuronal ischemia reperfusion injury (Gao et al.), and rat pleuritis models (Yang et al.). Yet, it is not fully investigated whether escin may have a protective effect on Con A-induced AIH or not, and if so, its underlying mechanisms. Accordingly, our current study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of escin on this type of hepatitis and elucidate its possible underlying mechanisms.","Adult male BALB/c mice (25–30 g) were supplied from Vacsera (Giza, Egypt) and maintained in a controlled setting with tap water and food ad libitum. Animal handling and experiments were reviewed and approved by the research ethics committee of Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt (Code number: 2022-46).Escin, Con A, N-methyl-2-phenylindole, 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid), and vanadium trichloride were supplied from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). N-(1-Naphthyl)-ethylenediaminedihydrochloride, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), Tris, acrylamide:bisacrylamide (29:1) 40% solution, sodium dodecyl sulfate, ammonium persulfate, and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine were purchased from Fisher Chemical (Leicestershire, UK). Bovine serum albumen (BSA) and Tween 20 were purchased from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA, USA). All other chemicals were of the highest analytical grade available.Mice were randomly divided into four groups (6 each): Group I (Control): animals were administered escin vehicle [CMC (0.5%) orally for 4 days] and Con A vehicle [normal saline (0.9%) intravenously (i.v.) in the tail vein 8h] before killing. Group II (Con A): animals received Con A (20 mg/kg) i.v. in the tail vein as 0.2% w/v solution in normal saline (0.9%) for 8h. Group III (escin): animals received escin (10 mg/kg/day) orally for 4 days as 0.1% w/v solution in 0.5% CMC in addition to Con A vehicle as described in Group I. Group IV (Escin+Con A): animals received escin, as described in group III, and Con A, as described in group II, 2h after the last escin dose.The dose of Con A was chosen based on our preliminary studies and previous mouse studies (Trautwein et al.; Streetz et al.) using Con A. The escin dose was also determined based on previous studies (Du et al.; Zhang et al.) and our pilot study demonstrated that the 10 mg/kg dose achieved the maximum hepatoprotection without induction of liver dysfunction when administered alone.Eight hours after Con A injection, mice were anesthetized by thiopental sodium (70 mg/kg, i.p) (Elshal et al.). For hepatic histological and immunohistochemical evaluations, the right median lobe was isolated and fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin in normal saline. To isolate serum samples, cardiac blood was collected via puncturing and centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min (at 4 ℃). Samples of liver homogenate were prepared by homogenizing a portion from the left median lobe of the liver in 20 mM Tris–HCl (containing 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), followed by centrifugation at 3000g for 20 min (at 4 ℃) and collection of supernatants. Serum and homogenate samples were stored at − 80 °C for subsequent analysis. Another portion from the left median lobe was kept and stored at − 80 °C for western blot analysis.Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were measured in serum as hepatocellular injury biomarkers by biochemical kits (Spectrum Diagnostics, Egypt).Fixed and paraffinized liver sections (5 μm thick) were dewaxed in xylene, mounted on slides, and stained with hematoxylin–eosin (H&E). The slides were then examined for necroinflammation and immune cell infiltration according to the criteria of the histological activity index (HAI) (Ishak et al.). The scoring of necroinflammation was determined as the summation of: 0–4 for periportal or periseptal interface hepatitis; 0–6 for confluent necrosis; 0–4 for focal inflammation, focal necrosis, and apoptosis; 0–4 for portal inflammation. An average neutrophil count was determined for each group via counting ten fields with the highest aggregates of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with segmented nuclei (Elshal et al.).Additionally, immunohistochemical expression level of the neutrophil marker Ly6G in liver was evaluated via immunostaining by the avidin–biotin complex method (Guesdon et al.) using anti-mouse Ly6G antibody (Cat. No: 127602; BioLegend, CA, USA) based on the manufacturer’s guidance.Similarly, CD4+ T cell and monocyte infiltration in liver was also evaluated by immunohistochemical determination of the expression levels of the CD4+ T cells and macrophage marker F4/80 via immunostaining using mouse monoclonal CD4+ T cell antibody (M7310; Dako, Denmark) and anti-mouse F4/80 antibody (Cat. No: 123102; BioLegend, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Semi-quantitative scoring of positively immunostained samples was assigned as follows: 0 for < 5%, 1+ for 6–24%, 2+ for 25–49%, 3+ for 50–74%, and 4+ for 75–100% positively stained cells (Wang et al.).Hepatocyte apoptosis was determined by examining the pro-apoptotic markers Bax and active caspase-3 via immunostaining by the avidin–biotin complex method (Guesdon et al.) using anti-Bax and anti-cleaved caspase-3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cat. No: A12009; ABclonal, MA, USA and GB11532; Servicebio, Gent, Belgium, respectively) according to the manufacturer instructions.To estimate the extent of lipid peroxidation, hepatic MDA content was specifically measured using the hydrochloric acid-based medium assay previously described by Gérard-Monnier et al..Total nitrate/nitrite (NOx) content in the liver were determined as indicators for the nitric oxide synthesis pathway, using vanadium (III) to reduce nitrate and the Griess reaction as mentioned formerly (Miranda et al.).Hepatic Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions were determined immunohistochemically via the avidin–biotin complex method (Guesdon et al.) using the anti-Nrf2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cat. No: GB113808; Servicebio, Gent, Belgium) and anti-HO-1 mouse monoclonal antibody (Cat. No: sc-136960; Santa Cruz, Texas, USA) as directed by the manufacturers.Hepatic NF-κB p65 expression was determined via immunostaining by the avidin–biotin complex method (Guesdon et al.) using the anti-NF-κB p65 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cat. No: bs-20159R; Bioss Antibodies, MA, USA) as directed by the manufacturer.The concentrations TNF-α, IL-17A, and IL-22 were measured by the ELISA MAX™ Deluxe set (BioLegend, SanDiego, CA, USA) in the liver tissue lysates and sera. To prepare liver lysate samples, liver portions (10%) were homogenized in cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 Mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplied with an appropriate amount of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set 1 (Calbiochem, USA). Thereafter, centrifugation of samples at 7000g for 10 min at 4 °C was carried out for isolating the supernatants to load in the 96-well plate for ELISA.Portions of liver weighing 20 mg were lysed in a cold buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) supplied with the protease inhibitor cocktail. To eliminate cell debris, samples were sonicated and incubated for 30 min on ice before being centrifuged at 10,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford assay (Miranda et al.). Slab gel (10%) was applied according to Roy and Kumar (2014). After gel polymerization, equivalent sample concentrations (30 µg protein/sample) were loaded in the wells of sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresis was done at 125 V for about 2 h. Gel was stained by 0.1% Coomassie blue R-250 for 2 h and then a solution of glacial acetic acid, methanol, and water (1:3:6, respectively) was used for distaining. Then, the separated proteins were transferred under electric current to a nylon membrane (GE Healthcare). The blotted membrane was then incubated in blocking solution for 1h at room temperature, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with a solution encompassing either anti-beta actin mouse monoclonal antibody (Cat. No: mAbcam8224; abcam, MA, USA), anti-JNK1 (phospho-T183) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/1000) (Cat. No: ab47337; abcam, MA, USA), or anti-phospho-STAT3 mouse monoclonal antibody (1/1000) (Cat. No: sc-8059, Santa Cruz, Texas, USA]. After three cycles of 5 min wash, the membrane was incubated with a solution containing the appropriate concentration of the secondary antibody for 1h at 25 °C. The chemiluminescence detection was used to identify the antibody-bound protein bands, and the Totallab analysis software (Ver.1.0.1) was used for densitometry analysis (Geldoc-it, UVP, England).The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, followed by Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison test as post hoc test and expressed as mean ± SE (n = 6). Kruskal–Wallis by rank and the Dunn’s multiple comparison post hoc tests were used to analyze the scores of necroinflammation and immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis and graphing were performed by GraphPad Prism V8.01 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA).","Hepatocellular injury after 8h from Con A injection was evidenced by a significant increase in ALT (p < 0.01), AST (p < 0.001), and LDH (p < 0.001) serum activities in comparison with the normal mice group (Fig. 1a–c, respectively). However, administration of escin (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A significantly decreased the peak activities of ALT (p < 0.01), AST (p < 0.001), and LDH (p < 0.001) compared to Con A alone. Alternatively, escin alone did not affect serum ALT, AST, or LDH activities.As shown in Fig. 2a, liver sections from the Con A group stained with H&E showed marked necroinflammatory changes characterized by severe periportal and portal lymphohistiocytic infiltration, heavy neutrophils aggregation, and large area of necrosis in comparison with the normal hepatic histology in both the control group and the group that received escin only. However, these hepatic pathological abnormalities were markedly ameliorated upon administration of escin (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A.These results were further illustrated by semi-quantitative scoring of necroinflammation (Fig. 2b) and counting of infiltrated neutrophils (Fig. 2c). Both the hepatic necroinflammation score and the average neutrophil count were significantly (p < 0.001) greater in the Con A group than in the control counterpart, and escin administration before Con A significantly (p < 0.01 and 0.001, respectively) reduced both of them. Alternatively, escin alone had no effect on hepatic necroinflammation score or infiltrated neutrophil count.To confirm whether escin can limit Con A-instigated neutrophil infiltration in the liver, the hepatic expression of Ly6G positive cells was immunohistochemically assessed (Fig. 3a). Liver sections from the Con A group showed marked expression of Ly6G-positive cells that were negatively expressed in the control and escin groups. However, escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A markedly limited Con A-induced elevation in Ly6G-positive cell. According to semi-quantitative scoring, Ly6G expression was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the mice livers that received Con A alone in comparison to those of the normal mice. Meanwhile, hepatic Ly6G expression was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the (Escin+Con A) group compared to the Con A group (Fig. 3b).Next, CD4+ T cell infiltration in liver was evaluated by immunohistochemical assessment of its expression (Fig. 4a). Liver sections from the Con A group showed remarkably higher percentage of CD4+ T cells positive expression than those from the control group and Escin groups. Notably, upon escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A, infiltration of CD4+ T cells in the liver was strongly suppressed. Semi-quantitative scoring revealed that Con A-induced infiltration of CD4+ T cells was significant (p < 0.01) compared to the control group and that escin administration before Con A significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed this infiltration (Fig. 4b).Moreover, monocyte infiltration in the liver was evaluated by assessment of immunohistochemical expression of F4/80-positive cells (Fig. 5a). Liver sections from the control and escin groups showed negative F4/80-positive cells, while those from the Con A group showed marked expression of these cells. Conversely, escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A strongly suppressed monocyte infiltration as well. According to semi-quantitative scoring, F4/80 expression was markedly (p < 0.001) elevated in the Con A group in comparison with the control counterpart. Interestingly, escin treatment before Con A significantly curbed (p < 0.05) this elevation (Fig. 5b).Con A injection resulted in marked elevation in lipid peroxidation and nitrosative stress in liver as demonstrated by a significant (p < 0.001) increase in hepatic MDA and NOx contents (Fig. 6a, b, respectively) compared to the control group. Both hepatic MDA and NOx contents were significantly (p < 0.001) repressed upon the administration of escin (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A compared to Con A alone. Alternatively, escin alone had no effect on hepatic MDA or NOx contents compared to the control group. As all our previous results showed that using escin alone does not have any effect on the phenotype, we continued our study without the escin group.Trying to elucidate the underlying antioxidant mechanism of escin in this type of hepatitis, the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 was examined immunohistochemically. Our results demonstrated that liver sections from the control group showed marked expression of Nrf2, but the expression was very mild in the Con A group. Interestingly, pretreatment with escin markedly increased Nrf2 expression (Fig. 7a).Next, immunostained liver sections against the antioxidant protein HO-1 were evaluated and similarly showed that HO-1 was markedly expressed in the control group, but its expression was very mild in the Con A group and upon treatment with escin, the expression was moderately increased (Fig. 7c).Semi-quantitative scoring revealed that Con A elicited a pronounced (p < 0.001) reduction in the hepatic expressions of both Nrf2 and HO-1 compared to the control group, whereas escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A caused a significant (p < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively) elevation in their expression (Fig. 7b, d, respectively).When compared to the control group, Con A injection significantly (p < 0.001) elevated hepatic and serum TNF-α levels and hepatic IL-17A level as well (Fig. 8a, b, respectively). Meanwhile, escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the elevated levels of both cytokines when compared to the Con A group.Regarding NF-κB, immunohistochemical assessment of the transcription factor NF-κB p65 activation and translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 8c) revealed that Con A markedly elevated its expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus of hepatocytes. Alternatively, escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A strongly reduced this expression. According to semi-quantitative scoring, Con A caused a significant (p < 0.001) increase in NF-κB p65 expression compared to the control group, while pretreatment with escin significantly (p < 0.05) reduced its expression (Fig. 8d).Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated JNK1 protein was evaluated by western blot. Intriguingly, the results revealed that Con A injection substantially elevated the expression of phosphorylated JNK1 protein in the liver. However, escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A limited this elevation (Fig. 8e).Regarding pro-apoptotic markers, immunostained liver sections against the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (Fig. 9a) showed negative expression in the control group; however, marked expression appeared in the Con A group. Obviously, this expression was markedly decreased in the treated group.Likewise, immunostained liver sections against the apoptotic executioner caspase-3 (Fig. 9c) showed negative expression in the control group; however, marked expression appeared in the Con A group. Obviously, this expression was markedly decreased in the treated group.Semi-quantitative scoring revealed that expressions of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase-3 (Fig. 9b, d, respectively) in the livers of the Con A-challenged mice were significantly (p < 0.01) elevated when compared with those of normal mice, but was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced upon pretreatment with escin (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days. Thus, Con A-induced apoptosis was effectively ameliorated by escin.Interestingly, hepatic and serum levels of IL-22 were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated by Con A injection compared to the control group. However, these levels were significantly (p < 0.001) reduced upon escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A in comparison to the group that received Con A alone (Fig. 10a).Next, the phosphorylated STAT3 protein was evaluated by western blot. The results revealed that Con A injection strongly elevated phosphorylated STAT3 protein expression; however, this elevated expression was diminished upon treatment with escin (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A (Fig. 10b).","The current standard treatment regimens for autoimmune hepatitis are based on immune system suppression (Czaja) with an outcome of relapse in 50–85% of adults and 60–80% of children after treatment withdrawal (Mieli-Vergani et al.), treatment failure in 9% of patients, and incomplete response in 13% of patients (Manns et al.). Such data encouraged us to dig for new strategies in the management of immune-mediated hepatitis to increase the complete remission rates.Accordingly, the main objective of our study was directed at examining the possible protective effect of escin against autoimmune hepatitis, with elucidation of the main targeted signaling pathways underlying this type of hepatitis using Con A-induced hepatitis mouse model. The results showed a significant elevation of ALT, AST, and LDH in the Con A group compared to the control group denoting liver cell injury with concomitant release of liver enzymes into the circulation. Concordantly, the histopathological examination of the H&E hepatic sections showed normal histological findings in the control group unlike the Con A group that showed marked necroinflammatory changes. The mice group that was administered escin only showed normal serum liver enzymes and normal histology denoting that escin does not possess hepatotoxic nature. On the other hand, escin pretreated group normalized the pathological changes induced by Con A.Immune cell infiltration is substantial in the development of liver injury not only by producing pro-inflammatory mediators, but also via the recruitment of other leukocytes to the hepatic tissues, and thereby augmenting the inflammatory response (Adams et al.). Neutrophils arrive at the liver as soon as 4h after Con A administration, representing the first leukocyte type to arrive at inflammation sites and, therefore, form the first line of immune defense (Bonder et al.).Our results showed that Con A intoxication resulted in heavy neutrophil aggregation in the hepatic tissue as demonstrated by histopathological examination of the H&E stain. This was also confirmed by the immunohistochemical investigation of the neutrophil marker Ly6G that showed marked expression in the hepatic sinusoids. In addition, the nitrosative stress was significantly elevated in the Con A group which can be attributed to the hepatic infiltration with neutrophils that highly express the inducible nitric oxide synthetase. Pretreating the mice with escin for 4 days was sufficient to suppress hepatic infiltration with neutrophils, as manifested by the reduction of the neutrophil infiltration, Ly6G expression and hepatic content of NOx.It has been previously reported that CD4+ T lymphocytes are the paramount stimulator of Con A-induced liver injury. Adams et al. had confirmed this by canceling the effect of CD4+ T cells, where i.v. injection of Con A was not able to develop leukocyte recruitment and hepatic inflammation (Adams et al.). Neutrophils interpose inflammatory response via recruitment other leucocytes including CD4+ T cells, where depleting neutrophils by anti-mouse antibody directed against Ly6G resulted in a marked attenuation of Con A-instigated CD4+ T lymphocyte recruitment to the liver (Tiegs et al.). Moreover, neutrophils orchestrate recruitment and differentiation of macrophages (Selders et al.).These findings were in a good agreement with our results, where the immunohistochemical analysis of CD4+ T cells and the macrophage marker F4/80 showed strong positive expression in the lectin-mediated injury group, which can be linked in part to the observed elevated neutrophil infiltration. However, the intense expression was reduced in a significant way in the escin pretreated groups. Therefore, escin not only suppressed hepatic neutrophil infiltration, but also suppressed CD4+ T cell and monocyte recruitment into the liver as well.It has been found that escin boosts endogenous antioxidant capacity via scavenging free radicals and retards oxidative degradation of lipids (Vašková et al.; Jiang et al.). This was shown by the reduction in the lipid peroxidation product MDA in the pretreated escin before Con A-challenge. In the same context, NOx of the liver assessment exhibited a marked elevation in the Con A group which was substantially lowered in the escin group. Escin directly trap NO and hinder its interaction with O2 or , thereby preventing the generation of RNOS including the highly reactive peroxynitrite (ON) (Vašková et al.).Furthermore, escin prior to Con A challenge boosted the cellular antioxidant defense mechanism as shown by the elevated expression of the Nrf2 and HO-1. Nrf2 enhances cellular antioxidant capacity by increasing the expression of genes whose protein products detoxify and eliminate ROS (Ma). Moreover, Nrf2 is a positive transcription activator of HO-1 which is an antioxidant cellular defense enzyme (Sun et al.).Collectively, escin normalized cellular oxidant status by controlling ROS and RNS levels along with boosting the cellular antioxidant capacity. Thereby, this will interfere with the inflammatory signal transduction pathways including the TNF-α pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signaling cascades. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α is chiefly produced from the activated macrophages and T lymphocytes which are highly activated in the Con A model (Balkwill). TNF-α engagement to TNFR1 is involved in activating downstream effectors and mediating programmed cell death signaling via NF-κB and stress-mediated protein kinases, JNK 1 signaling (Wajant et al.).The pro-inflammatory downstream effectors of NF-κB include activation of naïve CD4+ T cells and their differentiation into Th-17 cells which are major producers of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A, which in turn mediates monocyte and neutrophil recruitment to the site of inflammation (Liu et al.). TNF-α activates the death signaling pathway, JNK 1 that turns on the apoptotic machinery by activation of pro-apoptotic genes with the expression of death factors such as the Bax protein. In addition, JNK turns off the cell survival pathway. Finally, JNK relieves the inhibition on caspase-8 to initiate the caspase-dependent apoptosis (Weston and Davis).This vicious cycle of inflammation has been investigated in our study to elucidate the underlying mechanistic signaling of escin. The expression of the pro-inflammatory TNF-α in both serum and liver tissue was significantly elevated in the Con A group compared to the normal control, denoting the beginning of the massive inflammatory signaling in response to tissue damage. As was foreseeable, the downstream effectors of TNF-α was statistically elevated in the Con A group, where NF-κB expression was evident in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm as well as IL-17A expression in the hepatic tissue, compared to the normal control. Furthermore, western blotting of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK revealed increased expression in the lectin-induced injury group that was concordant with the apoptotic indices Bax and caspase-3. Interestingly, all these pathological inflammatory markers were crippled in a significant manner in the escin pretreated group.Although activated T cells play a well-documented role in promoting the inflammatory response, they also have a hepatoprotective role to limit the inflammatory response; otherwise the inflammation would be fatal. Evidence suggests that activated T cells produce anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic cytokines, among which is IL-22. This member of the IL-10 family acts as a cellular protective cytokine in liver injury, especially those mediated by T cells, by inducing multiple downstream effectors including STAT3 (Pickert et al.). In our study, the expression of IL-22 in both liver tissue and serum was significantly elevated in the Con A group where the T lymphocytes were simultaneously activated, confirmed by CD4+ T cell expression. However, in the escin pretreated group, where the T cells activation has been interrupted, the IL-22 expression was reduced compared to the Con A group. At the same time, western blotting of the STAT3 showed consistent results, where STAT3 expression was escalated in the Con A group, but abrogated in the Con A group pretreated with escin.","Escin could protect against Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis in mice via suppressing infiltration of neutrophils, CD4+ T cells, and monocytes into the liver, activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, inhibiting TNF-α/NF-κB, TNF-α/JNK, and IL-22/STAT3 signaling pathways. These characteristic and selective modulatory effects of escin lead to its extended antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinecrotic, and anti-apoptotic effects against this type of hepatitis (Fig. 11). Accordingly, we look forward to clinical trials to repurpose this promising natural agent as an effective, safe, and economical therapeutic option for controlling T cell-mediated hepatic disorders."
6,TA040161,10.1080/0886022X.2024.2371992,Astragaloside IV relieves passive heymann nephritis and podocyte injury bysuppressing the TRAF6/NF-κb axis.,"The pathogenesis of membranous nephropathy (MN) involves podocyte injury that isattributed to inflammatory responses induced by local immune deposits.Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is known for its robust anti-inflammatory properties.Here, we investigated the effects of AS-IV on passive Heymann nephritis (PHN)rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes to determine the underlying molecular mechanismsof MN. Serum biochemical parameters, 24-h urine protein excretion and renalhistopathology were evaluated in PHN and control rats. The expression of tumornecrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), the phosphorylation ofnuclear factor kappa B (p-NF-κB), the expression of associated proinflammatorycytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) and the ubiquitination of TRAF6 were measuredin PHN rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes. We detected a marked increase in mRNAexpression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β and in the protein abundance of p-NF-κB andTRAF6 within the renal tissues of PHN rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes.Conversely, there was a reduction in the K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6.Additionally, AS-IV was effective in ameliorating serum creatinine, proteinuria,and renal histopathology in PHN rats. This effect was concomitant with thesuppression of NF-κB pathway activation and decreased expression of TNF-α, IL-6,IL-1β and TRAF6. AS-IV decreased TRAF6 levels by promoting K48-linked ubiquitinconjugation to TRAF6, which triggered ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In summary,AS-IV averted renal impairment in PHN rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes, likely bymodulating the inflammatory response through the TRAF6/NF-κB axis. TargetingTRAF6 holds therapeutic promise for managing MN.","Ma, Yuhua, Hu, Yuwen, Ruan, Yilin, Jiang, Xiaocheng, Zhao, Min, Wang, Yuxin, Ke, Yanrong, Shi, Manman, Lu, Guoyuan",2024,Renal failure,2,False,False,True,"Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the prevailing etiology of nephrotic syndrome in adults. In recent years, the incidence of MN in our nation has increased, especially among younger individuals. Heterogeneity characterizes the treatment response and disease outcome in patients with MN. While approximately one-third of patients will experience spontaneous remission, nearly 50% of those who fail to achieve remission will eventually progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which imposes a substantial societal and familial burden.MN is an autoimmune glomerular disease, and its pathogenesis is primarily attributed to podocyte injury resulting from immune complex deposition on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The deposition of immune complexes and subsequent activation of the complement system can precipitate the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which lead to inflammatory responses. Recent studies have highlighted that the NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in MN. The genomic and transcriptomic involvement of the NF-κB pathway has been demonstrated in MN pathogenesis. Patients with MN exhibit increased protein expression of NF-κB p65, and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and IκBα was shown to increase in the MN model rats, demonstrating that activated NF-κB is linked with MN. Additionally, the suppression of NF-κB leads to a reduction in proteinuria, amelioration of renal damage and inflammation, and restoration of podocyte injury in experimental MN rat models. The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family, characterized by K63-ubiquitin chain modification, acts as a scaffold for upstream complexes to activate downstream signals such as the NF-κB signaling pathway. TRAF6, a member of this family, plays a role in the pathogenesis of various renal diseases by regulating the activation of NF-κB. In adenine-induced mice, elevated renal levels of TRAF6, NF-κB p65 and p-NF-κB p65 were observed., TRAF6 silencing can protect against inflammation in LPS-induced HK-2 cells, while TRAF6 overexpression mitigates the inhibition of p-NF-κB p65 and inflammation. These findings underscore the importance of the TRAF6-mediated NF-κB pathway in regulating inflammation in renal disease. Consequently, we hypothesized that TRAF6/NF-κB axis-mediated inflammation was associated with podocyte injury and MN progression.Current treatments for MN include steroids and immunosuppressive agents, which have side effects. The exploration of alternative adjunctive therapeutic modalities is of great importance. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has substantial therapeutic effects on various chronic diseases, including renal disease. Nevertheless, due to the complex composition of traditional Chinese medicinal agents, the precise mechanisms by which these interventions ameliorate pathological conditions remain to be elucidated. Previous reports have shown that Astragalus membranaceus (Huang-Qi) is commonly used in the treatment of membranous nephropathy, which can reduce proteinuria and promote diuresis and detumorment by regulating immunity, anti-inflammation, antioxidation and other mechanisms, is commonly used to treat MN. Adjunctive use of A. membranaceus combined with supportive care or immunosuppressive therapy has shown to improve the response rate and serum albumin (ALB) concentration and reduce proteinuria and serum creatinine levels compared to immunosuppressive therapy alone in MN patients. In addition, MN patients resistant to cyclosporine and mycophenolate achieved complete remission after taking TCM containing A. membranaceus. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is a key active constituent of A. membranaceus. Its effects include reducing the serum creatinine concentration, mitigating proteinuria, and attenuating complications such as anemia and malnutrition. Studies have shown that AS-IV possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and immunomodulatory properties. It exerts kidney-protective effects by mitigating podocyte apoptosis, abating oxidative stress, and inhibiting the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway, all of which contribute to renal injury. However, there is currently an absence of direct evidence showing the impact of AS-IV on the function of TRAF6.In this study, we investigated the influence of AS-IV on TRAF6 using a passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) rat model and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms that drive podocyte inflammatory damage through the TRAF6/NF-κB pathway.","AS-IV (A928102, with a purity of ≥ 98%) was purchased from Macklin.Forty-five male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (5 weeks of age, weighing 150 ± 10 g) were purchased from Sibeifu Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing (Licence: SCXK (Beijing) 2019-0010). All rats were raised at a temperature of 20–25 °C, humidity of 30–40% and a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. The rats were provided unrestricted access to clean food and water for one week prior to the experiments. All experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (application no. 202307A045) and adhered to the guidelines stipulated by the National Animal Welfare Law of China. The handling of animals was in accordance with internationally relevant laboratory animal regulations.We established a PHN model in 36 male SD rats by injecting sheep anti-rat FX1A serum (0.8 mL/100 g body weight, PTX-002S; Probetex, San Antonio, TX), which shares a similar pathogenic mechanism and clinical manifestation of MN in humans. The nine rats in the control group received an equivalent volume of saline via intraperitoneal injection. One week after anti-Fx1 injection, the PHN rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 9 per group): a model group, a low-dose AS-IV group, a high-dose AS-IV group, and a prednisone group. Rats in the low-dose AS-IV group, high-dose AS-IV group and prednisone group were administered double distilled water (1 mL/100 g/d) containing AS-IV at doses of 20 mg/kg/d, 40 mg/kg/d, or prednisone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d, respectively. The control group and PHN model group rats received the same volume of double distilled water. All fluids and medications were administered through oral gavage one week after administration of sheep anti-rat Fx1A serum to establish the PHN model.Following a four-week treatment regimen, blood and 24-h urine samples were collected and centrifuged (3500 rpm, 4 °C). The collected urine samples were used to evaluate the 24-h urine protein excretion (24 h-UPE) levels, while the blood samples were used to measure serum creatine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), ALB, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α levels. Thereafter, all rats were intraperitoneally administered 1% pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). Kidney tissues from six rats per group were isolated and stored at −80 °C for subsequent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RT–qPCR, Western blot and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses. The remaining three rats were perfused with saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for histopathological assessment.The MPC5 cell line, a conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte line, was obtained from iCell Bioscience, Inc. (iCell-m081) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Solarbio, 10491). The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, 10270-106), 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Solarbio, P1400) and 10 U/ml recombinant mouse interferon-γ (IFN-γ; Solarbio, P00215). The cells were cultured at 33 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 to maintain a proliferative state. After they were transferred to a 37 °C incubator without IFN-γ, the MPC5 cells ceased proliferating, initiated differentiation, and matured into podocytes in 14 days. Following this, further studies were conducted using mature MPC5 cells kept in a 37 °C incubator. MPC5 cells were stimulated for 24 h with TNF-α (40 ng/mL; Sigma, T7539), both with and without AS-IV (at concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 μM).MPC5 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were converted into single-cell suspensions, and the cell density was adjusted to 2 × 105 cells/mL. Subsequently, these cells were seeded in 60 mm dishes at 4 mL/well and cultured in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 overnight. The TRAF6 overexpression (TRAF6-OE) lentivirus (provided by Shanghai Genechem Co., Ltd.) was transiently transfected (MOI = 30) for 12–24 h (the specific time was determined according to the state of the cells). After that, the transfection reagent was removed, and the regular complete medium was replaced for continued culture. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were digested and replated, ensuring that the cell samples were appropriately prepared for the desired Western blot experiments.Blood and urine samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for subsequent measurements. 24 h-UPE was assessed by the biuret method with an automatic biochemical instrument. The BUN, SCr and ALB were detected using commercial kits (BUN: ZC-S0480, SCr: ZC-A1191, and ALB: ZC-36315).Kidney samples were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in graded alcohol and dimethylbenzene and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned into 4 μm-thick slices for various staining techniques. The renal tissue slices were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining according to the manufacturer’s protocol and scored as previously described to evaluate renal structural injury. Renal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining using a Masson staining kit, and semiquantitative analysis was performed according to the percentage of collagen area stained in the visual field. For periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, renal tissue slices were incubated with a periodic acid solution for 5 min and sequentially with Schiff reagent for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark after being washed with ddH2O and then counterstained with hematoxylin. We used PAS staining to observe the mesangial matrix and basement membrane and evaluate glomerular sclerosis. Periodic acid-silver methenamine (PASM) staining was used to identify the GBM in kidney tissue. Kidney sections were preheated, treated with silver staining fluid and washed with distilled water. Then, the sections were incubated in 2% gold chloride solution, washed, treated in 2% sodium thiosulfate solution, washed, double stained with hematoxylin or eosin, dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and sealed with neutral gum.For tissue immunofluorescence analysis, 4 μm-thick sections of paraffin-embedded kidney tissues were subjected to sequential deparaffinization and rehydration using xylene and an ethanol gradient. Antigen retrieval was conducted using sodium citrate antigen repair solution for 10 min, followed by incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were blocked with a goat serum blocking solution for 30 min. Afterwards, the sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with goat anti-rat IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 594) (Abcam, ab150160, 1:1000 dilution) and primary antibodies targeting TRAF6 (Abcam, ab33915, 1:200). The secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor-488 (Abcam, ab150077, 1:1000) were added to the sections previously treated with the primary TRAF6 antibodies. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the slides were washed with PBS and sealed with neutral balsam. Images were collected and analyzed using a fluorescence microscope.For a subset of cultured cells, the MPC5 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, blotted to dryness, and rinsed three times with 1× PBS for 5 min each. The cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10–15 min, after which the permeabilization solution was discarded, and the cells were subsequently washed three times with PBS for 5 min each. Blocks were incubated with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies against NF-κB (1:100, Abcam, ab16502) and TRAF6 (1:200, Abcam, ab137452). After washing with 1× PBS, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature in the dark for 1–2 h. Each sample was stained with propidium iodide (PI, Solarbio, C0080) for 10 min while kept in the dark. The slides were sealed with an anti-quench sealant. Fluorescence microscopy was used for observation and analysis.Total RNA was extracted from rat kidney tissues and treated MPC5 cells using a total RNA extraction kit (Solarbio, R1200), and qPCR was conducted with a TaqMan One Step RT–qPCR kit (Solarbio, T2210) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following primers were used (5′→3′) for the PHN rats: TNF-α (F): CGTGTTCATCCGTTCTCTACC, TNF-α (R): GCAATCCAGGCCACTACTT, IL-1β (F): TGATGTTCCCATTAGACAGC, IL-1β (R): GAGGTGCTGATGTACCAGTT, IL-6 (F): CCGTTTCTACCTGGAGTTTGT, and IL-6 (R): GTTTGCCGAGTAGACCTCATAG. The following primers were used for the MPC5 cells: TNF-α (F): AGGCACTCCCCCAAAAGATG, TNF-α (R): CCACTTGGTGGTTTGTGAGTG, IL-1β (F): GAAATGCCACCTTTTGACAGTGA, IL-1β (R): GTCCTCATCCTGGAAGGTCC, IL-6 (F): ACGATGATGCACTTGCAGAAA, IL-6 (R): CTGTGACTCCAGCTTATCTCTTG, GAPDH (F): GCCTCCTCCAATTCAACCCT, and GAPDH (R): CTCGTGGTTCACACCCATCA.The supernatants obtained from renal tissues and MPC5 cells were collected after lysis with prepared RIPA lysis buffer (containing 1% PMSF and 2% phosphatase inhibitors). To determine the protein concentration in the supernatant, a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Biyuntian, P0012S) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Equivalent quantities of proteins from each sample were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against nephrin (1:1000, Abcam, ab216341), desmin (1:100000, Abcam, ab32362), TRAF6 (1:2000, Abcam, ab137452), NF-κB (1:1000, Abcam, ab16502), phosphorylated NF-κB (p-NF-κB) (1:1000, Abcam, ab76302), K48 (1:1000, Abcam, ab140601), and GAPDH (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, 5174) at 4 °C overnight. Following incubation with primary and secondary antibodies and washing, the protein bands were visualized using a Tanon gel imaging system. Further analysis of the grey values associated with the protein bands was conducted using ImageJ software.The levels of IL-6 and IL-1β in the MPC5 cells were detected by commercial kits, including a mouse IL-6 ELISA kit (IC50325-1, mlbio, Shanghai, China) and a mouse IL-1β ELISA kit (mIC50300-1, mlbio, Shanghai, China), following the manufacturer’s protocol. IL-6 and IL-1β levels are expressed in pg/mL.Co-IP cell lysate was added to the tissue fragments or cells for lysis. These lysates were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for protein quantification. Lysates were incubated with an anti-TRAF6 antibody (Abcam, ab137452) or an anti-IgG antibody overnight at 4 °C. This mixture was then precipitated with 50% Protien A/G agarose bead solution and lightly shaken overnight at 4 °C. The resulting bound precipitate was separated by centrifugation. The precipitate was denatured with 1× loading buffer for 10 min at 100 °C. Western blots were subsequently performed.MPC5 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded in 60 mm dishes at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/well and allowed to adhere for 24 h. For the CHX assays, all experimental groups were treated with TNF-α + CHX (10 μg/mL; Sigma, 239765), with or without a high concentration of AS-IV. This treatment was carried out for intervals of 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h. Then, cells were harvested for Western blot experiments. For the MG132 assays, all experimental groups were treated with TNF-α + MG-132 (5 μM; Sigma, 474791) with or without a high concentration of AS-IV for 24 h. After the designated treatment period, cells were collected for Western blot and co-IP experiments.The data were processed and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Comparisons between two groups were made using t tests. Multiple comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA. The homogeneous data were analyzed using the least significant difference (LSD) test, and the heterogeneous data were analyzed with Dunnett’s test. p < 0.05 indicated a significant difference.","To determine the effect of AS-IV on kidney injury, we treated PHN rats with AS-IV. As depicted in Figure 1(A–D), a marked increase in the serum BUN, SCr and 24 h-UPE levels occurred in the PHN rats compared with those in the control group (BUN: PHN vs. control, 56.82 ± 4.98 vs. 13.47 ± 2.51, p < 0.0001; SCr: PHN vs. control, 112.04 ± 7.71 vs. 50.40 ± 5.90, p < 0.0001; 24 h-UPE: PHN vs. control, 25.34 ± 5.04 vs. 4.22 ± 1.55, p < 0.0001). Correspondingly, there was a marked decrease in the serum ALB level (PHN vs. control, 20.30 ± 2.57 vs. 28.80 ± 1.35, p = 0.0034). In contrast, the rats in the low-dose AS-IV and high-dose AS-IV groups all exhibited decreased serum BUN, SCr, 24 h-UPE levels (BUN: PHN vs. low-dose AS-IV, 56.82 ± 4.98 vs. 45.19 ± 5.34, p = 0.0369, PHN vs. high-dose AS-IV, 56.82 ± 4.98 vs. 30.44 ± 4.83, p = 0.0002; SCr: PHN vs. low-dose AS-IV, 112.04 ± 7.71 vs. 88.57 ± 10.54, p = 0.0278, PHN vs. high-dose AS-IV, 112.04 ± 7.71 vs. 73.19 ± 7.28, p = 0.0011; 24 h-UPE: PHN vs. low-dose AS-IV, 25.34 ± 5.04 vs. 17.26 ± 3.75, p = 0.0001, PHN vs. high-dose AS-IV, 25.34 ± 5.04 vs. 13.49 ± 3.24, p < 0.0001), coupled with elevated serum ALB levels (PHN vs. low-dose AS-IV, 20.30 ± 2.57 vs. 23.65 ± 2.59, p = 0.2735, PHN vs. high-dose AS-IV, 20.30 ± 2.57 vs. 25.70 ± 2.48, p = 0.0484). In addition, immunofluorescence staining revealed that the deposition of IgG in the glomerulus was more pronounced in the PHN model group than in the control group and was substantially reduced after AS-IV treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1(E)). Together, these results confirmed that AS-IV mitigated renal injury and immune disorders in PHN rats.To detect the effect of AS-IV on renal pathology in PHN rats, we assessed glomerular lesions using HE, Masson, PAS and PASM staining. As shown in Figure 2, renal pathology, including inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 2(A)), renal fibrosis (Figure 2(B)), GBM thickening (Figure 2(C)) and GBM atrophy (Figure 2(D)), was more severe in the PHN model group than in the control group. However, AS-IV treatment significantly alleviated the above changes (Figure 2(A–D)). Notably, AS-IV improved the histopathology of kidney lesions in MN rats.To detect the effect of AS-IV on podocytes in PHN rats, we examined the expression of nephrin (the major component of podocytes) and desmin (a cytoskeletal protein in podocytes) in rat kidney tissue and observed the ultrastructure of the podocytes by electron microscopy. Compared with the control group, the fusion of podocyte foot processes was increased and the GBM was thickened in the PHN group. Compared with the PHN group, the AS-IV group exhibited some remission in foot process fusion and GBM thickening (Figure 3A). In addition, the expression of nephrin in the kidney tissue of the PHN group was reduced compared with that in the control group. In contrast, desmin expression was much greater in the PHN group than in the control group. We observed that AS-IV treatment facilitated the restoration of nephrin but decreased desmin expression (Figure 3(B–D)). The above results indicated that AS-IV successfully protected against podocyte injury.As illustrated in Figure 4, the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in the kidneys of the model group were greater than those in the control group (p < 0.05). In contrast, treatment with a low-dose or a high-dose of AS-IV significantly reduced the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β (Figure 4). These findings suggested that AS-IV effectively suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the kidneys of PHN rats.To understand the anti-inflammatory effects of AS-IV, immunofluorescence and Western blot were used to evaluate the expression profiles of targets of the TRAF6/NF-κB pathway. In parallel, the polyubiquitination status of TRAF6 was probed using co-IP. In the model group, the levels of TRAF6 and p-NF-κB were increased in the kidney tissues of PHN rats (Figure 5). Intriguingly, a concomitant decrease in K48-ubiquitination of TRAF6 occurred relative to the control group. Overall, AS-IV intervention alleviated the levels of TRAF6 and p-NF-κB and the ubiquitination of TRAF6 in PHN rats.MPC5 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and 6-well plates. Following pretreatment with different concentrations of AS-IV (low concentration: 25 μM, moderate concentration: 50 μM, high concentration: 100 μM), the cells were subsequently stimulated with TNF-α (40 ng/mL) for 24 h. The results underscore the substantial role of AS-IV in revitalizing cells (Figure 6(A)) while concurrently influencing the concentration-dependent decrease in the mRNA levels of key proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, elicited by TNF-α stimulation (Figure 6(B–D)).We found that in normal MPC5 cells, NF-κB predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Conversely, in TNF-α-activated MPC5 cells, an increase in nuclear NF-κB expression was detected. Interestingly, AS-IV attenuated the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 7(A,B)). Furthermore, TNF-α-activated MPC5 cells also expressed significantly more p-NF-κB, and AS-IV suppressed the production of p-NF-κB (Figure 7(C,D)). In addition, AS-IV significantly downregulated TRAF6 expression (Figure 7(C, E–G)) while concurrently enhancing the K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 in comparison to that in MPC5 cells stimulated with TNF-α alone (Figure 7(H,I)).To elucidate the mechanism by which AS-IV decreased the protein level of TRAF6, we investigated TRAF6 protein stability by evaluating the effects of AS-IV in the presence of CHX. As demonstrated in Figure 8(A,B), AS-IV treatment reduced TRAF6 protein stability. Notably, TRAF6 is degraded through proteasomal pathways that often involve K48-linked ubiquitination. Building upon previous findings that indicated that AS-IV induced upregulation of TRAF6 K48 ubiquitination, we incubated MPC5 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to determine whether AS-IV-mediated TRAF6 degradation was intricately linked to K48 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent processes. As shown in Figure 8(C,D), the addition of AS-IV substantially increased the number of K48-linked ubiquitin chains compared with the addition of MG132 alone. This observation indicated that AS-IV promoted TRAF6 degradation by enhancing K48 ubiquitination, thus enhancing the proteasomal pathway involved in TRAF6 turnover.First, the efficacy of TRAF6-OE was assessed using qPCR, and a significant increase in TRAF6 mRNA levels occurred (Figure 9(A,B)), suggesting successful transfection of the TRAF6-OE lentivirus. As depicted in Figure 9(C,D), TRAF6-OE led to an increase in p-NF-κB, IL-6 and IL-1β levels. In addition, AS-IV treatment of TRAF6-OE cells failed to attenuate the NF-κB pathway, whereas it effectively reduced p-NF-κB, IL-6 and IL-1β levels in the control group. Taken together, these findings suggested that TRAF6-OE inhibits the anti-inflammatory potential of AS-IV in MPC5 cells by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway.","Inflammation and the NF-κB pathway have been shown to play an integral role in podocyte injury in the pathogenesis of MN. Notably, TCM interventions using animal MN models showed promise in ameliorating this condition by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. This led to an exploration of the impact of TCM on renal inflammation and podocyte injury in MN patients. In the present study, we focused on elucidating the protective effects of AS-IV on podocyte injury, with a specific emphasis on the regulation of the TRAF6 and NF-κB signaling pathways in PHN rats and MPC5 cells. In our initial in vivo experiments using PHN rats, we observed that AS-IV administration led to reductions in proteinuria and serum creatinine levels that were coupled with increases in serum ALB in both the low- and high-dose AS-IV groups. Notably, the amelioration of clinical manifestations was dose-dependent. Furthermore, AS-IV administration mitigated pathological manifestations, including the fusion of podocyte foot processes, IgG deposition, GBM thickening and collagen fibrosis in renal tissues. The increase in the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in the kidneys of PHN rats was effectively reversed by AS-IV treatment. In vitro experiments involving MPC5 cells further revealed that AS-IV could enhance cell viability while concurrently reducing the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in response to TNF-α stimulation. Based on these results, we determined the key molecules and pathways by which AS-IV acted on MN. Our investigation revealed upregulated expression of TRAF6 and p-NF-κB, accompanied by increased translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus and decreased K48-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF6 in both the kidney tissues of PHN rats and TNF-α-activated MPC5 cells. Remarkably, AS-IV treatment counteracted these effects, leading to an attenuation of the observed changes. Furthermore, insights gained from experiments involving MG132 and CHX treatments suggested that the degradation of TRAF6 was predominantly governed by K48 ubiquitination and the proteasome-associated pathway. Finally, we discovered that TRAF6 overexpression inhibited the anti-inflammatory potential of AS-IV by activating the NF-κB pathway. These novel findings illuminate the therapeutic potential of AS-IV in ameliorating renal dysfunction and podocyte injury in MN patients. These effects are closely intertwined with the capacity of AS-IV to modulate inflammation mediated by TRAF6 ubiquitination and the NF-κB signaling pathway.The traditional Chinese herb A. membranaceus is a widely recognized for its therapeutic effects and low toxicity and is commonly used for treating infections, inflammation and cancer. Among its major bioactive ingredients, AS-IV possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and immune-promoting properties that safeguard multiple organs, such as the heart, lung, kidney and brain. Previous studies revealed that AS-IV has a wide range of renoprotective effects. For example, AS-IV can ameliorate renal tubular epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by high glucose through the CX3CL1-RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In addition, during the early stage of renal ischaemia–reperfusion injury (IRI), AS-IV can reduce proinflammatory responses and macrophage infiltration by inhibiting the NF-κB (p65)/Hif-1α pathway and enhancing Smad7 expression. The protective effects of AS-IV on podocytes have also been documented, with studies indicating its ability to inhibit podocyte apoptosis by attenuating oxidative stress via PPARγ-Klotho-FoxO1 axis activation in diabetic nephropathy. Moreover, AS-IV can alleviate cytoskeletal injury through the Wnt/PCP pathway in puromycin aminonucleoside-stimulated podocytes. In this study, we found that AS-IV increased the K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6, consequently suppressing the overexpression of p-NF-κB, a proinflammatory cytokine, and the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus in both PHN rats and TNF-α-stimulated MPC5 cells. Consistent findings from in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the protective effect of AS-IV on MN is due to its anti-inflammatory effects on podocytes.Podocytes play a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and regulating renal permeability to diverse molecules, making them primary targets for immune deposits that accumulate beneath the glomerular capillary wall and lead to the subsequent formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in MN. Podocyte injuries caused by the MAC include protein kinases, reactive oxygen species, transcription factors, growth factors, proteinases, and stress pathways. Among these factors, an accumulating body of evidence underscores the significance of the NF-κB signaling pathway in immune modulation and in the pathogenesis of MN. In this study, we established a PHN rat model and utilized TNF-α-stimulated MPC5 cells to simulate MN-related renal lesions and podocyte injury. Consistent with previous observations, we detected increased p-NF-κB levels in the kidney tissues of PHN rats and TNF-α-stimulated MPC5 cells and increased NF-κB nuclear expression in TNF-α-activated MPC5 cells. A prior study showed that AS-IV reinstated podocyte morphology and cytoskeleton structure in MAC-stimulated podocytes. In addition, AS-IV decreased NF-κB activity; suppressed TNF-α, MCP-1 and ICAM-1 expression in kidney tissue to protect against renal damage in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; and inhibited podocyte EMT via the SIRT1-NF-κB pathway in glucose-stimulated podocytes. This study revealed that AS-IV downregulated p-NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β expression in the kidneys of PHN rats and in TNF-α-stimulated podocytes. These findings demonstrate that the NF-κB pathway and related proinflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of MN and that AS-IV has potential for kidney protection through the NF-κB pathway.Recent studies have shed light on the role of TRAF6 polyubiquitination in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway activation. TRAF6 functions as an unconventional E3 ubiquitin ligase, with its K63-ubiquitin chain being capable of self-modification and consequent activation of NF-κB, thereby participating in the inflammatory process. Conversely, the K48-ubiquitin chain tags substrates for proteasomal degradation. The TRAF6-mediated suppression of ubiquitination impedes NF-κB signaling in podocytes, epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells in the kidneys of IRI rats. Studies have shown that TRAF6 is involved in various kidney diseases. Increased TRAF6 expression has been detected in renal tissues of MRL/Ipr mice (lupus nephritis model), acute kidney IRI model mice and LPS-induced podocytes. However, changes in TRAF6 expression and function in MN have not been studied. We speculated that TRAF6 might also be involved in the pathogenesis of MN by regulating the NF-kB pathway. Our findings revealed elevated TRAF6 expression and reduced K48-mediated TRAF6 ubiquitination in the kidney tissues of PHN rats and TNF-α-stimulated MPC5 cells. Li et al. discovered that AS-IV treatment can reduce the expression of TRAF6 and subsequently inhibit NF-κB phosphorylation. Our results are consistent with those of Li et al.; we observed that AS-IV reversed TRAF6 and p-NF-κB expression and promoted TRAF6 ubiquitination in PHN rats and TNF-α-induced MPC5 cells. Our results support the potential for AS-IV to regulate NF-κB through the modulation of TRAF6 expression and ubiquitination, indicating that AS-IV is a promising clinical target for treating MN patients. However, there are some limitations to our study. First, our investigations were limited to murine models and cultured cells, warranting further validation in MN patients to verify the clinical effect. Second, the impact of AS-IV on normal rats has not been explored and requires future examination.",Our results demonstrate a pivotal role of TRAF6 in governing NF-κB-mediated kidney injury in MN and the potential for AS-IV to mitigate pathogenesis through the TRAF6/NF-κB pathway. These findings provide a foundation for future therapeutic strategies for managing MN.
7,TA037737,10.3390/molecules16086489,Inhibitory effect and possible mechanism of action of patchouli alcohol againstinfluenza A (H2N2) virus.,"In the present study, the anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity of patchoulialcohol was studied in vitro, in vivo and in silico. The CC₅₀ of patchoulialcohol was above 20 µM. Patchouli alcohol could inhibit influenza virus with anIC₅₀ of 4.03 ± 0.23 µM. MTT assay showed that the inhibition by patchouli alcoholappears strongly after penetration of the virus into the cell. In the influenzamouse model, patchouli alcohol showed obvious protection against the viralinfection at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Flexible docking and molecular dynamicsimulations indicated that patchouli alcohol was bound to the neuraminidaseprotein of influenza virus, with an interaction energy of -40.38 kcal mol⁻¹. Theinvariant key active-site residues Asp151, Arg152, Glu119, Glu276 and Tyr406played important roles during the binding process. Based on spatial and energeticcriteria, patchouli alcohol interfered with the NA functions. Results presentedhere suggest that patchouli alcohol possesses anti-influenza A (H2N2) virusproperties, and therefore is a potential source of anti-influenza agents for thepharmaceutical industry.","Wu, Huaxing, Li, Beili, Wang, Xue, Jin, Mingyuan, Wang, Guonian",2011,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"The influenza virus, which is one of the main causes of acute respiratory infections in humans, can lead to annual epidemics and infrequent pandemics. The two influenza pandemics of the 20th century, “Asian Influenza (1957/H2N2)” and “Hong Kong Influenza (1968/H3N2)” resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2–3 million people globally. Today, their descendants continue to cause the majority of influenza infections in humans. So far as it is learned that the most effective antiviral drug is the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor, which target the NA glycoproteins of influenza A and B virus.The release of new virions from the infected cell is a key step in the influenza life cycle and need neuraminidase (NA) to cleave the α-ketosidic linkage between terminal sialic acid and an adjacent sugar residue. The NA inhibitors were designed to prevent the key step by blocking the active site of enzyme and thus allow sufficient time for the host immune systems to remove infected viruses. Consistent efforts have been devoted to the development of NA inhibitors, using the crystal structure of the N2 sub-type NA protein. Indeed, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is the representative NA inhibitor that has proven to be uniquely applicable oral drug in clinical practice for the treatment of influenza infection. However, with an increase in medical use, the oseltamivir-resistant strains have been found and probably lead to a large scale outbreak of novel pandemic flu.Patchouli alcohol (Figure 1) has been well known for over a century. It is a major constituent of the pungent oil from the East Indian shrub Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth, and widely used in fragrances. Patchouli oil is an important essential oil in the perfume industry, used to give a base and lasting character to a fragrance. The essential oil is very appreciated for its characteristic pleasant and long lasting woody, earthy, and camphoraceous odor, as well as for its fixative properties, being suitable for use in soaps and cosmetic products. The aerial part of Pogostemon cablin has wildly been used for the treatment of the common cold and as an antifungal agent in China. Moreover, the plant is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as it presents various types of pharmacological activity according to the composition of the oil. Patchouli alcohol, as the major volatile constituent of patchouli oil, has been found to strongly inhibit H1N1 replication and weakly inhibit B/Ibaraki/2/85 replication. To the best of our knowledge, the anti-influenza virus (H2N2) activities of patchouli alcohol have not been evaluated yet. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-influenza A virus (H2N2) activity of patchouli alcohol by MTT assay and mouse influenza model. On such basis, explicitly solvated docking and molecular dynamic (MD) methods were applied to investigative the binding mode involving patchouli alcohol with influenza virus NA protein. We anticipate that the insight into the understanding of inhibiting mechanism will be of value in the rational design of novel anti-influenza drugs.","Patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA, purity > 99%) and was stored in glass vials with Teflon sealed caps at −20 ± 0.5 °C in the absence of light.MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) was purchased from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (Harbin, Heilongjiang, China). The cells were grown in monolayer culture with Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The monolayers were removed from their plastic surfaces and serially passaged whenever they became confluent. Cells were plated out onto 96-well culture plates for cytotoxicity and anti-influenza assays, and propagated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.The influenza strain A/Leningrad/134/17/1957 H2N2) was purchased from National Control Institute of Veterinary Bioproducts and Pharmaceuticals (Beijing, China). Virus was routinely grown on MDCK cells. The stock cultures were prepared from supernatants of infected cells and stored at −80 °C.The cellular toxicity of patchouli alcohol on MDCK cells was assessed by the MTT method. Briefly, cells were seeded on a microtiter plate in the absence or presence of various concentrations (20 µM – 0.0098 µM) of patchouli alcohol (eight replicates) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 72 h. The supernatants were discarded, washed with PBS twice and MTT reagent (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the supernatants were removed, then 200 μL DMSO was added and incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min. After that the plates were read on an ELISA reader (Thermo Molecular Devices Co., Union City, USA) at 570/630 nm. The mean OD of the cell control wells was assigned a value of 100%. The maximal non-toxic concentration (TD0) and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) were calculated by linear regression analysis of the dose-response curves generated from the data.Inhibition of virus replication was measured by the MTT method. Serial dilution of the treated virus was adsorbed to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. The residual inoculum was discared and infected cells were added with EMEM containing 2% FCS. Each assay was performed in eight replicates. After incubation for 72 h at 37 °C, the cultures were measured by MTT method as described above. The concentration of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir which inhibited virus numbers by 50% (IC50) was determined from dose-response curves.Cells and viruses were incubated with patchouli alcohol at different stages during the viral infection cycle in order to determine the mode of antiviral action. Cells were pretreated with patchouli alcohol before viral infection, viruses were incubated with patchouli alcohol before infection and cells and viruses were incubated together with patchouli alcohol during adsorption or after penetration of the virus into the host cells. Patchouli alcohol was always used at the nontoxic concentration. Cell monolayers were pretreated with patchouli alcohol prior to inoculation with virus by adding patchouli alcohol to the culture medium and incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. The compound was aspirated and cells were washed immediately before the influenza A (H2N2) inoculum was added. For pretreatment virus, Influenza A (H2N2) was incubated in medium containing patchouli alcohol for 1h at room temperature prior to infection of MDCK cells. For analyzing the anti-influenza A (H2N2) inhibition during the adsorption period, the same amount of influenza A (H2N2) was mixed with the drug and added to the cells immediately. After 1 h of adsorption at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed and DMEM supplemented with 2 % FCS were added to the cells. The effect of patchouli alcohol against influenza A (H2N2) was also tested during the replication period by adding it after adsorption, as typical performed in anti-influenza A (H2N2) susceptibility studies. Each assay was run in eight replicates. Kunming mice, weighing 18–22 g (6 weeks of age) were purchased from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute Animal Co., Ltd. (Harbin, Heilongjiang, China). First, the toxicity of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir was assessed in the healthy mice by the loss of body weight compared with the control group (2% DMSO in physiological saline). The mice were orally administered with 10 mg/kg/dose patchouli alcohol, 2 mg/kg/dose patchouli alcohol or 2 mg/kg/dose oseltamivir (dissolved in 2% DMSO in physiological saline) one time daily for 7 days. The weight of mice was determined daily. We conducted procedures according to Principle of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH Publication No. 85 – 23, revised 1985) and the guidelines of the Peking University Animal Research Committee. Kunming mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and exposed to virus (A/Leningrad/134/17/1957) by intranasal instillation. Drugs were prepared in 2% DMSO in physiological saline and administered 4 h prior to virus exposure and continued daily for 5 days. All mice were observed daily for changes in weight and for any deaths. Parameters for evaluation of antiviral activity included weight loss, reduction in mortality and/or increase in mean day to death (MDD) determined through 15 days.The N2 sub-type neuraminidase crystal structure (PDB code 1IVD) was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. For convenience, the structure is named as NA hereafter. Geometry and partial atomic charges of the patchouli alcohol (Figure 1) were calculated with the Discover 3.0 module (Insight II 2005) by applying the BFGS algorithm and the consistent-valence force-field (CVFF), with a convergence criterion of 0.01 kcal mol−1 Å−1. The docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed by the general protocols in the Insight II 2005 software packages, consistent with the previous literatures. During the MD simulations, the canonical ensemble (NVT) was employed at normal temperature (300 K). The MD temperature was controlled by the velocity scaling thermostat. Integrations of the classical equations of motion were achieved using the Verlet algorithm. The systems were solvated in a large sphere of TIP3P water molecules with the radius of 35.0 Å, which is enough to hold the ensembles. The MD trajectories were generated using a 1.0-fs time step for a total of 20.0 ns, saved at 5.0-ps intervals. The interaction energies of patchouli alcohol with NA and the respective residues at the NA active site were calculated by the Docking module, over the 0.5~20.0 ns MD trajectories. All results are expressed as mean values ± standard deviations (SDs) (n = 3). The significance of difference was calculated by one-way analysis of variance, and values p < 0.001 were considered to be significant.","First the efficacy of patchouli alcohol on influenza A (H2N2) virus replication and cell viability were examined. CC50 was used to express the cytotoxicity of patchouli alcohol on MDCK. The CC50 of patchouli alcohol was above 20 mM, which indicated that patchouli alcohol did not affect the growth of MDCK (Table 1). Thus, it seems that the antiviral effects of patchouli alcohol were not due to the cytotoxicity. Moreover, patchouli alcohol was found to inhibit influenza A (H2N2) virus with an IC50 of 4.03 ± 0.23 µM. Based on the IC50 and CC50 values, the selectivity index (SI) was calculated as >4.96. It is reported that a SI of 4 or more is appropriate for an antiviral agent, suggesting that patchouli alcohol can be judged to have anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity.Until now, it has been found that patchouli alcohol showed dose-dependent anti-influenza virus (A/PR/8/34, H1N1) activity, with an IC50 value of 2.635 µM. Furthermore, it showed weak activity against B/Ibaraki/2/85 (IC50 = 40.82 µM). With the addition of the above H2N2 inhibitory activity, we have a comprehensively view of the anti-influenza activity of patchouli alcohol.Cells were pretreated with patchouli alcohol prior to virus infection (pretreatment cells), viruses were pretreated prior to infection (pretreatment virus), and patchouli alcohol was added during the adsorption period (adsorption) or after penetration of the viruses into cells (replication). Experiments were repeated independently three times and data presented are the average of three experiments. The symbols * indicated very significant difference p < 0.01 with respect to other mode (pretreatment virus, adsorption and pretreatment cell).As shown in Figure 2, patchouli alcohol showed anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity in a time-dependent manner. It showed best antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 8 µM during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 97.68% ± 2.09% for influenza A (H2N2) at 72 h. However, no significant effect was detected when patchouli alcohol was used for pretreatment of cells or viruses or when patchouli alcohol was only added during the adsorption phase. These results suggested that the inhibition of influenza A (H2N2) virus by patchouli alcohol appears to occur much more strongly after penetration of the virus into the cell. Besides, biochemical studies have indicated that the bioactivity of NA protein is essential determinant after the replication of influenza A (H2N2) virus. Hence, we conclude that the function of NA protein may be suppressed by patchouli alcohol.To evaluate the toxicity of patchouli alcohol, the mean value of body weight of mice in each group was statistically analyzed. The mean weights of mice administered at the 2 mg/kg/dose oseltamivir, 2 mg/kg/dose patchouli alcohol and 10 mg/kg/dose of patchouli alcohol one time daily for 7 days were not significantly different compared with the normal control mice, showing no toxicity of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir within the testing concentration (P > 0.05). Physiological status was observed in virus infection mice. Three days after viral infection, some mice, especially mice in the H2N2 infected control group showed changes in behavior, such as a tendency to huddle, diminished vitality, and ruffled fur, etc. In the mouse influenza model, viral infection leads to loss of body weight and high mortality. Therefore, the efficacy of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir were evaluated on the basis of survival rate measured for 15 days post-infection, for treated infected animals relative to untreated infected (control) animals. A comparison of efficacy of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir in vivo mouse influenza model (oral treatment) showed that at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day, patchouli alcohol showed obvious protection against the influenza virus, as the mean day to death was detected as 11.8 ± 1.1 (Table 2). When the dose was lowered to 1 mg/kg/day, patchouli alcohol showed weaker protection (measured by Survivors/total) than that of 5 mg/kg/day, the mean day to death was 7.5 ± 1.8. Whereas oseltamivir at this dose level (1 mg/kg/day) showed 50% protection (measured by survivors/total) against the influenza virus. In the H2N2 infected control group, there were no survivors. In view of both in vitro and in vivo data, we conclude that patchouli alcohol could be used in the treatment of human influenza virus infections.Based on the above experiment data, patchouli alcohol is determined to be bound within NA protein. As the total energies and backbone root-mean-square-deviations (RMSD) in Figure 3 indicate, the energy-minimized patchouli alcohol-NA complex has been in equilibrium since about 0.5 ns, and then retains quite stable in the last 19.5 ns. It is consistent with the previous MD results of other NA inhibitors. Accordingly, the geometric and energetic analyses were made on the average structures of 0.5~20.0 ns MD trajectories, where the system has been already at equilibrium. The interaction energy (Einter) of patchouli alcohol with NA was calculated at −40.38 kcal mol−1, where the vdW rather than electrostatic interactions were found to play a dominant role, contribute to about 72% (−29.18 kcal mol−1). As shown in Figure 4, the patchouli alcohol was bound at the active site which also bound to oseltamivir and zanamivir. As Figure 5 shows, the oxygen atom of patchouli alcohol was oriented towards the sidechains of residues Glu119 and Tyr406, with one H-bond formed with each residue. The values of distances in Figure 6 further reveal that the docked complex remains rather stable throughout the simulation, with the average distances of Glu119:OE2 — patchouli alcohol:O and Tyr406:OH — patchouli alcohol:O less than 2.8 Å. The sum contributions (Esum) of residues Glu119 and Tyr406 amounted to −8.46 and −7.37 kcal mol−1, respectively (Table 3). Besides, patchouli alcohol was stabilized by residues Arg118, Asp151, Arg152, Trp178, Ala246, Glu276, Arg292, Asn294 and Gln347, especially residues Asp151, Arg152 and Glu276 (Figure 5 and Table 3). As a matter of fact, residues Asp151, Arg152, Glu119, Glu276 and Tyr406 of the NA protein have already received enough attention from rational drug designs. The catalytic residues Asp151, Arg152 and Glu276 are crucial to the NA functions and the residues Glu119 and Tyr406 are important to stabilize the NA active sites. It suggests that the NA functions will be affected by the presence of patchouli alcohol, consistent with the above experiments. Patchouli alcohol matches with the NA active site and has an acceptable interaction energy. Considering the obvious structure discrepancies against current NA inhibitors, it represents an ideal lead compound for the designs of novel anti-influenza agents.",,"In conclusion, patchouli alcohol possesses anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity via interference with the NA function that cleaves the α-glycosidic bond between sialic acid and glycoconjugate. Our results provide the promising information for the potential use of patchouli alcohol in the treatment of influenza A (H2N2) virus infectious disease. Further mechanistic studies on the anti-influenza A virus activity are needed to support this point of view. "

This study explored the anticonvulsant effect ofGer in-vitro using nerve growth factor (NGF) prompted PC12 cell injured byGlutamate (Glu) and in-vivo using Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindlingthrough the GABAergic pathway. MATERIALS: To assess the effect of Ger on NGFprompted PC12 cells injured by Glu, Ger at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 200 and400 μg/mL was used. GABA, 5-HT, IL-1β, IL-4, and TNF-α levels and the geneexpressions of GABAA-Rα1, NMDAR1, GAD 65, GAD 67, GAT 1 and GAT 3 were measuredin NGF-induced PC12 cells treated with Ger (100, and 200 μg/mL). Mice wererandomly separated into five groups. Normal and PTZ groups in which mice wereinjected with saline or PTZ, respectively. PTZ + Ger 100, PTZ + Ger 200 and PTZ +SV groups in which mice orally administered Ger or sodium valproate (SV),respectively, then injected with PTZ. RESULTS: Ger up to 400 μg/mL did notdisplay any toxicity or injury in PC12 cells. Ger (100 to 200 μg/mL) reduced theinjury induced by Glu, increased the gene expression of GABAA-Rα1, GAD65 andGAD67 and decreased GAT 1, GAT 3 and NMDAR1 expression in NGF-induced PC12 cellsdamaged by Glu. Ger (100 to 200 μg/mL) increased GABA and reduced TNF-α, IL-4 andIL-1β levels in NGF-induced PC12 cells injured by Glu. As forthe in-vivo results, Ger increased GABA, GAD, GAT 1 and 3 and lowered GABA T. Germitigated MDA, NO, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ, GFAP, caspase-3, and -9 levelsand Bax gene expression and escalated GSH, SOD, catalase, BDNF and Bcl2 geneexpression. CONCLUSION: Ger reduced the oxidative stress status,neuroinflammation and apoptosis and activated GABAergic neurotransmission, whichmight clarify its anticonvulsant. Ger protects animals against PTZ promptedkindling as established by the enhancement in short term as well as long-termmemory. Ger mitigated the injury induced by Glu in NGF prompted PC12 cell.","Younis, Nancy S, Almostafa, Mervt M, Mohamed, Maged E",2024,"Drug design, development and therapy",2,False,False,True,"Geraniol (Ger) is a common ingredient of numerous essential oils such as ninde oil, rose oil, palmarosa oil and citronella oil. Ger has a distinguished rose-like odour and taste and is thus extensively utilised as a fragrance material in cosmetic and household products. Pavan et al performed a study to identify Ger’s pharmacokinetics and bioavailability and concluded that Ger has high bioavailability and is able to permeate the central nervous system following its oral administration, reaching detectable amounts in the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ger exhibits various pharmacological properties including antimicrobial, anti-oxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory proposing this monoterpene alcohol as a promising drug candidate. Ger exhibited neuroprotective effects in diverse neurological conditions including spinal cord injury (SCI). Also, Ger improves functional outcomes in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), diminished the neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) and attenuated behavioral and neurochemical impairments in animals exposed single-prolonged-stress (SPS) provoked post-traumatic disorder (PTSD). Also, Ger exerted an antidepressant action in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), protected against rotenone-induced PD.Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder, is a recurrent seizure caused by an abnormal discharge of cerebral neurons. At present, the existing antiepileptic medications have inadequate efficiency and are associated with several their adverse effects that limit their use. Thus, a key objective in epilepsy investigation is to identify new medications with greater efficacy as well as fewer toxicities. The disproportion between excitatory neurotransmitters (Glutamate (Glu)) and inhibitory neurotransmitters (γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)) is a leading element in epilepsy. Multiple studies demonstrated the enhancement of endogenous GABA signaling as well as exogenous GABA delivered to the brain, which could regulate and restore the excitation/inhibition imbalance to prevent seizures in the epileptic brain.GABA signaling includes GABA receptors, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADs) and GABA-transporters (GATs) mainly. Stimulation of GABA receptor leads to the opening of Cl channel, causing Cl− current to enter rapidly, leading to the hyperpolarization consequently preventing the over discharge. GABA receptors are allocated into GABAA, GABAB and GABAC, from which GABAA is utmost closely correlated to epilepsy. GADs, motivate synthesize of GABA, are encoded by two genes, GAD2 (GAD 65) and GAD1 (GAD 67). GATs specifically, GAT 1 and GAT 3 are expressed in nerve terminals and glia to remove GABA from the synaptic cleft.PTZ is regularly utilized to identify the neurobiology associated with epilepsy as well as to estimate the efficiency of novel treatments. Additionally, PC12 cells (pheochromocytoma cells) are generally considered as an in-vitro model for neurological diseases, including epilepsy. PC12 neuron-like cells promoted by nerve growth factor (NGF), which promote neuronal differentiation, and regeneration, are frequently used for examining nerve cell differentiation. Glu mediates excitatory neurotransmission and is involved in neural development and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, NGF-induced PC12 cells injured by Glu were chosen to explore neurological conditions in-vitro, such as epilepsy. NMDAR1, Glu receptor, is closely correlated with epilepsy, and over stimulation of NMDAR receptor is associated with epilepsy pathogenesis.The current study explored the anticonvulsant effect of Ger in-vitro using NGF-prompted PC12 cell injured by Glu and in-vivo using PTZ-induced seizures in mice through considering the GABAergic pathway.","Pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cells were provided by the cell culture unit of Holding Company for Biological Products and Vaccines (VACSERA), Egypt and maintained in RPMI medium mented with 5% horse serum, 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. PC12 cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. PC12 cells were treated with 50 ng/mL of NGF for 48 h for cell differentiation. NGF-induced PC12 cells without both Ger and Glu were considered as normal cells, whereas NG provoked PC12 cells injured by Glu (20 mmol/L) were considered as model cells.To estimate Geraniol (Ger) alone action on cell viability, Ger at different concentrations including 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL were added to cells, which were inoculated in 96-well plates for 24 h, and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h in 5% CO2. Subsequently, ten μL of CCK-8 solution were introduced to each well and maintained at 37 °C for 1 h then the absorbance was assessed at 450 nm.To assess the effect of Ger on NGF prompted PC12 cells injured by Glu viabilities, Ger at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 μg/mL for were added and cultured at 24 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, subjected to Glu (20 mmol/L) for another day to establish injure based upon the preliminary studies and previous studies. Then, ten μL of CCK-8 solution were added and maintained at 37 °C for 1 h followed by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm.Assessment of GABA, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors or serotonin (5-HT), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) content in PC12 Cells.NGF-induced PC12 cells were inoculated for 24 h, then Ger (100, and 200 μg/mL) was introduced and cultured for another day followed by Glu, which was cultured for 24 h. The media were collected, centrifuged, and kept at 80 °C. GABA, 5-HT, IL-1β, IL-4, and TNF-α levels were measured by ELISA kits.Total RNA of the NGF-induced PC12 cells was extracted following the producer’s directions. Two μg RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA using the Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. RT-PCR was performed using an ABI Step OnePlus System. The sequence of primers used is shown in Table 1. The gene expressions of GABAA-Rα1, NMDAR1, GAD 65, GAD 67, GAT 1 and GAT 3 were standardized to β-actin and analyzed by using 2−ΔΔCT method.Male Swiss albino mice (25 to 35 g) were secured from the Animal Research Centre, King Saud University, Riyadh, KSA and were continued with standard food and water in ventilated cages throughout the experiment. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of King Faisal University endorsed the study procedure (KFU-REC-2024-JUN-ETHICS1883).Forty Mice were haphazardly clustered into five groups (n = 8). Normal group in which mice were given saline (0.9%). PTZ group in which mice administered PTZ (35 mg/kg,14 ip injections, every other day). PTZ + Ger 100, PTZ + Ger 200 and PTZ + SV groups in which mice were administered Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) and sodium valproate (SV, 300 mg/kg) orally, respectively, and injected with PTZ. Mice were monitored for half an hour after PTZ injection to evaluate the seizure following Racine score. Mice displayed with stage 5 seizures on two continual PTZ doses were assumed to be entirely kindled and used in the behavioral tests as illustrated in Figure 1. Two-compartment avoidance device was used. The sessions occurred after 1 and 24 h of animals training to evaluate the animals short-term as well as long-term memory. On the behavioral test first day, animals were positioned in the white start compartment. After 5 second, the sliding door was raised to allow mice to go into the darkened chamber. Then, the door was closed for 20s, and the mice were kept there for habituation. After 30 minutes, the acquisition trial was conducted. Each mice was located in the light partition; after 5 s, the door was opened. As soon as the animal entered the dark chamber, the door was locked, and the foot shock (0.5 mA for 2 s) was provided. After twenty second, the mice were located in a temporary cage for attainment training. This test was recurred after two minutes. Mice had a foot shock each time it walked into the dark compartment with all its four paws. When the animal was kept in the light room for two minutes sequentially, the learning training was completed. All the animals learned the task with 2 maximum trials in the control group. On the second day, long-term memory was evaluated by a recovery test. Each mice was positioned in the illuminated compartment for twenty second, subsequently the door was opened, and the step-through latency was documented (up to 400 s) with no electric shocks were delivered to mice throughout that time. Mice suffering from cognitive deficits tends to enter the aversive stimuli zone.Y-maze test appraised the spatial short-term memory in PTZ tested animals as mentioned before in which arms entries no and the unplanned fluctuations were calculated. The device comprised three identical arms (A, B, C) arranged at 120° angles to form a Y-shape. On the last day of the study, 1 hour after different treatment administrations, mice were positioned separately in one of the three starting arms for 8 min for exploration. The number of arms entries and the spontaneous alternations were assessed. Spontaneous alternation is the repeated entrance into the 3 different Y-maze arms in any sequence. The spontaneous alternation percentage was assessed following this equation: .Novel object recognition was applied to appraise mice’s recognition memory as stated before. This test was accomplished using an open field with 40 cm length × 40 cm width × 25 cm high. The day before the last day of the experiment, mice were placed separately in the open field arena for five minutes for place familiarization. After 1 h of the last PTZ dose and for two days, both the acquisition and retention phases were performed. In the retention part, two identical objects (A and A) were offered to each mice for five minutes as an exploration session. Exploration is considered when the animal touches the object or point its nose less than 2 cm towards the object. On the subsequent day, one of the objects that was displayed throughout the acquisition phase was exchanged into a new entity (B) and each mice was permitted to inspect the two items (A+B) for five minutes as the day before. The time needed by each animal to recognize entity A or entity B was noted as tA and tB, respectively. Lastly, discrimination index (DI) was examined .Animals were located in the open field test (dimension: 40 cm length × 40 cm width × 45 cm high; divided into 16 smaller squares of equal (10 cm × 10 cm)) to assess the exploratory behavior, motor coordination, and locomotor ability. One-hour subsequent to the novel object recognition test, animals were submitted to the open field test. The number of lines crossed, rearing, grooming, and the time consumed in the center were documented.The motor coordination was estimated via the rotating rod to conclude the neuroprotective actions of Ger in PTZ administered animals as stated before. One hour after the open field test, each mice was placed on the rotating bar of the rotarod apparatus with a speed of 16 revolutions/minutes for 60 second to evaluate animal stability, which indicates the motor coordination of mice.Subsequent to the behavioral investigations, animals were sacrificed to separate the brains, which were washed with saline. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampus regions were obtained.Four μm hippocampal sections were obtained and stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Hippocampal sections were randomly chosen, photographed, appraised. The morphological changes in the neurons, such as cytoplasmic vacuolation, nuclear chromatin clumping, condensed cytoplasm, and fragmentation of cells, were examined by an independent pathologist to clarify the neuronal damage and scored as follows normal or no injury = 0; rare neuronal injury (< 5 clusters) = 1; occasional neuronal injury (5–15 clusters) = 2; frequent neuronal injury (> 15 clusters) = 3; diffused neuronal injury = 4 as mentioned before.GABA content (μg/g of tissue), GAD and γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) (both expressed as μg/min/mg of tissue) were assessed within the cortex and hippocampus homogenates.Glutathione (GSH, Cat. No. ab239727) content (mol/g of tissue), Catalase (CAT, Cat. No. ab118184) (mmol H2O2/min/g tissue) and superoxide dismutase (SOD, Cat. No. ab285309) activities and Malondialdehyde (MDA, Cat. No. ab238537) level, stated as µmol/g of tissue, were assessed using the specified ELISA kits obtained from Abcam Co., Eugene, OR, USA.In addition, NO, which induces various harmful situations known as nitrosative stress, was assessed using the Griess reagent.Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α, Cat. No. ab46070), interleukin-1β (IL-1β, Cat. No. ab100768), interferon-gamma (INF-γ, Cat. No. ab239425), and interleukin-6 (IL-6, Cat. No. ab100772), were calculated consuming specific ELISA kits attained from Abcam Co., USA.GFAP (Cat. No. ab233621), brain astrocyte activation indicator, and BDNF (Cat. No. ab213899) were analyzed using their relevant ELISA kits, which were secured from Abcam Co., USA.The hippocampus obtained from different groups was instantly frozen and stored to be designed for total RNA extraction, as mentioned before. The relative changes in gene expression were accomplished using the 2 - ΔΔCT method. The primers used are as follows GAT-1 (NM_178703.4) F: 5’-GAAAGCTGTCTGATTCT GAGGTG-3’, R: 3’-AGCAAACGAT GATGGAGTCCC-5’; GAT-3 (NM_172890.3) F: 5’- ATTATGTCT CCTGGCGGCCT3’, R: 3’- AAAAGATCTGCGTCCCAGCG-5’; Bcl-2 F: 5’-GTGGATGACTGAGTACC T −3′, R: 5′- CCAGGAGAAATCAAACAGAG −3′, Bax: F: 5’- CTACAGGGTTTCATCCAG −3′, R- 5′- CCA GTTCATCTCCAATTCG −3′; β actin F: 5’-ACGGCCAGGTCATCACTATTG-3’, R: 3’-CAAGAAGGAAG GCTGGAAAAGA.Protein was separated via SDS PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes, which were blocked, washed with TBS, incubated with the primary antibodies (1:2000 dilution) for 2 hours, followed by the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated, 1:5.000 dilution). The chemiluminescence developed from the luminol reagent was detected with the C-DiGit chemiluminescence scanner, and the band intensity was analyzed using the scanner software.Caspase- 3 (Cat. No. ab39401 and caspase 9 (Cat. No. ab65608) were evaluated in hippocampus homogenates using ELISA kits acquired from Abcam Co., USA.Numbers are revealed as mean ± SD. Graph Pad software was utilized to perform one-way ANOVA then Tukey–Kramer as a post hoc test for multiple comparisons using 0.05 level of probability as a significance level.","Ger at different concentrations up to 400 μg/mL did not display any toxicity or injury in PC12 cells as displayed in Figure 2A. Ger diminished the injury induced by Glu from concentrations of 100 to 500 μg/mL, when compared to the model cells (P < 0.001) indicating that Ger had a possible neuroprotective action against the Glu prompted damage in NGF-induced PC12 cells (Figure 2B). In subsequent experiments, the current study focused on these two efficient doses of Ger which are 100 and 200 μg/mL. To scrutinize the shielding action of Ger on NGF prompted PC12 cells damaged by Glu, gene expressions of GABAA-Rα1, NMDAR1, GAD 65, GAT 1, GAT 3 and GAD 67 were identified. The model cells showed elevated gene expressions of NMDAR1, GAT 1, and GAT 3 as well as diminished GABAA-Rα1, GAD 65 and GAD 67 expression (P < 0.001). On the other hand, Ger (100 and 200 μg/mL) considerably amplified GABAA-Rα1, GAD65 and GAD67 and decreased GAT 1, GAT 3 and NMDAR1 expressions relative to the model cells (Figure 2C–H).As revealed in Figure 3, GABA and 5-HT levels were substantially declined (P < 0.001) in model cells. In Ger-treated cells (100 and 200 μg/mL), GABA level was clearly amplified compared with the model cells. As for 5-HT, only Ger (200 μg/mL) instigated significant elevation related to the model cells. IL-1β, IL-4 and TNF-α were augmented in model cells, while Ger (100 and 200 μg/mL) considerably reduced them (P < 0001). No seizures were witnessed in the control group. Kindling (score 5/5) was attained after repetitive PTZ injections (35 mg/kg, 14 ip injections, every other day) showing Racine score of 5. Ger administration (100 or 200 mg/kg) with PTZ injections suppressed the development of kindling considerably (P < 0.001) as established by the reduction in seizure scores in correlation with the PTZ alone (Figure 4A). Repetitive seizures were associated with significant comorbidities, such as, learning and memory insufficiency. Kindling prompted by PTZ (35 mg/kg, 14 ip injections, every other day) drastically declined memory retrieval, which can be assessed by passive avoidance and Y maze tests. In passive avoidance tests, the latency to go in the dark room was considerably reduced in full-kindled animals, whereas Ger administration improved the latency to enter the dark room compared to the PTZ (P < 0.001) (Figure 4B). In the Y maze, kindling induction by PTZ considerably lessened the % of spontaneous alternations, reaching 28.17± 2.64% from 91.5 ± 4.73% in the normal group. Ger and SV increased spontaneous alternations percentage, reaching 38.98 ± 4.45%, 51.18 ± 2.35%, and 61 ± 2.56%, respectively, when related with the PTZ, as illustrated in Figure 4C. Similarly, arms entries escalated from 11.81 ± 1.85 in the PTZ administered animals to 24.73 ± 2.52, 31.06 ± 1.84, and 33.56 ± 1.82 in mice administered Ger and SV, respectively (Figure 4D). These outcomes suggest that Ger modified the memory impairments occurring in PTZ prompted kindling.PTZ amplified the exploration time of the familiar entity and diminished the exploration time of the novel entity as well as DI, as presented in Figure 4E and F. On the other hand, Ger considerably lowered the exploration time of the familiar entity and augmented the time of the novel entity and DI (Figure 4G).PTZ amplified the number of rearing and reduced the number of crossing and grooming and the center time in the open field, as depicted in Figure 4H and K. Whereas Ger-administered mice showed lowered number of rearing as well as increased number of crossings, grooming, and the center time in the open field. In addition, the period consumed on the rotating bar was considerably diminished in the PTZ-administered animals. An effect that was inverted by Ger and SV (Figure 4L).As GAD is one of the chief regulators in GABA synthesis and GAT-1 and GAT-3 are responsible for the regulation of extracellular GABA levels. Therefore, in the current study, GABA, GAD and GABA T were evaluated in hippocampus and cortex as well as GAT 1 and GAT 3 gene and protein expression were measured (Figure 5). In PTZ induced kindled animals, GABA and GAD were suppressed reaching a reduction percentage of 61.30% and 64.13% for GABA and in 70% and 62.97% for GAD in both hippocampus and cortex, respectively, whereas GABA T was increased in both hippocampus and cortex. These outcomes indicate that PTZ is associated with lowered GABA synthesis and availability in synapse. On the contrary, Ger significantly restored GABA level and GAD activity and lowered GABA T in both hippocampus and cortex as presented in Figure 5. Additionally, PTZ induced kindled animals, GAT 1 and 3 gene and protein expression were suppressed, whereas Ger significantly increased GAT 1 and 3 gene and protein expression as presented in Figure 6. PTZ induced a considerable escalation in the MDA level. However, management with Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) lessened MDA when linked with PTZ-group (Figure 7A and B). Likewise, NO levels were extensively amplified in PTZ. However, Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) and SV exhibited a substantial reduction in NO, causing a % reduction of 22.6%, 51.78%, and 60% in the hippocampus and 20.65%, 42.63% and 57.8% in the cortex, respectively (Figure 7C and D). Oral administration of Ger reversed the GSH insufficiency produced by PTZ, as illustrated in Figure 7E and F. PTZ produced a % decline of 66.45% and 60.9% in GSH in hippocampus and cortex respectively. Whereas Ger (100 and 200mg) amplified GSH in the hippocampus and cortex, when compared to PTZ. In the same way, PTZ prompted a % deficiency in the SOD and catalase activities in the hippocampus and cortex when compared with normal animals, while Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) augmented SOD catalase activities (Figure 7).PTZ alone administered to mice experienced a boost in IL-1ß. However, Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) exhibited an attenuation in IL-1β, attaining a percentage decline of 12.70% and 32.3% in the hippocampus and 21.47% and 34.53% in the cortex, respectively (Figure 8). Whereas Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) administration significantly lowered IL-6 levels. In the same way, TNF-α level was augmented by PTZ application alone when compared to the normal animals. PTZ administered mice that were treated with Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) exhibited a percentage decline of 20.49% and 36.92% (P < 0.001) in the hippocampus and 14.97%, and 37.53% (P < 0.05) in cortex, respectively, when related with PTZ alone group.Alike, PTZ animals displayed an elevation in IFN-γ in the hippocampus from 116.03 ± 7.67 pg/mL in normal group to 307.08 ± 11.9 pg/mL in PTZ given mice and in the cortex from 101.54 ± 8.57 pg/mL in normal animals to 281.75 ± 8.46 pg/mL in the PTZ group. On the other hand, Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) exhibited a percentage decline of 18.55% and 40.31% (P < 0.001) in the hippocampus and 19.54%, and 39.56% (P < 0.001) in cortex, respectively.GFAP and BDNF levels were presented in Figure 9A and B. PTZ- group exposed a noteworthy upsurge in GFAP levels, indicating astrocyte triggering, and a diminishing in BDNF protein levels. On the contrary, Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) administration significantly lowered GFAP by 16.63% and 30.54%, respectively, and increased BDNF levels by 46.55% and 86.02%, respectively, in the hippocampus. PTZ increased caspase-3 and −9 levels and Bax gene expression and diminished Bcl2 gene expression (Figure 9). Alternatively, Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly reduced caspase-3 and −9 levels and Bax gene expression and escalated Bcl2 gene expression.The hippocampal CA1 region in PTZ kindling mice displayed fragmented, contracted, and pyknotic neurons complemented with perineuronal edema, which presented apparent regular hippocampal layers. Ger-administered animals exhibited inferior neural degenerative as well as intercellular edema with a decline in the scoring when compared to the PTZ group (Figure 10). ","Several plant extracts that contain Ger were assessed for anticonvulsant activity such as Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt (Poaceae) leaf essential oil and Ocimum basilicum leaf essential oil, hydro-alcoholic extract of R. damascena and Cymbopogon citratus Stapf leaves essential oil and hydroalcoholic extract in zebra fish. However, robust is known about the anticonvulsant effect of Ger alone. Therefore, the current study tried to scrutinize the antiepileptic effect of Ger using both in-vitro via NGF-prompted PC12 cell injured by Glu and in-vivo models via PTZ-induced seizures in mice through with regard to the GABAergic pathway.The neuron-like PC12 cell is extensively utilized to develop neuroprotective agents and identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. Ger reduced the injury induced by Glu, indicating that Ger had a possible defensive action in Glu prompted injury in PC12 cells. The next step was to explore GABA signaling pathway. In brain tissues, the GABA accessibility is synchronized by GABA synthesizing glutamate decarboxylases (GAD65 and GAD67) activity, the GABA degrading GABA aminotransferase (GABAT), and the GABA transport proteins (GAT1–3 and BGT-1). Loss-of-function mutations in GABAAR genes are an essential mechanism in the pathophysiology of familial idiopathic generalized epilepsy. GABAAR α-subunit changes play a significant role in the process of epileptogenesis. GAT 1 and GAT 3, as GATs, are expressed in nerve terminals and glia to remove GABA from the synaptic cleft in the brain, and lack of expression of GATs would enhance the ability of GABA to spread through the extracellular space. In PTZ-induced kindling was associated with an upregulated gene expression of GAT-1 and GAT-3 indicating that PTZ might affect GABA homeostasis by regulating the GABA transporters. GAD65−/− mice develop spontaneous seizures associated with increased mortality, whereas GAD67−/− mice showed a 93% reduction in GABA concentration in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, clinical confirmations further showed that lowered GAD activity is associated with several forms of epilepsy.The results showed Ger (100 and 200 μg/mL) amplified the gene expressions of GABAA-Rα1, GAD65 and GAD67 and decreased GAT 1, GAT 3 and NMDAR1 expression in NGF prompted PC12 cells damaged by Glu. Additionally, GABA and 5-HT levels were increased in Ger-treated cells (100 and 200 μg/mL). These outcomes signify that Ger escalates the GABA signaling pathway, which is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter.Regarding inflammatory mediators, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-1β contents were increased in NGF prompted PC12 cells damaged by Glu whereas Ger reduced these inflammatory cytokines by demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effect.The in-vitro outcomes achieved displayed that PTZ chronic administration caused a intense alteration of memory. These effects are in line with preceding outcomes that disclosed that PTZ induced kindling in mice disturbs short-term as well as long-term memory. The Y-maze and the novel object recognition task are extensively applied to recognize the implication of diverse brain areas in cognitive abilities. The passive avoidance test estimates the capability of the animal to learn and to maintain an associative rule. In the current study, Ger increased the percentage of spontaneous alternations suggesting that it may protect mice from memory impairment. Also, Ger mitigated PTZ prompted spatial and recognition memory deficiency signifying anti-amnesic effects of Ger in epileptic animals. Moreover, the outcomes of the open field and rotarod tests propose that locomotion, exploratory behavior and motor coordination are enhanced by Ger in PTZ kindled mice. Earlier studies showed that Ger abated SPS-induced locomotor and memory diminishing, as well as behavioral despair in SPS-induced PTSD. Also, Ger improved passive avoidance memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits in Alzheimer’s disease and enriched neuronal construction and spatial memory in D-galactose (D-gal) generated cognitive diminishing.In the current study, Ger diminished PTZ induced escalations in GABA-transaminase activity and reductions GABA, GAD and GABA receptor in hippocampus and cortex. These effects advocate that Ger has anticonvulsant, antiepileptogenic, as well as anti-amnesic properties via affecting GABAergic pathway.Formerly, Ger increased DA, 5-HT concentrations and GAD enzyme activity in SPS-induced PTSD. Also, Ger showed antipruritic abilities of on acute and chronic itch via modifying spinal GABA/GRPR signaling. A prior study investigated the neuroprotective actions of C. citratus essential oil and hydroalcoholic extract, as well as of its correlated ingredients citral and geraniol in PTZ provoked seizures in zebrafish. The increase in the latency time for the first seizure, was reduced when zebrafish were pretreated with Flumazenil, signifying the contribution of GABAA receptor in the anticonvulsant actions of Ger in zebrafish.Oxidative stress is another contributor in the pathogenesis of seizures. The existing study exposed that PTZ persuaded oxidative stress, manifested as provoked MDA and NO levels and reduced GSH level, and CAT and SOD activities. Whereas Ger inhibited NO and lipid peroxidation as well as increased GSH level and CAT and SOD activities, proposing that Ger protected brain cells against the destructive actions of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Previous studies revealed that Ger exhibited antioxidant effects through which it exerted neuroprotective potential in the cerebral I/R injury, acrylamide, and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, Ger efficiently amended aging-related memory weakening through intensifying GSH, BDNF, Ach levels, and SOD activity in D-gal prompted cognitive diminishing.Another participant involved in the epilepsy pathophysiology is the neuroinflammatory response to epileptogenic insults. PTZ-induced kindling triggered neuroinflammatory response causing an elevation in the brain cytokines. Remarkably, Ger prevented the escalation in brain cytokines prompted by PTZ implying that Ger exerts anti-inflammatory properties in epileptic mice. Previous reports revealed that Ger exhibited anti-inflammatory against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammation, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) instigated in liver fibrosis, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis. As for neurological actions, Ger exhibited anti-inflammatory potential against SPS-induced PTSD. Prior studies revealed the molecular mechanisms of the potent anti-inflammatory effect of Ger. For instance, Ger protected against traumatic SCI by downregulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways in SCI rats. A another study demonstrated that in Ox-LDL-stimulated HUVECs, Ger suppressed the nuclear translocation and activity of NF-ᴋB as well as phosphorylation of IkBα. Also, Ger effectively reduces the expression of COX-2, mPGES-1 (produces PGE2), PTGDS (produces PGD2) and MMP-1 expressions in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory arthritis (IA) in rats.Both oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory are associated with apoptosis. In the current, Ger reduced caspase-3, and −9 levels and Bax gene expression and escalated Bcl2 gene expression, indicating deterring PTZ associated apoptosis. Similarly, Ger relieved LPS-induced acute lung damage via deterring lung inflammation and apoptosis. Also, Ger defended against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in liver I/R damage.In the existing study, SV was administered as a positive control in PTZ kindling-induced seizures. SV associated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and neuronal damage-preventing effects in mice were due to its ability in preventing seizures and subsequent lower neuronal damage and therefore lesser oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis occurring in the animals’ brains. On the other hand, valproic acid alone can be used to induce brain damage and autism-like symptoms in animals, and in zebra fish.The limitations of the current study include the lack of pharmacokinetics and bioavailability experiments for Ger in the CNS and the absence of cell death-specific assays such as TUNEL assay.","Outcomes of the existing study showed that Ger protects animals against PTZ prompted kindling as established by the enhancement in short term as well as the long-term memory. Ger activated GABAergic neurotransmission, which might elucidate its anticonvulsant effect. Furthermore, Ger reduced the oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in PTZ kindled animals.The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of King Faisal University allowed the experimental protocol (KFU-REC-2023-SEP-ETHICS1321). All the experiments were accomplished in agreement with the relevant procedures and regulations of the Ethical Conduct for the Use of Animals in Research at King Faisal University."
9,TA039874,10.1186/s12967-024-05168-w,Blockade of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by Astragaloside IV attenuates ulcerativecolitis via improving the intestinal epithelial barrier.,"BACKGROUND: The specific pathogenesis of UC is still unclear, but it has beenclear that defects in intestinal barrier function play an important role in it.There is a temporary lack of specific drugs for clinical treatment. AstragalosideIV (AS-IV) is one of the main active ingredients extracted from Astragalus rootand is a common Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinaldiseases. This study aimed to determine whether AS-IV has therapeutic value forDSS or LPS-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in vivo and in vitroand its potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The intestinal tissues from UCpatients and colitis mice were collected, intestinal inflammation was observed bycolonoscopy, and mucosal barrier function was measured by immunofluorescencestaining. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activator YS-49 and inhibitor LY-29 wereadministered to colitic mice to uncover the effect of this pathway on gut mucosalbarrier modulation. Then, network pharmacology was used to screen AstragalosideIV (AS-IV), a core active component of the traditional Chinese medicineAstragalus membranaceus. The potential of AS-IV for intestinal barrier functionrepairment and UC treatment through blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway was furtherconfirmed by histopathological staining, FITC-dextran, transmission electronmicroscopy, ELISA, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and western blotting. Finally,16 S rRNA sequencing was performed to uncover whether AS-IV can ameliorate UC byregulating gut microbiota homeostasis. RESULTS: Mucosal barrier function wassignificantly damaged in UC patients and murine colitis, and the activatedPI3K/AKT signaling pathway was extensively involved. Both in vivo and vitroshowed that the AS-IV-treated group significantly relieved inflammation andimproved intestinal epithelial permeability by inhibiting the activation of thePI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In addition, microbiome data found that gutmicrobiota participates in AS-IV-mediated intestinal barrier recovery as well.CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that AS-IV exerts a protective effect on theintegrality of the mucosal barrier in UC based on the PI3K/AKT pathway, and AS-IVmay serve as a novel AKT inhibitor to provide a potential therapy for UC.","Zhang, Xinhui, Zhang, Fan, Li, Yan, Fan, Na, Zhao, Ke, Zhang, Anding, Kang, Jiefang, Lin, Yan, Xue, Xiaochang, Jiang, Xun",2024,Journal of translational medicine,2,False,False,True,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic non-specific inflammatory disease of the colorectum of unknown etiology, mostly located in the sigmoid colon and rectum, with lesions generally confined to the mucosal and submucosal layers. The occurrence of UC may be due to genetic predisposition, immune dysfunction, intestinal microecological dysregulation, and altered environmental factors, among others. In the 21st century, UC has become one of the major challenges in global public health. In Europe and North America, the number of patients exceeds 1.5 million and 2 million, respectively, and the prevalence in regions such as Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa is continuously increasing.Patients with UC tend to present with intestinal reactions with varying degrees of systemic symptoms, particularly disturbed bowel habits, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and mucopurulent bloody stools. Although abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in stools are not life-threatening complications perse, they are associated with decreased quality of life, and the ensuing damage to the colonic mucosal barrier, and imbalance of intestinal flora are much more serious problems. The mucosal epithelium, as a natural protective barrier of the intestinal tract, not only regulates the selective permeability of the intestinal epithelial cells for material transport, but also prevents pathogenic antigens in the intestinal lumen, such as endotoxin, viruses, bacteria, and their metabolites, from entering into the intrinsic layer of the mucosa. When the intestinal tract is under an inflammatory state, the intestinal epithelial barrier will lose the normal transport and defense function, and harmful substances continuously enter the internal environment of the intestine, leading to excessive activation of the immune response, further damaging the intestinal barrier, and ultimately resulting in a series of inflammatory manifestations both inside and outside the intestine. Based on the development of disease understanding, the current therapeutic goal for UC has changed from controlling inflammation and relieving clinical symptoms to promoting intestinal mucosal repair, a great goal that not only reduces the use of hormonal drugs and surgical treatments but also dramatically improves the long-term prognosis and enhances the quality of patients’ lives.As above mentioned, dysregulation of the intestinal mucosal barrier is an important feature of UC disease, and this phenomenon is usually attributed to protein kinase B (AKT1), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), transcription factor 4 (TCF-4), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and so on. AKT is a protein kinase B with serine and threonine kinase activity, and its role is mainly related to the information linkage activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) initiation. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regulates the activation of inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators and has a clear intervention role in UC immune inflammation. NF-κB is an important intracellular nuclear transcription factor that participates in the body’s inflammatory response, and immune response, and regulates apoptotic and stress response. Christian F et al. found that the NF-κB signaling pathway in UC and colitis-associated colon cancer mice models was increased, which will lead to pathological changes in the UC intestine and trigger positive feedback for further NF-κB activation and exacerbated inflammation. The Wnt pathway plays a crucial role in the intestinal epithelium, especially in regulating the behavior, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of stem cells. Reduced Wnt pathway, especially the specific defect in TCF-4 expression induces deficiencies in Paneth cell defensins, which is one of the major factors in the pathogenesis of UC. The Notch signaling pathway is involved in the differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells and promotes the expression of tight junction proteins. The aberrant activation of the Notch pathway induces an increase in the expression of the HES1 transcription factor in human colon cell lines, thereby inhibiting the differentiation of the secretory cell lineage and weakening the mucus barrier. In addition, it also promotes inflammatory responses and accelerates the disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier through activation of macrophage activation. It is worth noting that in the above UC-related signaling pathway, we found that there are some important discrepancies seen in studies about the PI3K/AKT signal pathway. Firstly, while most studies suggest that PI3K/AKT signaling becomes overactive under colitis conditions, a few studies report reduced activities of PI3K/AKT in colitis animals. Secondly, it is in the preliminary research stage about clinically administrable chemical inhibitors and/or agonists for PI3K/ AKT at present. Thus, there is an urgent need to elucidate and validate the real function of the PI3K/AKT1 signal pathway in IBD.Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is a terpenoid extracted from Astragalus membranaceus, which is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine therapy and health care for its various pharmacological effects such as immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant, anti-tumor, and hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that AS-IV is extensively involved in the barrier function regulation of various diseases and the regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. AS-IV has been reported to have a significant protective effect on human glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) by inhibiting AKT activation and increasing GSK activation in the form of GSK3α, which promotes glucose uptake in GEnCs and enhances energy metabolism to participate in the protection of the filtration barrier in GEnCs. AS-IV prevents tight junctions (TJs) disruption and intestinal barrier damage by inhibiting activation of RhoA/NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle signaling in an in vivo cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis model and an in vitro Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed Caco-2 monolayer barrier model. AS-IV promotes the phosphorylation level of AKT, inhibits GSK-3β activity, leads to nuclear translocation and accumulation of β-catenin, improves cell viability, and promotes the expression of TJ proteins and wound healing to alleviate Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)-associated intestinal dysfunction. Given that AS-IV plays an important role in the repair of barrier function in vivo, we sought to explore the potential impact of the administration of AS-IV on barrier function in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice, and whether PI3K/AKT plays a role in it.In this study about UC, we worked to investigate the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in intestinal inflammation, and the pharmacological activities of AS-IV such as anti-inflammatory and the repair of the intestinal epithelium. Simultaneously, we explored whether AS-IV acts as a potential ligand of PI3K/AKT. Finally, the potential microbial-dependent mechanism of AS-IV was also probed.","Astragaloside IV was purchased from Dalian Meilun Co., Ltd.

Intestinal mucosal specimens were collected with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Tangdu Hospital, while patients were informed of the details and signed an informed consent form.C57BL/6 mice (male, 6–8 weeks old, 20–23 g body weight) were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Air Force Medical University (Xi’an, China). Animals were acclimatized and fed for one week before the experiment under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, with the temperature controlled at 22 ± 2 °C, while being given a 12-h light/dark cycle. All experiments involving animals complied with the regulations of the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments of Air Force Medical University.The animal experiments in this study were divided into three parts: In the first part, mice were divided into two groups: control and DSS groups. The control group was given normal drinking water and the DSS group was given drinking water containing 2.5%DSS for 7 d. In the second part, mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, DSS, LY29, and YS49 groups. Drinking water containing 2.5%DSS was provided to the DSS and LY29 groups for 7 d, and the other two groups were given normal drinking water. During the period, LY29(5 mg/kg) and YS49(5 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally once into the LY29 or YS49 group every day respectively. In the third part, mice were divided into 4 groups: control, DSS, AS-IV treatment, and 5-ASA treatment groups. Except for the control group mice were provided with normal drinking water, the other groups of mice were given 2.5% DSS drinking water for 7 d. Mice in all groups were given normal drinking water from day 8 to day 10. All group mice gavage therapy was administered once a day from day 0 to 10. Mice in the AS-IV and 5-ASA treatment groups were gavaged 100 mg/kg AS-IV and 150 mg/kg 5-ASA respectively, and the control group and DSS group were gavaged 0.5% CMC-Na solution (solvent for AS-IV and 5-ASA). Each group of the three-part animal experiments contained 10 mice. We defined the starting point of the animal experiment as day 0 and recorded the weight and stool of the untreated mice. After the molding was done, all mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (ip, 50 mg/kg) before sampling.Body weight, diarrhea, and blood in stool were recorded at the same time each day during the modeling process, and the disease activity index (DAI) was scored. At the end of the modeling period, feces and blood were collected from the mice. The colon was photographed and recorded, collected 1 cm from the end of the anus, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, the remaining tissue was stored at -80 °C for RNA and protein extraction.Anesthetized mice with 1% pentobarbital sodium (ip, 50 mg/kg). Colonoscopy with a high-resolution mouse video endoscopic system (KARL STORZ, Tuttlingen, Germany) was used to inflate the colon with air and observe on mice’s colon.After the animal model was completed, 3 mice were fetched randomly in each group. Every mouse was gavaged FITC-Dextran (40 mg/kg) after 8 h of fasting, and the abdomen was exposed carefully after 6 h to observe the distribution of FITC-Dextran in intestinal tissues using a small animal imaging system (Boloteng, Guangzhou, China). Meanwhile, the serum was separated to detect the fluorescence intensity after collecting the blood, and the concentration of FITC-Dextran in the serum was calculated by plotting a standard curve according to the instructions.The colon of mice was obtained for pathological analysis. Colon tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h and embedded in paraffin, sliced (thickness 5 μm), and attached to a high adhesion slide, numbered, overnight at 37℃. The section was stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and alisin blue-periodic schiff (AB-PAS).Fresh colonic tissues were cut into 1-2mm3 blocks and fixed in glutaraldehyde fixative (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) for 2 h, resin embedding after alcohol gradient dehydration. Specimens were cut into semi-thin Sect. (0.5 μm) and ultrathin Sects. (70–90 nm) and observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM 109, Zeiss, Jena, Germany).The human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) is similar in structure and function to differentiated small intestinal epithelial cells, with microvilli and enzymes associated with small intestinal brush epithelium, and can be used to simulate intestinal transport in vivo. Caco-2 cells from ATCC/LGC Standards GmbH (HTB-37, Wesel, Germany) were cultured with MEM medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 cell culture incubator. AS-IV was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for treatment of Caco-2 cells and the final concentration of DMSO was kept less than 0.1% (v/v). Caco-2 cells (1 × 104 cells) were inoculated in 96-well plates and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to confluent, followed by stimulation with LPS (100 µg/ml) and AS-IV (150 µM) for 24 h. Then 10 µl/well CCK-8 (Yeasen Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h further. Finally, absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).Frozen sections of colons were fixed in acetone for 20 min and blocked with 10% goat serum for 1.5 h. The Caco-2 cells crawling piece was fixed with 4% PFA. After that, the slides were incubated with anti-ZO-1 (1:200), anti-occludin (1:250), or anti-villin antibody (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, sections were incubated with anti-mouse IgG (Alexa Fluor® 488 Conjugate) and anti-rat IgG (Cy3 Conjugate) in the dark at room temperature for 60 min, followed by incubation with 30 µL DAPI for 10 min. Finally, sections were observed using a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan).RNA was extracted from colon tissue and Caco-2 cells by TRIzol, and reverse transcription (Takara, Japan) and real-time PCR (Vayme, China) were performed according to the instructions of the kit. All primer sequences were synthesized by Sangon Biothen Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and the primer sequences are shown in Table S1. All qRT-PCR analyses were carried out with a 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The amplification protocol was as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 35 s, 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 95 °C for 15 s. The relative fold change in expression was finally calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method. All samples were assayed in triplicate and expression levels of mRNA were normalized using the endogenous control β-actin.Blood samples were collected from the mice and left for 1–2 h at room temperature. Then, 150–300 µl serum was obtained by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 20 min. The culture medium of Caco-2 cells stimulated with LPS and AS-IV in a 12-well plate for 24 h was collected with a centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. Cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α were detected using ELISA kits (Shanghai Enzyme Union, Shanghai, China) in the serum or cell culture supernatant according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Capture antibodies (1:200) were coated in the plate overnight at 4℃. After blocking, samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with detection antibodies (1:200) for 1 h. Subsequently, streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was added, and the substrate was added 30 min later. Finally, the absorbance value was detected using a microplate reader. The concentrations of cytokines were obtained according to the standard curves.Intestinal tissues and cells were collected and fully lysed with the pre-cooled RIPA mixture + 1% PMSF + 1% phosphatase inhibitor. The supernatant was collected with centrifugation. Protein concentration was then determined using BCA quantification (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany), and heated at 100 °C for 10 min added 5x loading buffer. After being separated by electrophoresis using a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Then, the PVDF membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder for 2 h at room temperature, and incubated with specific primary antibodies against EpCAM, Occludin, AKT1, p-AKT1(Ser473), PI3K, and p-PI3K (Tyr458) and secondary antibodies at 4 °C. Images were captured using a chemiluminescence imager (Tanon 5200, Shanghai, China), and quantitatively analyzed using the ImageJ software.AKT1 protein complex PDB file (PDB ID: 7NH5) from RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/), the potential active site residues are obtained from the site finder module of the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software and protein plus (https://proteins.plus/). This operation establishes the structure-function relationship of the predicted AKT1 protein complex and identifies potential binding regions of antagonists or agonists. AS-IV (Compound CID: 13,943,297), Formononetin (Compound CID: 5,280,378), and Kaempferol (Compound CID: 5,280,863) structure information is from the PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). For the optimization of receptor and ligand molecules, hydrogenation and energy minimization are performed using MOE software. The DOCK module in MOE software is used for molecular docking, and the docking method is Induced Fi. To eliminate false positive results, we restricted the docking score of AS-IV and AKT1 to less than − 5.0 kcal/mol. Pymol was used to further display the docking results and analyze the interactions.Relevant targets of AS-IV were collected from Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP, http://tcmspw.com/ tcmsp.php/) and Swiss target prediction databases (http://www.Swisstargetprediction.ch/) based on oral bioavailability (OB) ≥ 30% and drug-likeness (DL) ≥ 0.18. The Gene Cards database (https://www.genecards.org/) and Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org/) were used to search for UC-related target genes. Then, all the selected targets were imported into Cytoscape software to establish the active drug and disease target networks.To find the core targets for AS-IV intervention in UC, the STRING database (https://string-db.org/) was used to establish a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of active drugs and common targets of diseases. The obtained data were imported into Venn diagram webtool (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) and Cytoscape software to be analyzed and screened for possible core targets (the higher the degree indicates that the target is more important in this PPI network).To elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms of AS-IV for UC, we imported the common targets into the DAVID database (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) and performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF) were involved in it, and the results were filtered by P Value<0.05.Colon fecal contents were collected, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. Total genomic DNA was extracted from fecal contents using QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA). Concentration of DNA was verified with NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Ltd.) and agarose gel electrophoresis. Then, 16S rRNA gene was amplified using hypervariable 3–4 (V3–V4) region-targeted barcoded universal bacterial primers, F: 5’-ACTCCTACGGGGAGGC AGCA-3’ and R: 5’-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’ with the PCR system containing 25 µL of 2 × Premix Taq, 1.0 µL of each primer (10 µM), 50 ng of template DNA, and nuclease-free water added to 50 µL. PCR was conducted with an initial denaturation for 94 °C 5 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C 30 s, annealed at 52 °C 30 s, elongated at 72 °C 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C 10 min on a thermocycler PCR system (Bio-Rad QX200 system, California, USA). The DNA library was built with NEBNext® UltraII DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, USA), and sequenced on the Illumina Nova 6000 platform (Guangzhou, China) in PE250 mode.Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, USA) and is presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test between two groups and a one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s post hoc tests when groups were more than two. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.","The patients who were diagnosed with acute stage UC and had diarrhea, pain, and bloody stools were selected as study subjects. Colon mucosal congestion, edema with erosion, ulceration, bleeding spots on the intestinal mucosa, and the ulcer surface with white moss were observed under the colonoscope (the colon mucosa of healthy objects is smooth, with a clear vascular texture, and there is no erosion, ulceration, or bleeding) (Fig. 1A). Surgical resected colon tissues were collected from the subjects, and the intestinal barrier function was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Results showed that the expression of Villin, ZO-1, and Occludin, classical TJs-related proteins, on the inflamed colonic tissues was significantly decreased compared with that in normal control (Fig. 1B-C), indicating that gut barrier integrity is disrupted in the inflamed colonic tissues in UC patients. We wonder whether this phenomenon also exists in the murine colitis model. Therefore, C57BL/6 mice were fed with 2.5% DSS solution, and body weights, DAI scores, colon lengths, and colonoscope intestinal luminal manifestations were recorded and evaluated in conjunction with pathologic scores for the successful construction of a mouse model of colitis (Fig. 1D-J). Considering increased intestinal permeability is the main manifestation of mucosal barrier disruption and one of the basic features of UC, FITC-Dextran was orally administered to the colitic mice, and fluorescence intensity was detected in colonic tissues and sera. As shown in Fig. 1K, FITC-Dextran was widely distributed throughout the intestinal tissues up to the anus in the colitic mice as compared with the control mice. In addition, obvious rupture of the TJs structure of the epithelial cells and atrophy of the villi of the intestinal wall were observed under transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1L). Consistently, the immunofluorescence results showed a significant reduction in the expression of intestinal TJs proteins Villin, ZO-1, and Occludin (Fig. 1M-N). These data collectively demonstrated that gut barrier integrity is disrupted and intestinal permeability is increased in the inflamed colonic tissues of UC patients and UC mice.As above mentioned, various signaling pathways have been reported to be extensively involved in UC occurrence and progression, and the PI3K/AKT axis participates in regulating the barrier function of various tissues in the human body, especially in intestinal barrier regulation. Whereas the conclusions are often contradictory, the real role and the detailed mechanisms of the PI3K/AKT axis in UC are still largely unknown. To clarify the effects of PI3K/AKT on UC, the activator YS49 is administered to normal mice, and the inhibitor LY29 is administered to DSS-induced colitis mice (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B-F, YS-49 alone significantly reduced body weight (Fig. 2B), elevated DAI (Fig. 2C), shortened colon tissues (Fig. 2D-E), and increased intestinal permeability (Fig. 2F) of the C57BL/6 mice as compared with the control mice (P < 0.05), although not so significantly changed as DSS-treated mice (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001). Notably, LY29 remarkably inhibited DSS-induced colitis in mice as indicated by the recovered weight loss, colon length, DAI, and gut mucosa barrier. These data suggested that PI3K/AKT signal pathway activation damages intestinal barrier integrity and aggravates UC in mice. Then, we further confirmed this effect in intestinal epithelial-derived Caco-2 cells. Results showed that LPS stimulation greatly accelerated TJ disruption between Caco-2 cells via suppressing the expressions of ZO-1 and Occludin, which was potently restored in the presence of LY29 (Fig. 2G-H), indicating PI3K/AKT axis activation is essential for intestinal barrier damage.Considering PI3K/AKT might be a potential target for UC treatment, molecular docking modeling was used to screen “AKT1 inhibitors” from dozens of compounds extracted from traditional Chinese medicine. Among them, AS-IV, kaempferol, and formononetin were found to have a relatively high affinity to AKT1. AS-IV is the most binding compound, the calculated binding energy is -12.596 kcal/mol, and four covalent bonds (Glu191, Lys276, Glu278, and Asp292) are possibly formed to tightly bind to AKT1 (Fig. 3A). Although we reported previously that AS-IV ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in mice via promoting macrophages M2 polarization, the direct target and detailed mechanism of AS-IV is almost completely unknown. Therefore, network pharmacology was used to explore the complex mechanisms of AS-IV in UC. The TCMSP and Swiss target prediction databases were utilized to collect targets corresponding to AS-IV, and a total of 28 drug targets were obtained (Fig. 3B). Disease targets were screened using the Gene Cards database, and the relevance of the targets to the disease was evaluated by relevance score, where we screened a total of 4917 disease targets with relevance. Then the Venny data visualization tool was used to screen the drug-disease co-targets and draw Venny plots, and a total of 14 potential drug-disease combination targets were obtained (Fig. 3C-D). To further analyze the core targets of AS-IV in UC, the relevant data were imported into the STRING database and Cytoscape software to establish and analyze the PPI network, and the centrality of the nodes was analyzed by betweenness centrality (BC), closeness centrality (CC), and degree centrality (DC), and 11 meaningful targets were filtered out (Fig. 3E-F). Among them, AKT1 is the target gene with the highest number of nodes. Then KEGG and GO enrichment analysis of the above common targets was performed using the David database. Suggesting that AS-IV is involved in many biological processes in UC (Fig. 3G), including positive regulation of protein kinase B signaling and positive regulation of cell proliferation, the regulation of cellular components mainly focuses on the cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleoplasm, and also plays a role by regulating molecular functions such as ATP binding, identical protein binding, and protein kinase activity. KEGG signaling pathway analysis showed that AS-IV was associated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, proteoglycans and pathways in cancer, chemical carcinogenesis-receptor activation, endocrine resistance, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was also highly correlated (Fig. 3H). PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (p-value = 1.40E-04, gene count = 6) was the most widely studied in UC and AKT1 was the key hub with the highest node degree in the PPI network. Combined with the above results and related literature hints, AS-IV may play a role in UC by regulating the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT.As shown in Fig. 4A-C, E-H, the colitis mice after AS-IV intervention had less weight loss, lower DAI and pathology scores, and attenuated colonic length shortening as compared with the model mice. Meanwhile, the treatment of 5-ASA, which is identified as the routine medicine for IBD, was considered as the positive control. The AS-IV group showed smoother intestinal wall mucosa, improved congestion, and edema, and no obvious ulceration and bleeding spots compared to the DSS group under colonoscopy (Fig. 4D). In addition, both the mRNA and protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were significantly suppressed in colon tissues and sera (Fig. 4I-J). The effects of AS-IV on UC were further identified in an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) inflammation model established by treating Caco-2 cells with LPS. As shown in Fig. 4 K, LPS stimulation significantly inhibited IEC viability, which was potently reversed in the presence of AS-IV. In addition, LPS induced strong proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and TNF-α transcription (Fig. 3L) and expression (Fig. 3M) in IEC, while AS-IV treatment greatly suppressed this effect. Thus, AS-IV plays an anti-inflammation role in the murine colitis model.Subsequently, we assessed the effects of AS-IV on the intestinal permeability and mucosal barrier function in each group of the mice, results showed that the colons were significantly less permeable to FITC-Dextran after AS-IV intervention (Fig. 5A-B), and the disruption of the intestinal villi was alleviated under the transmission electron microscope, which was more neatly and densely arranged and tightly connected structures (Fig. 5C). AB-PAS staining was then performed on the colonic tissues of the mice, and results showed that AS-IV was able to alleviate the erosion of intestinal epithelium, crypt damage, and loss of mucus-secreting goblet cells induced by DSS (Fig. 5D-E). When the mRNA level of the TJs barrier-associated genes such as Occludin, Muc2, ZO-1, Villin, Claudin-2, Claudin-5, and Claudin-7 in the inflamed colonic tissues was detected by qRT-PCR, we found that the negative TJs regulatory gene Claudin-2 was suppressed, whereas the other positive TJs regulatory genes were significantly upregulated by AS-IV (Fig. 5F). In addition, immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate mucosal barrier TJs in the colon. Results showed that the expression of Villin, Occludin, and ZO-1 were all increased in the AS-IV group (Fig. 5G-H). These aforementioned data collectively suggested that AS-IV ameliorated murine colitis by improving the intestinal mucosa barrier function. Similar data were obtained in Caco-2 cells in which LPS stimulated significantly decreased, whereas AS-IV intervention increased the production of intestinal mucosa barrier-associated genes (Fig. 5I). Thus, AS-IV can directly regulate IEC-mediated gut barrier maintenance in the colitic mice.Although we predicted that AS-IV may directly target the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, it is still unknown whether AS-IV regulated intestinal barrier function via this AKT molecule, and how about the effect of AS-IV on AKT activation. To clarify these problems, we detected the levels of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT1, and p-AKT1 in colitis mice, and results showed that DSS stimulation strongly induced PI3K/AKT activation as indicated by the elevated phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT1. However, AS-IV significantly inhibited this effect (Fig. 6A-B). In addition, both the TJs-associated Occludin and adhesion junction-associated EpCAM were reversely changed (Fig. 6C-D), suggesting that AS-IV regulates the intestinal barrier via blocking PI3K/AKT activation. To confirm this, Caco-2 cells were treated as indicated and immunofluorescence was carried out to detect the changes of ZO-1 and Occludin, we found that LPS greatly inhibited ZO-1 and Occludin expression on Caco-2 cells, which can be restored by AS-IV. However, this effect of AS-IV was almost completely shielded by the PI3K/AKT activator YS-49 as exhibited by the downregulated ZO-1 and Occludin production (Fig. 6E-F). Therefore, we concluded that AS-IV regulates intestinal barrier maintenance in colitis via inhibiting PI3K/AKT activation.Based on the therapeutic effect of AS-IV on colitis, we wonder whether AS-IV can regulate IECs and gut microbiota simultaneously as both of them play pivotal roles in colitis-associated inflammation and intestinal barrier disruption. Therefore, we analyzed the fecal samples by 16 S rRNA identification in the V3-V4 region, and the results showed that the bacterial species richness and diversity in feces in the AS-IV–-treated group were significantly increased compared to the control. The depth of sequencing of the OTUs of the Venny diagram covered all common species in the samples, and the overlap of the four groups represented the common OTUs, totaling 375, and group-specific OTUs of 203, 148, 250, and 116, respectively (Fig. 7A). In ecology, α diversity is commonly used to measure the diversity of intra-individuals. By analyzing α diversity associated with OTU levels, such as Chao1, ACE, and Shannon indices, gut microbial was significantly reduced in the DSS group. However, the α diversity of the fecal microbial community in the AS-IV groups was restored after treatment with pharmacological interventions (Fig. 7B-D). Abundances of the taxa in all taxonomic ranks in each sample were used to construct sample-similarity matrices by the Bray-Curtis algorithm and analyzed the relative similarity of microbiota composition between groups according to non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). As shown in Fig. 7E-F, the results of NMDS and PCoA showed that there were differences in microbial profiles among the four groups, with a relatively large distance between the control and DSS groups as indicated by a more unique microbiota composition, especially in terms of principal component 2 (PCoA2). Based on the results of the above analyses, we continued to investigate the microbial population composition at the phylum level, and most of the samples exhibited high levels of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia at the phylum level. DSS intervention significantly down-regulated the proportion of Bacteroidetes and increased the proportion of proteobacteria in the intestinal flora. However, the increase in the proportion of firmicutes was accompanied by a down-regulation of the proportion of proteobacteria in the AS-IV group (Fig. 7G). At the genus level, we observed ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (secreting butyrate), Escherichia-Shigella (producing the inflammatory factor IL-1β), Alloprevotella (producing short-chain fatty acids), and Akkermansia (the most promising next-generation probiotics) are as the dominant bacteria. Escherichia-Shigella was increased by DSS but recovered after AS-IV treatment. In addition, the content of ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Alloprevotella, and Akkermansia was significantly increased in the AS-IV group (Fig. 7H). It is known that Akkermansia is effective in increasing mucus thickness and strengthening intestinal barrier function. The above results suggested that AS-IV plays a role in regulating the mucosal barrier by interfering with gut microflora homeostasis.","The elimination of intestinal inflammation is a complex biological process, involving multiple stages such as the repair of damaged intestinal mucosa and the regeneration of intestinal epithelial cells, and finally the termination of inflammation and the return of tissue homeostasis. At present, the conventional treatment of UC mainly includes aminosalicylic acid, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants, but these drugs are often accompanied by serious adverse effects and can even be life-threatening. It is worth noting that as one of the main active ingredients of Astragalus, AS-IV can exert biological effects by regulating the activity of proteins, thus inhibiting the overactivation of the immune response in vivo. We demonstrated that the expression of intestinal mucosal epithelial TJs in UC patients and colitic mice was significantly decreased accompanied by an over-activated PI3K/AKT axis. However, AS-IV was able to effectively reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, promote the expression of TJs barrier proteins, and ameliorate the damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier to alleviate murine colitis to a great extent. Meanwhile, 16 S rRNA sequencing showed that AS-IV significantly improved the intestinal flora disorders in colitic mice by increasing the proportion of Firmicutes decreasing the proportion of Proteobacteria, and significantly increasing the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria such as AKK. As the most promising next-generation probiotic, AKK can regulate glucose and lipid metabolism as well as mucus secretion, and limited studies have shown that AKK has the function of monitoring and regulating immune homeostasis and can alleviate inflammation in IEC by down-regulating PI3K/AKT expression. These data collectively suggested that inhibiting the activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is a potential mechanism of AS-IV in UC treatment.As a lipid kinase located near the inner layer of the plasma membrane, PI3K has Ser/Thr and phosphatidylinositol kinase activity. It is composed of a regulatory subunit, p85, and a catalytic subunit, p110, with the catalytic subunit having auto-suppressor properties, leading to near inactivation of the enzyme in the resting state. Upon activation, PI3K will phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). AKT is a subgroup of the Ser/Thr kinase family of AGC proteins that are a central node for cell signaling downstream of growth factors, cytokines, and other cellular stimuli. It can be activated with the help of the PI3K downstream effector phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1).The activating of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway can induce NF-κB, LPS, and TNF-α-mediated pro-inflammatory and apoptotic signals by enhancing the phosphorylation of IκB (mainly IκBα) and reducing the synthesis of IκB, leading to the imbalance of cytokine secretion and enlarging the inflammatory chain reaction. Eventually, inflammation and intestinal mucosal damage persist. American cockroach extracts Ento-A effectively increased the expression levels of IL-4 and forkhead transcription factor protein 3 (Foxp3) while decreasing the expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-17 in splenic lymphocytes, inhibited the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway, and ameliorated UC symptoms. Hany et al. revealed that dapagliflozin exerts ameliorative effects on experimental colitis by inhibiting the HMGB1/RAGE/NF-κB cascade through activation of the AMPK/mTOR and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways, augmenting colon autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis. Our study and the above literature have firmly supported that activated PI3K/AKT1 can lead to damage of intestinal mucosa by increasing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, we have reason to think that the inhibition of PI3KAKT1 might be beneficial for the treatment of UC because it is more critical for the healing of mucosa to decrease the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The latter has been demonstrated to be a main factor directly causing mucosal damage.Intestinal mucosal barriers mainly include mechanical, microbial, immune, and chemical barriers, we mainly studied the mechanical and microbial barriers in this study. Our group previously reported that AS-IV can effectively inhibit pro-inflammatory macrophages and promote alternative macrophage polarization to improve the immune barrier of colitis by regulating the STAT signaling pathway. These two studies provided a more comprehensive theoretical basis for the clinical research and application of AS-IV.However, there are some shortcomings in this study. First of all, the use of Caco-2 cells as an in vitro intestinal barrier model instead of primary intestinal epithelial cells is a limitation. Currently, in vitro culture and processing of primary intestinal epithelial cells is still relatively difficult. Normally, organ cells gather together and adhere tightly to the extracellular matrix, and form a self-executing “home” that depends on the nutrient supply of growth factors for their function and survival. However, disturbance of the extracellular matrix or lacking growth factors usually leads to programmed cell death of IEC, thus greatly limiting the culture of intestinal epithelial primary cells in vitro. Secondly, genetically modified mice with mutant AKT1 which maintains its kinase activity but loses the AS-IV binding sites were not introduced is another limitation of this study. In future studies, we will attempt to be able to isolate and culture primary IECs from mouse intestines, obtain intestinal organoids, and build AKT1 mutant transgenic mice for in-depth exploration.","In summary, we report here that AS-IV reduces inflammation and repairs the mucosal barrier of UC at least partially by blocking the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that PI3K/AKT is a promising candidate target in UC therapy and provides new insights regarding the therapeutic potential of AS-IV for UC treatment, which has important research significance and clinical value.Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material."
10,TA043851,10.1093/hr/uhac158,Involvement of histone deacetylase CsHDA2 in regulating (E)-nerolidol formationin tea (Camellia sinensis) exposed to tea green leafhopper infestation.,"Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) help the tea plant (Camellia sinensis)adapt to environmental stress, and they are also quality-related components oftea. However, the upstream mechanism regulating the herbivore-induced expressionof volatile biosynthesis genes is unclear, especially at the level of epigeneticregulation. In this study, similar to the effects of a tea green leafhopperinfestation, treatments with exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and histone deacetylaseinhibitors significantly increased the (E)-nerolidol content in tea and inducedthe expression of the associated biosynthesis gene CsNES. Furthermore, a keytranscription factor related to JA signaling, myelocytomatosis 2 (CsMYC2),interacted with histone deacetylase 2 (CsHDA2) in vitro and in vivo. A tea greenleafhopper infestation inhibited CsHDA2 expression and decreased CsHDA2abundance. Moreover, the tea green leafhopper infestation increased H3 and H4acetylation levels in the promoter region of CsNES, which in turn upregulated theexpression of CsNES and increased the (E)-nerolidol content. In this study, werevealed the effects of histone acetylations on the accumulation of HIPVs, whilealso confirming that CsHDA2-CsMYC2 is an important transcriptional regulatorymodule for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by tea green leafhoppers.The results of this study may be useful for characterizing plant aromaticcompounds and the main upstream stress-responsive signaling molecules.Furthermore, the study findings will assist researchers clarify the epigeneticregulation influencing plant secondary metabolism in response to external stress.","Gu, Dachuan, Wu, Shuhua, Yu, Zhenming, Zeng, Lanting, Qian, Jiajia, Zhou, Xiaochen, Yang, Ziyin",2022,Horticulture research,2,False,False,True,"Herbivore infestations are an important selection pressure for plants because they lead to the evolution of protective secondary metabolites. In response to insects or their eggs, some plants can synthesize and release volatile metabolites into the air. These complex herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) consist of diverse volatile organic compounds, including alkenes, alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers, esters, and carboxylic acids. These stress-induced volatile metabolites help plants cope with adverse environmental stresses in a variety of ways, and they can also influence crop aroma quality. For example, the aroma of tea (Camellia sinensis), a cash crop widely cultivated in China, is essential to the sensory evaluation and commercial value of tea. Tea plants are under various stresses during the pre-harvest growth period and post-harvest processing, resulting in the induction of accumulation of volatile metabolites, thereby enhancing aroma quality. Specifically, herbivore stress is one of the important aroma-inducing factors. A typical example of using herbivores to enhance the aroma of tea leaves is the noted oolong tea, Oriental Beauty Tea. Oriental Beauty Tea has a unique honey fruit fragrance, and is processed from fresh tea leaves infested by tea green leafhoppers (Empoasca onukii). To date, studies on HIPVs in tea plants have mostly focused on metabolite and transcript levels. For example, several studies on the effects of piercing–sucking insects (e.g. tea green leafhopper) and chewing insects (e.g. tea geometrid) on tea plants revealed that many volatile fatty acid derivatives, volatile phenylpropane/phenyl compounds, and volatile terpenes are produced and released after an infestation. The subsequent transcriptome-level research demonstrated that herbivore infestations activate the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway and some secondary metabolite synthesis pathways in a process that may be primarily regulated by transcription factors or protein kinases. Some stress-induced volatile synthase genes in tea plants have been cloned and analyzed to verify the functions of the encoded enzymes. Examples include the methyl salicylic acid carboxymethyltransferase gene CsSAMT, the JA carboxyl methyltransferase gene CsJMT, the β-ocimene synthase gene CsOS2, the (S)-linalool synthase genes CsLIS1 and CsLIS2, the indole synthetase genes CsTSA and CsTSB2, the (E)-nerolidol synthase gene CsNES, and the α-farnesene synthase gene CsAFS. However, the mechanism underlying the herbivore-induced expression of these genes remains unclear.Both endogenous (developmental) and exogenous environmental factors (biotic and abiotic stresses) induce the production of volatile metabolites in plants. For instance, upregulation of sesquiterpene synthesis genes in Arabidopsis floral organs correlates with flower development. Moreover, wounding and low-temperature stress induced the expression of the indole synthesis gene CsTSB2 in tea leaves, resulting in the accumulation of indole. In addition to endogenous developmental factors and exogenous environmental factors, the plant hormone JA also has an essential role in the production of plant volatile metabolites. When tea leaves were treated with JA, the indole synthesis gene CsTSB2 was significantly induced, and the corresponding volatile metabolite indole accumulated. JA regulates downstream gene expression and metabolite responses, such as accumulation of volatile indole, mainly through the signaling pathway transcription factor MYC2. Moreover, epigenetic regulation has also been reported to be associated with volatile metabolite production in tea. Under continuous wounding stress, H3K9Me2 and DNA methylation levels in the promoter region of CsTSB2 decreased, thereby promoting CsTSB2 expression, resulting in increased indole content. Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms mainly include histone modification, nucleosome remodeling, DNA methylation, non-coding RNA and histone variants, which regulate the temporal and spatial expression of specific genes at the transcriptional level. However, there are still relatively few reports describing the correlation between the accumulation of volatile metabolites in tea and epigenetic regulation. It is also unclear whether histone acetylation is related to the production of volatile metabolites in tea.(E)-Nerolidol is an important compound that influences tea aromas, while also participating in plant resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Regarding its effect on food quality, (E)-nerolidol is a volatile compound with a floral fragrance; it is present in tea at a relatively high concentration, especially in oolong tea. Thus, (E)-nerolidol is considered to be a crucial aromatic component of high-quality oolong tea. Additionally, (E)-nerolidol is an important biologically active compound with pharmacological properties (e.g. antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-ulcer, skin penetration enhancement, antitumor, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties). In plants, (E)-nerolidol and its derivative 4,8-dimethylnonyl-1,3,7-triene play a key role in responses to infestations by phytophagous insects. Recent studies on tea plants revealed that (E)-nerolidol is a signaling substance that prompts defense of tea plants against pathogens and insects and helps mediate responses to cold stress and plant–plant communication induced by cold stress. However, it is unclear how herbivore infestations induce (E)-nerolidol accumulation.In this study, an examination of tea leaves treated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors indicated that HDACs may be related to the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol in tea plants following tea green leafhopper infestation. Correlation analyses and the identification of interacting proteins suggested that CsHDA2 and CsMYC2 may be important for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by tea green leafhoppers. Furthermore, we observed that the production of CsHDA2 and its binding to the CsNES promoter decreased after a tea green leafhopper infestation, and this enhanced the H4 acetylation of the CsNES promoter region. This was followed by the activation of CsNES and an increase in (E)-nerolidol content. The results of this study clarify the effect of histone acetylations on the accumulation of HIPVs and identified CsHDA2–CsMYC2 as an important transcriptional regulatory module for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by a tea green leafhopper infestation.","The tea cultivar used in this study was C. sinensis ‘Jinxuan’ and all the tea samples (one bud and three leaves) were collected from the Yingde tea field, China (23°N, 113°E). All treated tea samples were placed in an incubator (temperature 25°C, relative humidity 80%, light intensity 6500 lux, and 16 hours light/8 hours dark). Every replicate contained 10 tea shoots, and each treatment group had three biological repeats.Tea green leafhoppers (Empoasca onukii Matsuda, fifth instar) were collected from the Yingde tea field, China (23°N, 113°E). The tea branches and tea green leafhoppers were collected in November 2019. Each replicate consisted of 10 tea shoots, which were cultivated in a plastic bottle, the opening of which was sealed with gauze. Then, 10 tea shoots in a bottle were treated with 40 tea green leafhoppers. Subsequently, the bottles were positioned in an incubator for 48 and 96 hours. Tea branches without infestation by tea green leafhoppers incubated in an identical situation were used as the control. Owing to the uncertainty of the infestation of tea green leafhoppers in tea, in order to achieve a better treatment effect, the treatment time for the infestation of tea green leafhoppers was relatively long.Tea branches (plucked in September 2020) were soaked in 2.5 mM JA solution (containing 1% ethanol for solubilization) for 24 hours. Tea branches treated with 1% ethanol–water (v/v) solution and incubated in an identical situation served as the control.Tea branches (plucked in June 2018) were independently soaked in HDAC inhibitor mixed solution [containing 0.25 mM sodium butyrate, 0.25 mM SBHA (suberohydroxamic acid), 0.25 mM TSA and 0.25 mM nicotinamide; dissolved in 5% ethanol] for 24 hours. Tea branches treated with 5% ethanol–water (v/v) solution and incubated in an identical situation served as the control.Dichloromethane was used to extract tea samples and ethyl decanoate was used as an internal standard. After extraction, the samples were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis using a QP2010 SE (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The quantitative analysis of (E)-nerolidol depended on the calibration curve of the standard.Total RNA was extracted with a Quick Plant Total RNA Kit (Huayueyang Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the PrimeScript® RT (TAKARA, Dalian) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instruments (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and SYBR Green Mix fluorescent dye reagent (Bio-Rad, USA) were used for qRT–PCR. The internal reference gene was CsEF1-α (GenBank no. KA280301.1). The 2-ΔΔCt method was used to analyze the relative expression levels of genes.Tea samples with or without tea green leafhopper infestation were harvested for total protein extraction. The sample powder was fully homogenized with vegetable protein extraction buffer (Fude, China), then boiled and separated on Smart PAGE™ precast gels using MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) running buffer (Smart-Lifescience, China). Anti-Actin (Abbkine, USA) and anti-CsHDA2 (Huaan, China) antibodies were used as primary antibodies, and appropriate goat secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (Abbkine, USA) were used for detection. The gray-scale intensity of protein bands in western blots was analyzed by Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, USA).The open reading frame (ORF) of CsHDA2 was cloned into pSAT6–EYFP vector. Mesophyll protoplasts were obtained from Arabidopsis leaves and were enzymatically hydrolyzed in the enzyme solution at room temperature for 5 hours. The constructed vector CsHDA2–YFP (10 μg) was instantaneously transformed into Arabidopsis protoplasts by PEG4000. The protoplasts were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) after incubation at 22°C for 16 hours. The primers for subcellular vector construction are presented in Supplementary Data Table S1.The constructed vector 35S:CsHDA2–GFP was transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101-pSoup. The empty vector 35S:GFP was used as an internal control. A single colony was cultured in LB liquid medium (containing 50 μg/mL rifampicin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin) and shaken at 28°C overnight. Then, the Agrobacterium cells were collected and resuspended in suspension containing 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES, and 150 μM acetosyringone to adjust the OD600 to 1.0–1.2. Then, the resuspension was stood at room temperature for 2 hours. A disposable syringe was used to inject the Agrobacterium liquid into the epidermis of 4-week-old tobacco leaves. After incubation for at least 48 hours, the tobacco leaves were collected and stored at −80°C.The enzymatic determination method of HDAC was as described in a previous study. The purified protein was collected from tobacco leaves that transiently expressed 35S:CsHDA2–GFP or 35S:GFP. Enzyme activity was determined using an HDAC enzyme activity colorimetric assay kit (K331-100, BioVision) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.For studying the transcriptional activation of CsMYC2 to CsNES promoter, the primers were designed with reference to the promoter sequence of CsNES (XM_028232453.1) based on the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The primers for vector construction are presented in Supplementary Data Table S1. The promoter was cloned into the pGreenII 0800–LUC dual reporter vector, and the constructed pHB–CsMYC2–FLAG plasmid was used as an effector. The Agrobacterium strain GV3101-pSoup was used to transiently co-transfer the CsNES-reporter plasmid and CsMYC2-effector plasmid into tobacco leaves. After 2 days of incubation, a dual-luciferase reporter kit (Promega) and microplate reader (Tecan Infinite F50, Tecan Austria) were used to determine the activity of LUC and REN luciferases. The ratio of LUC to REN reflects the final transcription activity.The full-length ORFs of tea genes CsHDA2, CsHDA8, and CsMYC2 were amplified separately and were cloned into pGADT7 or pGBKT7 vectors with MonClone™ Hi-Fusion Cloning Mix (catalog no. RN06004M, Monad). The paired AD and BD construct vectors were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109 by the lithium acetate method, and yeast cells were cultured on Minimal Media Double Dropouts (SD/−Leu/−Trp) at 28°C for 2 days to screen out single colonies of yeast successfully co-transformed. Then, the transformed colonies were transferred onto Minimal Media Quadruple Dropouts (SD/−Leu/−Trp/−Ade/−His) to verify whether CsHDA2/CsHDA8 and CsMYC2 interact. 3-Amino-1, 2, 4-triazole (3-AT) was added to the Minimal Media Quadruple Dropouts to repress background growth. The primers for yeast two-hybrid vector construction are presented in Supplementary Data Table S1.The constructed pEAQ–CsMYC2–GFP and pHB–CsHDA2–FLAG vectors were respectively transferred into Agrobacterium GV3101-pSoup and Agrobacterium co-infected 4-week-old tobacco. After 48 hours of culture, the tobacco leaf materials were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen. Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 2 mM PMSF, 0.05 mM MG132) was used to extract tobacco protein. The protein supernatant obtained was added with anti-GFP magarose beads (Smart-Lifesciences, China) and incubated at 4°C for 2 hours. The beads were washed twice with washing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 2 mM PMSF) and were collected. The immunoprecipitated proteins were tested by western blotting with anti-GFP (Abbkine, USA) and anti-FLAG antibody (TransGen, Beijing, China).The ChIP analysis was investigated using the reported method with little modifications. The tea samples were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde solution under vacuum for 0.5 hours. Using sonication (Scientz, 92-IID), chromatin was dissociated and cut to an average length close to 500 bp, followed by immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, such as anti-acetyl-histone H3 (06-599, Millipore), anti-acetyl-histone H4 (06-866, Millipore), anti-CsHDA2 (Huaan, China), anti-CsMYC2 (Huaan, China), and anti-normal rabbit IgG (12–370, Millipore). The cross-linking was then reversed, and the DNA was extracted and purified with a Zymo Research Kit (D4013). The amount of each immunoprecipitated DNA fragment was determined by quantitative PCR using the gene-specific primers in Supplementary Data Table S1.The ORFs of CsHDA2 were cloned into expression vector pGEX4T-3 and transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3). BL21 (DE3) cells were incubated at 37°C for 1.5–2 hours to OD600 = 0.6. To obtain recombinant GST-tagged protein, IPTG (isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside) was mixed in the cultures, which were incubated at 37°C for another 4 hours. Then, to obtain recombinant GST-tagged protein, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 × PBS buffer (2.7 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10 mM Na2HPO4). The supernatant was collected and tested by western blot analysis with anti-GST (Abbkine, USA) and anti-CsHDA2 (Huaan, China) antibody.The coding sequence of CsMYC2 and CsHDA2 was cloned into the pGEX4T-3 vector to yield the GST–CsMYC2 and GST–CsHDA2 fusion proteins, and the plasmids obtained were transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells to induce fusion proteins. In addition, empty pGEX4T-3 vectors were transformed to obtain GST tags used as control. Proteins (including GST tag, GST–CsMYC2, and GST–CsHDA2) were induced by adding IPTG and purified using glutathione beads (Smart-Lifesciences, China). Probe sequences of CsMYC2 (5′-CTACTTTCATGTGATTCTATGTTCAACTCTCCCAAGCAACATACTTACGAAAATTTTCTTGCCATTTGACAAAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTTTGTCAAATGGCAAGAAAATTTTCGTAAGTATGTTGCTTGGGAGAGTTGAACATAGAATCACATGAAAGTAG-3′) were synthesized and labeled (3′-end) with biotin. EMSA was carried out using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.The Quick Plant Total RNA Kit (Huayueyang Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was used to extract total RNA. Sequencing libraries with 250-bp fragments were constructed using the Illumina Novseq platform with PE150 according to the standard Illumina procedure. Each sample contained three replicates.Data analysis was provided by Bio&Data Biotechnologies Inc. (Guangzhou, China). Briefly, transcriptome raw reads were preprocessed by Fastp v.0.20.1 with default parameters for the purpose of adaptor trimming and removal of low-quality RNA-seq reads (Phred quality scores <20). Clean reads were mapped to a tea reference genome (http://tpdb.shengxin.ren/Blast.html) for further analysis. Gene expression levels were calculated using the fragments per kilobase per million reads (FPKM) method, and DEGs were defined based on the following criteria: a DESeq2-adjusted false discovery rate <0.01 and fold change >2 compared with the control samples. In addition, genes were annotated with eggNOG 5.0. The Benjamini–Hochberg test was performed to detect statistically significant enrichment of the KEGG pathway.Two peptides (amino acids 288–301 and 335–348) for CsMYC2 and two peptides (amino acids 15–28 and 205–218) for CsHDA2 were chemically prepared and used to immunize rabbits to obtain antibodies (Hangzhou HuaAn Biotechnology Company, Hangzhou, China).Student’s t-test was used to test whether there were any differences between the treatments. All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. P ≤ .05 and P ≤ 0.01 were considered as significant and extremely significant, respectively.Accession numbers are as follows: CsHDA2 (XM_028266230.1), CsHDA5 (XM_028270527.1), CsHDA6 (XM_028198649.1), CsHDA8 (XM_028230298.1), CsHDA9 (XM_028254491.1), CsHDA14 (XM_028256101.1), CsHDA15 (XM_028254911.1), CsHDA19–1 (XM_028208382.1), CsHDA19–2 (XM_028226874.1), CsHDT1–1 (XM_028241623.1), CsHDT1–2 (XM_028223731.1), CsSRT1–1 (XM_028252771.1), CsSRT1–2 (XM_028259997.1), CsSRT2 (XM_028196821.1), CsMYC2 (XM_028207058.1), CsEF1-α (KA280301.1), and CsNES (XM_028232453.1).","To explore the effects of a tea green leafhopper infestation on the (E)-nerolidol content, infestation of tea green leafhoppers on tea plants was simulated in an indoor environment (Fig. 1a). At 48 and 96 hours post-infestation, the (E)-nerolidol content was significantly elevated in the infested tea leaves in comparison with the control (Fig. 1b). The subsequent determination of the expression level of the (E)-nerolidol synthase gene, CsNES, indicated that it increased following infestation by tea green leafhoppers (Fig. 1b). The JA pathway is one of the most important signaling pathways for inducing HIPV production in plants. Because MYC2 is an essential transcription factor involved in the JA signaling pathway, we investigated the effect of tea green leafhoppers on MYC2 expression in tea leaves. Infestation by tea green leafhoppers significantly induced CsMYC2 expression (Fig. 1b). Thus, tea green leafhopper infestation promoted the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol and JA as well as the expression of related genes.(E)-Nerolidol is a volatile secondary metabolite produced by tea plants infested with tea green leafhoppers. To explore whether its production is related to the upstream effects of JA, tea leaves were treated with JA for 24 hours and then the changes in the (E)-nerolidol content and in the expression of CsNES were analyzed. Surprisingly, the effects of the JA treatment were similar to those of the tea green leafhopper infestation. The JA treatment significantly increased the (E)-nerolidol content in tea leaves (Fig. 1c) while also activating the expression of CsNES (Fig. 1c). These findings implied that the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by a tea green leafhopper infestation is closely related to the JA signaling pathway.The gene expression associated with biotic stress responses is modulated by epigenetic modifications, especially histone acetylations. To verify whether histone acetylations contribute to the formation of (E)-nerolidol after an infestation by tea green leafhoppers, tea leaves were treated with HDAC inhibitors for 24 hours, after which the (E)-nerolidol content and the expression of (E)-nerolidol synthesis-related genes were analyzed. Consistent with the observed changes induced by the tea green leafhopper infestation, the HDAC inhibitor treatment significantly increased the (E)-nerolidol level in tea plants (Fig. 1c). It also induced the expression of CsNES (Fig. 1c), indicating that HDAC mediates the production of (E)-nerolidol.A recent study identified 14 HDACs in tea plants. To assess whether a tea green leafhopper infestation induces the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol by affecting HDACs, we examined the expression of 14 HDAC genes in response to tea green leafhoppers. At two post-infestation time-points, the expression levels of most of the HDAC genes were downregulated. The exceptions were CsHDA6 and CsSRT1-2, which had upregulated expression levels (Fig. 2a). Because HDACs are usually transcriptional repressors, we speculated that the HDAC genes (e.g. CsHDA2 and CsHDA8) with downregulated expression levels at the two analyzed time-points likely encode regulators of (E)-nerolidol accumulation. These results indicate that infestation by tea green leafhoppers regulates the expression of HDAC genes.A previous study involving Arabidopsis confirmed that JA does not regulate AtHDA8 expression. Thus, we selected CsHDA2 for subsequent analyses. We prepared an anti-CsHDA2 polyclonal antibody solution and validated it with an Escherichia coli expression protein (Supplementary Data Fig. S1), and then used it to detect changes in the CsHDA2 level following an infestation by tea green leafhoppers. The results indicated that the abundance of CsHDA2 decreased after the tea green leafhopper infestation, which was consistent with the CsHDA2 expression data (Fig. 2b).In order to evaluate more comprehensively the impact of tea green leafhopper infestation, we performed RNA-seq analysis on tea leaves after tea green leafhopper infestation for 48 hours. A total of 3034 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened among all the libraries. Compared with the control group, 1353 and 1681 DEGs were downregulated and upregulated after infestation with tea green leafhoppers, respectively (Fig. 3a). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database enrichment analysis of the DEGs showed that plant hormone signal transduction and multiple metabolic pathways were highly enriched (Fig. 3b). The sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway was also included in the KEGG analysis results, which was consistent with the role of (E)-nerolidol as a volatile sesquiterpene (Fig. 3b). Moreover, CsHDA2, CsMYC2, and CsNES were all present in our DEGs, and the expression trends were consistent with previous qRT–PCR results (Fig. 3c).HDACs are usually transcriptional regulators in the nucleus. Accordingly, we examined the subcellular localization of CsHDA2 in vivo. We cloned the tea CsHDA2 gene and fused its coding sequence to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) gene sequence. The resulting fusion construct was transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts, wherein the fluorescence of CsHDA2–YFP was detected only in the nucleus along with the nuclear localization marker mCherry signal (Fig. 4a). This suggested that CsHDA2 may be a nuclear protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator.To further functionally characterize CsHDA2, we expressed CsHDA2–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in tobacco leaves (Fig. 4b). HDAC activity was determined by a colorimetry-based assay. The positive control was HeLa nuclear extract containing the HDAC mixture. Additionally, the specificity of the deacetylase activity was verified by adding the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Unlike the negative control, the CsHDA2–GFP protein had HDAC activities (Fig. 4c), which were significantly inhibited by trichostatin A.HDACs usually form complexes with transcription factors to perform their functions. We previously demonstrated that the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by a tea green leafhopper infestation is related to the JA pathway and HDAC. This compelled us to determine whether CsHDA2 directly interacts with CsMYC2. We first detected the protein interaction between CsHDA2 and CsMYC2 in a yeast two-hybrid experiment. Yeast cells co-transformed with AD-CsHDA2 and BD-CsMYC2 grew on the selective medium QDO, suggesting that CsHDA2 directly interacts with CsMYC2 (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the yeast two-hybrid experiment result also showed that CsHDA8 did not interact with CsMYC2 (Supplementary Data Fig. S2).Furthermore, CsHDA2–GFP and CsMYC2–FLAG were transiently expressed in tobacco leaves for a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis to verify the interaction in vivo. The CsMYC2–FLAG fusion protein was detected after the CsHDA2–GFP immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP antibody-coated magnetic beads (Fig. 4e). Our results indicated that CsHDA2 directly interacted with CsMYC2 both in vivo and in vitro.To evaluate whether CsMYC2 regulates CsNES expression, we performed a dual-luciferase reporter assay to detect transient expression. The dual-luciferase reporter plasmid contained the CsNES promoter fused to the LUC-encoding sequence. The REN-encoding sequence under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter was taken as an internal control, whereas the CsMYC2–FLAG plasmid was used as the effector (Fig. 5a). The expression of CsMYC2 significantly activated the CsNES promoter activity in comparison with the control (Fig. 5b), indicating that CsMYC2 may act as a transcriptional promoter that induces CsNES expression.Because CsMYC2 can promote CsNES expression and directly interact with CsHDA2, we examined whether CsNES is a direct downstream target gene of CsMYC2 and CsHDA2 following a tea green leafhopper infestation. The MYC2 transcription factor usually targets the G-box (CACATG) motif or its variant (E-box) in JA-responsive gene promoters to regulate expression. An analysis of the CsNES promoter revealed the presence of two E-box elements (Fig. 6a). Thus, we investigated the effects of an infestation by tea green leafhoppers on the binding of CsMYC2 to this region as well as to one other promoter region that lacks E-box elements. The specific binding of CsMYC2 to the P2 region (containing E-box elements) increased significantly at 48 hours post-infestation, but there were no further increases at 96 hours (Fig. 6b). We subsequently assessed the effects of a tea green leafhopper infestation on the binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter via a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment. The results indicated that the binding of CsHDA2 to the P2 region of the CsNES promoter decreased significantly at 48 hours post-infestation. In contrast, the binding of CsHDA2 to the P2 regions increased at 96 hours post-infestation (Fig. 6b). These observations implied that an infestation by tea green leafhoppers may modulate CsNES expression by affecting the binding of CsMYC2 and CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter.Then, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to confirm the ability of CsMYC2 to bind to 3′-biotin-labeled probes, which contained two E-box motifs in the CsNES promoter in vitro. The purified GST (glutathione-S-transferase)–CsMYC2 fusion protein bound to the E-box, which contained a fragment of CsNES (Fig. 6c). Since CsHDA2 directly interacted with CsMYC2, we further determined if the interaction affected the binding of CsMYC2 to the CsNES promoter. Therefore, purified GST–MYC2 and GST–CsHDA2 fusion proteins were reacted with biotin-labeled probe containing the E-box motif. The result suggested that CsHDA2 did not bind to the E-box probe. Besides, the binding of CsMYC2 to the E-box probe was not changed when increasing amounts of CsHDA2 or GST were added (Fig. 6c). These findings indicated that CsHDA2 was not directly bound to the E-box region of the CsNES promoter, and would not inhibit the binding of CsMYC2 to the promoter of CsNES.Previous research confirmed that CsHDA2 has HDAC activity. To explore whether the increase in CsNES expression caused by a tea green leafhopper infestation is related to the changes in acetylation caused by altered CsHDA2 binding, we determined the H3 and H4 acetylation levels of the CsNES promoter and the first exon after a tea green leafhopper infestation (Fig. 6d). Unlike the first exon, the H4 acetylation level in the CsNES promoter increased significantly at 48 hours post-infestation (Fig. 6e). At 96 hours post-infestation, the H3 acetylation level in the CsNES promoter region increased significantly, whereas the H4 acetylation level decreased significantly (Fig. 6e). Hence, the CsNES expression induced by the tea green leafhopper infestation was likely related to an increase in the H3 and H4 acetylation levels in the promoter region.Previous data showed that treatments with exogenous JA and HDAC inhibitors both induced the expression of CsNES (Fig. 1c). We then investigated how CsNES was regulated by upstream regulators and histone acetylation modification under exogenous JA and HDAC inhibitor treatments. After JA treatment for 24 hours, similar to tea green leafhopper infestation, the binding of CsMYC2 to the P2 region of the CsNES promoter was increased (Supplementary Data Fig. S3a and b). However, the binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter showed no significant difference after JA treatment for 24 hours (Supplementary Data Fig. S3a and b). After HDAC inhibitor treatment for 24 hours, the H3 and H4 acetylation levels of the CsNES promoter were increased significantly, while only the H4 acetylation level was upregulated significantly in the first exon region of CsNES (Supplementary Data Fig. S3c and d). Collectively, these results indicated that exogenous JA treatment regulated CsNES expression through CsMYC2, and HDAC inhibitor treatment regulated CsNES expression by affecting the H3 and H4 acetylation levels of the CsNES promoter and the first exon regions.","Herbivores are important environmental factors that cause plants to produce secondary metabolites. In this study, we revealed that changes in histone acetylation contribute to HIPV production and that CsHDA2 is a negative regulator. In the absence of tea green leafhoppers, CsHDA2 interacted with CsMYC2 and inhibited downstream CsNES expression through histone deacetylation. After an infestation by tea green leafhoppers, CsHDA2 expression was downregulated. The subsequent decrease in the abundance of the encoded protein resulted in increased CsNES expression and the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol. Our findings confirmed the importance of HDACs for HIPV production.Epigenetic modifications are closely related to the production of intrinsic secondary metabolites in diverse plants. However, most of the related research has focused on DNA methylation, histone methylation, and miRNA, with relatively few reports describing the effects of histone acetylations and specific regulators. The current study revealed that the HDAC CsHDA2 interacts with CsMYC2, a key regulator of the JA signaling pathway (Fig. 4), to co-regulate the accumulation of the secondary metabolite (E)-nerolidol after tea green leafhopper infestation. In previous investigations of Arabidopsis, HDA6 and HDA19 were identified and thoroughly characterized as the HDACs involved in the JA pathway. In contrast, there has been less attention paid to HDA2. However, under 24-hour JA treatment the expression of CsNES was increased (Fig. 1c), while the binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter showed no significant difference (Supplementary Data Fig. S3b). These results indicated that JA-promoted CsNES expression might not depend on CsHDA2, or that CsHDA2 functions at an earlier time-point, which we did not detect. Earlier research suggested that HDA2 may participate in responses to cold stress, but its role in biotic stress responses was not elucidated. The current study indicates that HDA2 homologs in tea plants are involved in the biotic stress response, implying that HDA2 may have diverse functions during stress responses in various species. However, whether CsHDA2 in tea plants is involved in abiotic stress responses should be investigated. Additionally, because tea plants are exposed to multiple burdens during the pre-harvest growth and post-harvest processing stages, they produce substantial amounts of secondary metabolites to cope with environmental stress. There is a close relationship between epigenetic modifications and secondary metabolite production. In addition to HDACs, other potential epigenetic regulators of the accumulation of volatile metabolites induced by a tea green leafhopper infestation remain to be explored. If there are other epigenetic regulators involved, how do they interact with HDACs to co-regulate the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol? What is the specific mechanism underlying the coordinated or antagonistic regulation? Future research conducted to address these questions should focus on multiple networks regulating epigenetic modifications and the integrated regulatory effects of different epigenetic modifications under stress conditions.The JA pathway is an essential signal transduction pathway for inducing HIPVs. Many components of the JA signaling pathway have been identified, including a receptor (COI1), JA signaling suppressors (JAZs), and a transcription factor (MYC2) as well as its related homologs. The COI1–JAZ complex functions as a co-receptor in the JA signal transduction pathway. Specifically, COI1–JAZ interacts with the JA–isoleucine conjugate, which subsequently triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of JAZs. The released MYC2 then forms homodimers or heterodimers with MYC3 or MYC4. These dimers bind to the G-box (CACATG) motif or its variants in JA-responsive gene promoters to regulate expression. Previous studies on Arabidopsis proved that HDACs interact with multiple components of the JA signaling pathway. For example, a Co-IP analysis demonstrated that HDA6 interacts with COI1. Subsequent research indicated that HDA6 also interacts directly with JAZ1, JAZ3, and JAZ9 and inhibits EIN3/EIL1-dependent transcription. In this study, we revealed that CsHDA2 interacts with CsMYC2 to co-regulate CsNES expression (Figs 4–6), indicating that CsHDA2–CsMYC2 is an important transcriptional regulator that controls HIPV production. Collectively, these studies suggest that, in multiple species, HDACs regulate downstream gene expression by interacting with JA signaling pathway components.The HDACs usually form a complex with transcription factors and then inhibit transcription by regulating the acetylation level of downstream genes. However, a recent study proved that HDA9 in Arabidopsis deacetylates the transcription factor WRKY53 to regulate its transcriptional activity and modulate downstream gene expression. Therefore, future studies should explore whether CsHDACs have diverse regulatory effects on the accumulation of HIPVs in tea. Besides, the acetylation status of histones is firmly connected to gene expression. The acetylation of histones is related to histone acetyltransferase, while the deacetylation of histones is associated with HDAC. These enzymes have important roles affecting plant growth and development as well as responses to environmental stress. In Arabidopsis, MYC2 regulates the JA response through the formation of a complex with MED25 and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. In the current study, the extent of the histone acetylation in the CsNES promoter region increased following an infestation by tea green leafhoppers (Fig. 6e). Although CsHDA2 helps regulate this process, whether histone acetyltransferases are also involved should be investigated. In addition, the binding results showed that the binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter decreased after 48 hours and increased after 96 hours of infestation with tea green leafhoppers (Fig. 6b), and this, combined with determinations of gene expression and (E)-nerolidol content (Fig. 1b), suggests that there may be a braking mechanism to prevent the overexpression of CsNES and the excessive accumulation of (E)-nerolidol by regulating the binding of CsHDA2. Due to the importance of (E)-nerolidol in response to herbivore infestation and the decrease in H4 acetylation level in the late stage of tea green leafhopper infestation, the elevation of H3 acetylation level was essential to maintain the expression of CsNES. The changes in binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter showed a good correspondence with the changes in H4 acetylation level, but were not consistent with the changes in H3 acetylation level (Fig. 6). These results revealed that the acetylation level may be regulated by other regulators, most likely those CsHDACs whose expression was downregulated at 96 hours (Fig. 2), indicating that different CsHDACs may be involved in the regulation of early and late responses of the same downstream gene. Arabidopsis contains 18 HDACs that are divided into three families, the largest of which is the RPD3-like superfamily; HDA6, HDA19, HDA2, and HDA8 belong to this superfamily. In Arabidopsis, JA induces the expression of HDA6 and HDA19 [24]. In rice, JA increases the expression of HDA705, which is highly homologous to HDA6 and HDA19. Additionally, HDA6 is reportedly involved in the regulation of the JA response. In our study, CsHDA6 and CsHDA19-2 expression levels increased significantly in tea plants infested with tea green leafhoppers (when the JA content increased significantly) (Fig. 2a). This is consistent with the results of related studies on other species. These findings imply that HDA6 and HDA19 expression induced by JA is common among plant species. Furthermore, JA-induced HDA6 and HDA19 functions may be conserved in multiple species, but they will need to be further explored. Interestingly, there are two HDA19 homologs in tea. We observed that CsHDA19-1 expression was downregulated by an increase in JA levels, whereas CsHDA19-2 had the opposite expression trend (Fig. 2a). This differential expression of CsHDA19-1 and CsHDA19-2 may reflect the differences in the functions of the encoded proteins in response to JA. This possibility will need to be experimentally verified. A previous study regarding Arabidopsis indicated that JA does not regulate HDA8 expression. However, we observed that CsHDA8 expression was downregulated when the JA content increased (Fig. 2a), indicating that JA-induced HDA8 functions may vary among species. Therefore, the functional characterization of the homologous genes in different species is warranted. Furthermore, although HDA6, HDA19, HDA2, and HDA8 are members of the RPD3-like superfamily, they respond differently to herbivore stress. Both HDA6 and HDA19 belong to Class I, HDA2 belongs to Class III, and HDA8 is unclassified. Future studies will need to further clarify how the same upstream stress signal regulates the responses of different downstream factors as well as the interactions among different factors in the same stress response.This study explored the mechanism underlying the effect of the HDAC CsHDA2 on the production of (E)-nerolidol, which is a volatile compound in tea, following an infestation by tea green leafhoppers (Fig. 7). An infestation by tea green leafhoppers inhibits CsHDA2 expression. The subsequent decreased binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter leads to an increase in H4 acetylation levels in the promoter region, which in turn enhances the expression of CsNES and the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol. The results of this study may be useful for clarifying the regulation of tea aromatic compound biosynthesis, and they also provide important information regarding the development of plant aromas and the associated main upstream signaling substances responsive to stress. The data presented herein may form the basis of future research on the epigenetic regulation of external stress-induced plant secondary metabolism.",
11,TA037576,10.2147/IJN.S29945,Antitumor activity of celastrol nanoparticles in a xenograft retinoblastoma tumormodel.,"BACKGROUND: Celastrol, a Chinese herbal medicine, has shown antitumor activityagainst various tumor cell lines. However, the effect of celastrol onretinoblastoma has not yet been analyzed. Additionally, the poor water solubilityof celastrol restricts further therapeutic applications. The goal of this studywas to evaluate the effect of celastrol nanoparticles (CNPs) on retinoblastomaand to investigate the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS: Celastrol-loadedpoly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ɛ-caprolactone) nanopolymeric micelles weredeveloped to improve the hydrophilicity of celastrol. The 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulf-ophenyl)-2H tetrazolium monosodiumsalt (WST-8) assay was used to determine the inhibitory effect of CNPs on SO-Rb50 cell proliferation in vitro. Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate theapoptotic effect of CNPs on nuclear morphology, and flow cytometry was used toquantify cellular apoptosis. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, NF-κB p65, andphospo-NF-κB p65 proteins was assessed by Western blotting. A humanretinoblastoma xenograft model was used to evaluate the inhibitory effects ofCNPs on retinoblastoma in NOD-SCID mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was usedto assess the apoptotic effects of CNPs on retinoblastoma. RESULTS: CNPs inhibitthe proliferation of SO-Rb 50 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with anIC(50) of 17.733 μg/mL (celastrol-loading content: 7.36%) after exposure to CNPsfor 48 hours. CNPs induce apoptosis in SO-Rb 50 cells in a dose-dependent manner.The expression of Bcl-2, NF-κB p65, and phospo-NF-κB p65 proteins decreased afterexposure to CNPs 54.4 μg/mL for 48 hours. Additionally, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratioincreased, whereas the expression of Bax itself was not significantly altered.CNPs inhibit the growth of retinoblastoma and induce apoptosis in retinoblastomacells in mice. CONCLUSION: CNPs inhibit the growth of retinoblastoma in mousexenograft model by inducing apoptosis in SO-Rb 50 cells, which may be related tothe increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the inhibition of NF-κB. CNPs may represent apotential alternative treatment for retinoblastoma.","Li, Zhanrong, Wu, Xianghua, Li, Jingguo, Yao, Lin, Sun, Limei, Shi, Yingying, Zhang, Wenxin, Lin, Jianxian, Liang, Dan, Li, Yongping",2012,International journal of nanomedicine,2,False,False,True,"Retinoblastoma is the most common childhood primary intraocular malignant tumor, with an incidence ranging from 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 18,000 live births. This represents approximately 4% of all pediatric malignancies, and approximately 5000 new cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed around the world each year. Approximately 50% of children diagnosed with retinoblastoma survive their malignancy worldwide. Enucleation is the standard therapy for patients with advanced intraocular disease and is successful in treating intraocular retinoblastoma. Although enucleation can cure unilateral disease in approximately 95% of patients, it may result in vision loss and an unsatisfactory cosmetic appearance. Currently, drugs that induce apoptosis remain the main chemotherapeutic agents in medical oncology, and finding potential therapeutic drugs has been a major goal of retinoblastoma investigations.Traditional Chinese herbal medicines provide a highly fertile ground for modern drug development. Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F, also known as the Thunder of God Vine, belongs to the Celastraceae family and has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Celastrol, a tripterine, is extracted from Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F and shows potential for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that celastrol can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Further study showed that celastrol was a natural inhibitor of proteasome and NF-κB activity. The proteasome is responsible for degrading misfolded intracellular proteins and important cellular modulators, including the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Activation of the NF-κB transcription factor has been connected with multiple aspects of oncogenesis, including the regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. Inhibition of proteasome and/or NF-κB activity leads to cell death and is currently considered an attractive target for the treatment of cancer.Although celastrol, as a natural inhibitor of the proteasome and NF-κB activity, can induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines, including U937 cells, human prostate cancer cell lines, HL-60 cells, and human melanoma cells, the effects of celastrol on retinoblastoma are still not clear. Furthermore, the poor water solubility of celastrol limits its in vivo application. In a previous study, we found that poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly (ɛ-caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL) micelles had promising potential to improve the hydrophilicity of celastrol and extend its release. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of celastrol-loaded PEG-b-PCL nanopolymeric micelles on human retinoblastoma and explored the underlying mechanism of these effects.","Chinese herbal celastrol (Figure 1A) was purchased from the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. The preparation of celastrol-loaded polymer micelles was performed as previously described. Briefly, celastrol-loaded PEG-b-PCL micelles were prepared by dissolving PEG-b-PCL (2000:1000, Mw/Mn = 1.18, JCS Biopolytech, Toronto, Canada; Figure 1B) (10 mg) and celastrol (2 mg) in chloroform (2 mL), and adding the solution drop-wise to ddH2O (20 mL) under ultrasonic agitation using a Type 60 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The organic solvent was then removed by vacuum distillation using a rotary evaporator to allow micelle formation. The samples were further concentrated and washed three times using a Millipore Centrifugal Filter Device (MW cutoff: 10,000 Da; Millipore, Billerica, MA) to remove free celastrol dissolved in the micelle solution, and then filtered with a syringe filter (pore size: 0.22 μm) to eliminate large polymer or celastrol aggregates.The celastrol-release study from polymer micelles in vitro was performed as previously described. Briefly, freeze-dried micelle samples (12 mg each) were resuspended in 3 mL of phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.4) or sodium acetate buffered solution (pH 5.0) and then transferred into a dialysis bag (MW cutoff: 14,000 Da). The bag was placed into the same buffered solution (50 mL). The release study was performed at 37°C in a New Brunswick Scientific C24 incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ). At selected time intervals, buffered solution outside the dialysis bag was removed for reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography columns (UltiMate 3000 HPLC System, Thermo Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA; 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) analysis and replaced with fresh buffer saline. Celastrol concentration was calculated based on the absorbance intensity at 425 nm. The cumulative amount of drug released was calculated, and the percentages of drug released from micelles were plotted against time.SO-Rb 50 cells, derived from a patient with human retinoblastoma, have been constantly preserved in our laboratory and were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.The inhibitory effects of celastrol nanoparticles (CNPs) on SO-Rb 50 cell proliferation were measured using the 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4- disulf-ophenyl)-2H tetrazolium monosodium salt (WST-8) reagent (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. SO-Rb 50 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 103 per well in triplicate in fresh medium for 24 hours. The CNPs were then diluted to appropriate concentrations and immediately applied to the cells. Dose-dependent inhibition was assessed by exposing cells to various concentrations of CNPs (0–54.4 μg/mL) and the same dosage of PEG-b-PCL micelles without celastrol, and culturing cells for an additional 48 hours. A time-dependent inhibition was performed by exposing cells to CNPs at a concentration of 27.2 μg/mL and or the same dose of blank micelles for 24, 48, and 72 hours. WST solution (10 μL) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. Cell viability was measured at 450 nm. Variations in cell morphology were captured after treatment with CNPs for 48 hours. For comparison, the antiproliferation effect of free celastrol on SO-Rb 50 cells was also evaluated for celastrol dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (0.2%, v/v), concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μg/mL for 48 hours and at a concentration of 2 μg/mL for 24, 48, and 72 hours. The measurement protocol was followed according to the description above.SO-Rb 50 cells were allowed to grow on coverslips in a six-well culture plate (Corning, NY) for 24 hours. Next, the cells were treated with 54.4 μg/mL CNPs or blank micelles for 24 hours at 37°C. Cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then stained with Hoechst 33342 for 10 minutes. Nuclear morphology was observed under a fluorescence microscope. Apoptotic cells were identified by changes in nuclear morphology, such as chromatin condensation and fragmentation.Samples were labeled with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and propidium iodide (PI) double staining according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, after treatment with CNPs, cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Next, the cells were resuspended in 200 μL of binding buffer (10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid/NaOH pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2) and 10 μL of annexin V-FITC for 15 minutes in the dark. Then, 300 μL of binding buffer and 5 μL of PI were added to the samples for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the samples were analyzed using flow cytometry.SO-Rb 50 cells were treated with 54.4 μg/mL CNPs or the same dose of blank micelles for 48 hours prior to determining Bcl-2, Bax, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 protein expression. The cells were collected, lysed, and the total protein concentration was quantified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An equal amount of each protein sample was loaded on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 2 hours and incubated with anti- Bcl-2, anti-Bax, anti-NF-κB p65, anti-phospho-NF-κB p65, and anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4°C. Then, the membranes were washed and exposed to goat-anti-rabbit-IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by imaging with a chemiluminescent substrate. The signal was assayed using the ChemiDoc XRs+(Bio-RAD, Hercules, CA) with enhanced chemiluminescence and analyzed using Image Lab (ECL). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as the loading control.All animals in this study were used according to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement in a protocol approved by the Zhongshan Ophthalmology Center in Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Retinoblastoma mouse models were performed as previously described. Briefly, SO-Rb 50 tumor xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection of 5 × 107 cells into the right flanks of 5- to 6-week-old female NOD-SCID mice. When tumors reached a mean tumor volume of 100–200 mm3, as determined by the formula: volume = length × width2 × 0.5, the animals were randomly divided into two groups (five mice per group). The CNP group received intraperitoneal injections of CNPs (27.2 mg/kg/2 days); the control group was given the same dose of blank micelles by intraperitoneal injection. Tumor size was measured using vernier calipers every 4 days. In the tumor survival study, mice were euthanized according to our animal protocol, which instructed that the mice be euthanized within 1 week of the tumor size reaching > 1000 mm3.Tumor tissue was isolated, fixed in 10% formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, 4-μm-thick sections of tumor tissue were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin solution. Tissue morphology was assessed by light microscopy.All experiments were repeated three times. Quantitative variables are presented as the mean ± standard deviation and analyzed using the SPSS (v16.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). An independent sample t-test was performed to determine the significance of differences between the control and CNP-treated groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.","The data for celastrol-loading content, measurements of dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy analysis of CNP diameters have been collected in our previous study. Our results showed that the celastrol-loading content is 7.36% and the mean diameter of CNPs with spherical shapes 48 nm.The in vitro release behaviors of celastrol-loaded micelles in two different buffered solutions (pH 7.4 and 5.0) were studied (Figure 1C). In both solutions, a typical release profile featuring two phases was observed. That is, a relatively rapid release occurred in the first stage, followed by sustained and slow release over a prolonged time up to several weeks. In comparison with the release at pH 7.4, celastrol release from micelles at pH 5.0 is much faster.The inhibitory effect of CNPs on SO-Rb 50 cells was assessed using the WST-8 assay, and the results are shown in Figure 2. SO-Rb 50 cells exposed to CNPs for 48 hours at concentrations ranging from 3.4–54.4 μg/mL showed decreased cell viability as a function of concentration. Cell viability was approximately 30% relative to the control cells at a concentration of 27.2 μg/mL CNPs. Changes in the morphology of cells revealed that increasing the amount of CNPs decreased the number and size of SO-RB 50 cells (Figure 2A). Cell viability was determined after treatment with either blank micelles or CNPs at different concentrations (Figure 2B). CNPs had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation with an IC50 value of 17.733 μg/mL after exposure to CNPs for 48 hours. The IC50 of free celastrol on SO-Rb 50 cells was 0.843 μg/mL. Figure 2C demonstrates a time-dependent decrease in the cell viability of SO-Rb 50 cells. CNP-treated cells (27.2 μg/mL) had a viability of 31.94% compared to controls following exposure for 48 hours. Free celastrol revealed an enhanced inhibitory effect on SO-Rb 50 cells at different time points (Figure 2C). Therefore, it can be concluded that the CNPs inhibited proliferation of human SO-Rb 50 cell growth in both a dose- and time-dependent manner.To investigate the effect of CNPs on apoptosis, we stained SO-Rb 50 cells with Hoechst 33342 after 24 hours of exposure to 54.4 μg/mL CNPs, and subsequently, examined changes in cell morphology using a fluorescence microscope. Figure 3 depicts the significant morphological changes in nuclear chromatin after treatment with CNPs for 24 hours. Untreated cells contain round nuclei with homogeneous chromatin (Figure 3A), whereas the nuclei of cells treated with CNPs display classic morphological characteristic of apoptosis, including a reduction in nuclear size, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation (Figure 3B).To quantify cellular apoptosis, the SO-Rb 50 cells were treated with CNPs at concentrations of 0, 27.2, 54.4, and 108.8 μg/mL for 24 hours. The cells were subsequently co-stained with annexin V-FITC/PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. Representative dot plots of annexin V-FITC/PI staining of SO-Rb 50 cells are shown in Figure 4A, and the percentage of apoptotic cells relative to CNP concentration are shown in Figure 4B. Only a small number of apoptotic cells were detected in 0 and 27.2 μg/mL CNP-treated groups. However, a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells could be detected in the 54.4 and 108.8 μg/mL CNP-treated groups. The number of SO-Rb 50 cells undergoing early- and late-stage apoptosis were 6.7% and 24.4%, respectively, following incubation with 54.4 μg/mL CNPs for 24 hours. The corresponding numbers in the 108.8 μg/mL CNP treatment group were 6.3% and 48.4%, respectively. This demonstrates that CNPs induced apoptosis, especially late-stage apoptosis, in a dose-dependent manner.We determined the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 to understand the effect of CNPs on apoptosis-related proteins in SO-Rb 50 cells. After 48 hours of exposure to 54.4 μg/mL CNPs, the levels of Bcl-2, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 decreased significantly (Figure 5A). Although the expression of Bax showed little change, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 increased significantly (Figure 5B).Following the investigation of apoptosis induction in SO-Rb 50 cells in vitro, the antitumor effect of celastrol nanoparticles was evaluated in vivo. We established a retinoblastoma xenograft model by injecting SO-Rb 50 cells into NOD/SCID mice. Administration of 27.2 mg/kg CNPs every other day for 16 days substantially suppressed tumor volume (Figure 6A) and reduced tumor weight (Figure 6C). The average tumor volume in the control mice increased from 107.08 ± 8.60 mm3 to 1091.41 ± 75.74 mm3 after 16 days, whereas the average tumor volume in the CNP-treated mice decreased from 112.36 ± 7.52 mm3 to 76.11 ± 6.14 mm3 (Figure 6A). Additionally, the average tumor weight in the control group was 623.20 ± 108.85 mg, whereas the average tumor weight in the CNP-treated group was only 58.80 ± 18.13 mg (Figure 6C), indicating a significant inhibition of tumor growth. However, the same dose of CNPs had no significant effect on the body weight of mice compared to the control group (Figure 6B).In control tumor tissue sections, the retinoblastoma cell nuclei were large with prominent nucleoli, and only a few cells showed a reduction in nuclear size with deeply stained nuclei and condensed cytoplasm (Figure 7A). In contrast, a greater number of cells had hyperchromatic nuclei and a reduction in nuclear size in the CNP-treated group (Figure 7B).","In this study, we demonstrate that CNPs can suppress the growth of human retinoblastoma in a xenograft mouse model. One of the major mechanisms through which CNPs mediate their effects against retinoblastoma is by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells.Celastrol can inhibit the proliferation of multiple tumor cell lines in vivo and in vitro through the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells and the suppression of tumor angiogenesis. However, the effect of celastrol on retinoblastoma has not previously been addressed. Additionally, the poor water solubility of celastrol is an obstacle to further therapeutic applications. PEG-b-PCL polymeric micelles have been widely investigated in medical research due to their ability to increase hydrophilicity and extend the release of a drug. Drug-loaded polymeric micelles target tumor tissues through enhanced permeation and retention of the vasculature surrounding tumors. Therefore, nanopolymeric micelles have been considered as an important and attractive class of drug carriers. Previously, it has been reported that PEG-b-PCL micelles loaded with anticancer drugs could significantly improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, we chose PEG-b-PCL as the celastrol delivery carrier to further study the effects of CNPs on retinoblastoma in a xenograft mouse model. In a previous study, we demonstrated that PEG-b-PCL could significantly improve the water solubility of celastrol. We found a typical two-phase-release profile of celastrol release from micelles. Additionally, faster release of celastrol in acidic conditions was also observed, consistent with previous reports. This pH-dependent releasing behavior is of particular interest in achieving the tumor-targeted celastrol delivery with micelles. Micellar particles are generally internalized inside the cells by endocytosis; therefore, faster release inside the lysosome of tumor cells (at approximately pH 5.0) may occur due to the decreased pH values.Celastrol is a component of several herbal medicines that have been known to have antitumor activity. Celastrol itself has antiproliferative activity on different tumor cell lines. In the present study, an in vitro WST assay demonstrated that CNPs inhibit the proliferation of SO-Rb 50 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 17.733 μg/mL (celastrol-loading content: 7.36%, concentration of celastrol: 1.305 μg/mL). Free celastrol had an IC50 value of 0.843 μg/mL and also showed an enhanced inhibitory effect on SO-Rb 50 cells at different time points. The lower potency of micelle-delivered celastrol may be due to a delayed celastrol release from micelles, which is consistent with our study of in vitro celastrol release study.To further analyze CNP-induced cytotoxicity, we investigated the apoptotic effects of CNPs on SO-Rb 50 cells. Apoptosis is an important method of maintaining the balance between cell division and cell death, and the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is an important focus of antitumor drug discovery. This study demonstrates that morphological changes occur in the nucleus of SO-Rb 50 cells following treatment with CNPs for 24 hours. Flow analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in CNP-treated SO-Rb 50 cells. In vivo, CNPs significantly inhibited the growth of retinoblastoma in a xenograft tumor model in NOD-SCID mice. Additionally, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that CNPs induced apoptosis in the retinoblastoma cells.Bcl-2 family members include both anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, and pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax. These proteins are essential in regulating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Overexpression of Bax enhances cell apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2 inhibits this process. A change in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio could lead to cell death. In the current study, CNPs downregulated the expression of Bcl-2, and thereby increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in SO-Rb 50 cells. This suggests that CNPs could change the expression of apoptotic proteins and may trigger apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway in SO-Rb 50 cells.NF-κB is a transcription factor that is strongly related to the inhibition of apoptosis, in addition to contributing to tumor growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Overexpression of NF-κB factors has been shown to block apoptosis. In human retinoblastoma cells, the transcriptional activity of NF-κB is necessary for survival. A recent study suggested that the expression of p65 and c-Rel proteins, NF-κB transcription factor family members, represented a reliable marker for human retinoblastoma. Celastrol has previously been considered a natural NF-κB inhibitor. In this study, SO-Rb 50 cells expressed higher levels of NF-κB p65 and phospho-NF-κB p65, consistent with previous studies. In contrast, the expression of NF-kB p65 and phospho-NF-κB p65 was decreased in the CNP-treated group. Celastrol displayed potent suppression of NF-κB p65 activity in human retinoblastoma cells. This may be one of the mechanisms through which CNPs induce apoptosis in SO-Rb 50 cells.","In this study, we demonstrate that CNPs significantly inhibit the proliferation of human retinoblastoma SO-Rb 50 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CNPs inhibit retinoblastoma growth in a xenograft mouse model by inducing apoptosis in SO-Rb 50 cells, which may be related to an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and inhibition of NF-κB. CNPs may represent a potential alternative treatment for retinoblastoma."
12,TA019095,10.3390/molecules25122840,Costunolide Plays an Anti-Neuroinflammation Role in Lipopolysaccharide-InducedBV2 Microglial Activation by Targeting Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2.,"Hyperactivation of microglia in the brain is closely related to neuroinflammationand leads to neuronal dysfunction. Costunolide (CTL) is a natural sesquiterpenelactone with wide pharmacological activities including anti-inflammation andantioxidation. In this study, we found that CTL significantly inhibited theproduction of inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide, IL-6, TNF-α, andPGE2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia. Moreover, CTLeffectively attenuated IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway activation. To identifydirect cellular target of CTL, we performed high-throughput reverse virtualscreening assay using scPDB protein structure library, and found cyclin-dependentkinase 2 (CDK2) was the most specific binding protein for CTL. We furtherconfirmed the binding ability of CTL with CDK2 using cellular thermal shift assay(CETSA) and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assays. Surfaceplasmon resonance analysis also supported that CTL specifically bound to CDK2with a dissociation constant at micromole level. Furthermore, knocking down CDK2obviously reversed the anti-inflammation effect of CTL via AKT/IKKβ/NF-κBsignaling pathway on BV-2 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that CTLinhibits microglia-mediated neuroinflammation through directly targeting CDK2,and provide insights into the role of CDK2 as a promising anti-neuroinflammationtherapeutic target.","Liu, Yan-Chen, Feng, Na, Li, Wei-Wei, Tu, Peng-Fei, Chen, Jian-Ping, Han, Jing-Yan, Zeng, Ke-Wu",2020,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,True,False,True,"['**1. introduction** Neuroinflammation is a crucial pathological process of various neurodegenerative diseases [\\[1\\]](#page-9-0).

We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out.

They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['**3. discussion** **3. Discussion**  Accumulating evidences suggest that a crucial risk factor of neurodegenerative disorders is highly associated with neuroinflammation [\\[23\\]](#page-10-16). Microglial over-activation leads proinflammatory cytokines secretion, further triggering synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, contributing to neuroinflammation-related pathological changes [\\[24](#page-10-17)[,25\\]](#page-10-18). LPS stimulation can cause a profound attenuated LPS-induced NF-κB pathway activation. immune response in the brain, which leads to the activation of microglia including BV2 [\\[26\\]](#page-10-19). A review reported that when CTL concentration is 0.8–2 µM, it has neuroprotective effect; when the concentration is in the range of 0.1–12.5 µM, CTL has anti-inflammatory activity; it can inhibit cell proliferation and mediate apoptosis when the concentration is around 10–100 µM [\\[27\\]](#page-11-0). In this work, we investigated anti-neuroinflammation role of natural sesquiterpene lactone CTL in LPS-induced BV2 microglia, and further explored its molecular mechanism. We confirmed CTL inhibited LPS-induced neuroinflammation response in BV2 microglia. CTL significantly inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide, TNF-α, IL-6, and PGE2. Moreover, CTL down-regulated expressions of iNOS and COX2. Furthermore, CTL effectively inhibited AKT kinase phosphorylation, prevented phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit, and Cellular target identification is a crucial prerequisite for clarifying biological mechanism of candidate drug. Reverse virtual screening which is based on ""lock-key principle"" of molecular docking is an effective method for cellular target identification [\\[28\\]](#page-11-1). The interaction between ligand and target protein is a process of molecular recognition, including electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and van der Waals interaction. Through reverse virtual screening, the binding mode and affinity of ligand–target protein can be predicted. This method has been successfully used for cellular target identification and pharmacological mechanism researches of natural active molecules [\\[29\\]](#page-11-2). For example, reverse virtual docking was used to predict the targets of apple polyphenols in preventing colorectal cancer, and the main targets were guanosine 5<sup>0</sup> -monophosphate oxidoreductase (GMP reductase), guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) [\\[30\\]](#page-11-3). Reverse virtual docking was also reported to predict the targets of an aminopyridine derivative as cyclin dependent kinases, Bcr-Abl kinase and KIT receptor kinase [\\[31\\]](#page-11-4). In this work, reverse virtual screening was performed to explore the cellular target of CTL. We identified that CDK2 was the target of CTL by screening scPDB protein structure library. CDK2 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in DNA damage responds and cell cycle control [\\[32–](#page-11-5)[34\\]](#page-11-6). Therefore, CDK2 is a promising target for neurodegenerative disorders, cerebral hypoxia, and cancers. Great progress has been made in the study of CDK2 in cell apoptosis, but its research in neuroinflammation needs to be further explored. Our molecular docking diagram and surface potential diagram showed that CTL bound to a cavity of CDK2 and formed hydrophobic interaction with alanine, valine, phenylalanine, and leucine residues around the cavity. Furthermore, the superposition analysis of CDK2-ATP and CDK2-CTL revealed that CTL occupied ATP binding site of CDK2. Therefore, we concluded that CTL affected CDK2 function by competitively binding with ATP to the active site of CDK2. On the other hand, SPR analysis suggested that CTL specifically bound to CDK2 with a dissociation constant at micromole level. Moreover, CETSA [\\[35\\]](#page-11-7) and DARTS [\\[36\\]](#page-11-8) are the important methods to verify the binding of small molecules to their target proteins. Our CETSA and DARTS analysis also confirmed that CTL could increase the resistance of CDK2 to high temperature and enzymes. Therefore, CDK2 was identified to be a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting neuroinflammation. After cellular target identification, we tried to further elucidate potential anti-inflammatory mechanism. AKT kinase plays a key role in controlling neurogenesis including neuron location, dendritic development and synapse upstream formation [\\[37](#page-11-9)[,38\\]](#page-11-10). NF-κB pathway is a canonical pathway in LPS-induced inflammatory response [\\[18\\]](#page-10-11). As a key upstream regulator of IKKβ/NF-κB pathway, AKT also plays an important role in regulating NF-κB-dependent inflammatory gene transcription [\\[21](#page-10-14)[,22\\]](#page-10-15). Therefore, we tried to explore the relationship between CDK2, AKT, and NF-κB pathway in neuroinflammation. In this study, we identified an inhibitory role of CTL in regulation of LPS-activated AKT, IKKβ, IκB-α, and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that CTL significantly inhibited the activation of NF-κB-associated inflammatory gene transcription, indicating that CTL targets on CDK2 to affect AKT phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting NF-κB pathway activation to exert anti-neuroinflammation activity. Notably, we found that CDK2 knockdown significantly reduced the inhibitory ability of CTL on inflammatory mediators production. Moreover, CTL-dependent down-regulation on the phosphorylation of AKT, IKKβ, IκB-α, and NF-κB p65 was significantly reversed when CDK2 was silenced. This observation indicates that CDK2-mediated AKT/IKKβ/NF-κB pathway is highly involved in anti-neuroinflammation effect of CTL. Meanwhile, CDK2 may act as a vital cellular target responsible for anti-neuroinflammation therapy. ']","['**5. conclusions** In summary, our work demonstrated the anti-neuroinflammation capability of CTL in LPS-induced BV2 microglia, and elaborated pharmacological mechanism by cellular target identification technique. These findings suggest CDK2 as a novel therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory diseases, and CTL may serve as crucial candidate compound for neuroinflammation-related diseases. **Author Contributions:** K.-W.Z. and J.-Y.H. conceived and designed this research.

Behavioral responses of H. depressus to airbornevolatile extracts from conspecifics suggested the presence of a male-producedaggregation pheromone. GC analyses of these extracts showed the presence of fourmale-specific compounds. Analytical data in combination with the synthesis ofstandards led to the identification of the male-released semiochemicals asepoxyisophorone (1), isophorone (2), homalinol (3), and 2-hydroxyisophorone (4),of which (3) was the major constituent. The configuration of homalinol wasdetermined to be cis on the basis of retention times of synthetic cis and transsynthetic standards. Enantiomers of cis-homalinol were obtained in highenantiomeric excess by using biocatalysis. Their separation on a GCenantioselective column (β-Dex325®), allowed us to unambiguously determine thatthe absolute configuration of natural homalinol was (1R,2R,6S). Field bioassaysdemonstrated that both the synthetic major compound per se and mixtures of allfour male-specific compounds were attractive to H. depressus.","Vidal, Diogo Montes, Moreira, Marcos Antonio Barbosa, Coracini, Miryan Denise Araujo, Zarbin, Paulo Henrique Gorgatti",2019,Scientific reports,2,False,False,True,"Volatile organic compounds present in nature are produced and released by plants, animals, and microorganisms. Some of these compounds are produced as hormones, semiochemicals (including pheromones), as well as plant defense compounds. Other metabolites are merely biosynthetic byproducts. Communication among insect involves various modalities, including visual, vibrational, tactile, and chemical communication. Aggregation pheromones are sex specific pheromones which attracts both sexes of the species. They have been identified in species from different insect Orders, e.g. Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Dictyoptera, and Orthoptera. Various insect species in the family Curculionidae (Coleoptera), are serious agriculture pests thus prompting a great deal of research aimed at finding new methods of control or attractants for trapping systems. Most of the aggregation pheromones identified in this group are from species in the genus Rhynchophorus, e.g. rhynchophorol (6-methyl-2-(E)-hepten-4-ol) isolated from R. palmarum. A complex aggregation pheromone system, (1R,2S)-grandisol and (1R,2S)-grandisyl acetate, was identified from the first species of Homalinotus genus studied, Homalinotus validus. The chemical structures of the compounds described as aggregation pheromones of Curculionidae to date can be divided into two different classes. The first is related to mostly cyclic monoterpenoids, such as, grandisol, which was originally identified from Anthonomus grandis. The second class is represented by short, and methyl branched alcohols, ketones, and esters, as for example 3-hydroxy-4-methyl-5-nonanone, identified as a component of Metamasius hemipterus pheromone.Coconut (Cocos nucifera, Arecaceae) is one of the main Brazilian fruit crops, with social and economic importance due to the diverse range of products obtained e.g. coconut water, coconut milk, wood, fibers, biofuel, animal food, and oils, among others derivatives useful to the agro-industry. Pest insects cause significant losses to worldwide coconut industry. Pest outbreaks are favored by plant intrinsic factors, such as continuous production of leaves and inflorescences, or extrinsic factors, including temperature, humidity, poorly conducted cultural dealings, and excessive use of pesticides leading to reduced populations of natural enemies.Homalinotus depressus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) occurs in the Antilles, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, and Suriname. H. depressus larvae construct galleries inside coconut trees, floral peduncle and stipe, thus interrupting the sap flow and promoting failing of flowers and fruits. In 2008, H. depressus was reported for the first time as a coconut pest in the Brazilian northern region. Management of H. depressus populations is largely based on applications of carbamates or organophosphates. Due to the lack of lures for trapping adult beetles, population densities are estimated by manual collections of beetles in the field. Therefore, semiochemicals, such as sex and/or aggregation pheromones, are highly desirable for trapping and possibly use in direct control strategies (e.g., mass trapping, attraction-and-kill, and mating disruption. Here, we describe the isolation, identification, and field evaluation of an aggregation pheromone produced by H. depressus.","Homalinotus depressus pupal chambers and adults were collected in a commercial coconut farm (Socôco Farm – Mojú/PA, Brazil, −1.91, −48.76). Collected insects were sent to Laboratory of Semiochemicals at UFPR, Curitiba/PR-Brazil. Adults were sexed and maintained under laboratory conditions (28 °C, 85% RH, 12 h Light: 12 h Dark) and fed on sugarcane which was replaced every 72 hours.Volatiles were collected by aeration method. Five insects of each sex were conditioned separately inside of cylindrical chambers (30 cm (length) × 12 cm (ID)) containing a 10 × 2 × 2 cm piece of sugarcane. Charcoal filtered and humidified air flow (1 L.min−1) was applied inside the chambers in the upward direction. The released volatiles were absorbed by HayeSep D® filters (polydivinylbenzene, 795 m2.g−1, 80–100 mesh). Filters were extracted with hexane (200 µL) every 24 hours.The olfactometer consisted of a Y-shaped glass tube (4 × 40 cm) with two 20 cm arms. The odor sources, which consisted of pieces of filter paper (2 × 2 cm) impregnated with the synthetic compounds, natural extracts or hexane (control), were placed at the ends of the arms. An insect was introduced into the base of the olfactometer and the behavior of the insect was observed over 10 min. An insect walking against the air flow toward the odor source for more than 5 cm in any of the arms and remaining in the arm for more than 2 min was considered a response. An insect remaining in the main tube was considered to be no response. Each insect was tested only once, representing one replicate experiment. The odor source was replaced after every test. The experiments were performed between the 4th and 6th hours of the scotophase, the time of day of highest pheromone release. Insects that did not choose any of the arms were excluded from statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using a chi-square test processed on BioEstat software (version 5.0).Initially, four behavioral response experiments were performed; the responses of males to odors from males, males to odors from females, females to odors from males and females to odors from females. Each replicate was performed using 40 μL of extract of interest.Bioassays conducted to observe the biological activity of the stereomers of the synthetic major male-specific compound were performed using 20 μL (50 ng.μL−1) of each standard.GC-MS analysis were performed on a Shimadzu QP2010 Plus spectrometer, operating on electron impact mode (70 eV), coupled to a Shimadzu GC-2010.

The initial column temperature was 50 °C, maintained during 1 minute and increased to 270 °C at a 7 °C per minute rate remaining at this temperature for 5 minutes.GC-FTIR analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 coupled to a DiscovIR-GC (Spectra Analysis) detection system. The GC oven temperature was maintained at 100 °C during 1 minute, increased to 270 °C at 10 °C.min−1, and kept at this temperature for additional 10 minutes. Samples were eluted on a RTX-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Restek Chromatography Products, USA) at a 1 mL.min−1.Target analytes were coinjected with an n-alkanes series. The GC temperature started at 50 °C, and increased to 230 °C at a 3 °C/minute rate. Analyses were conducted using two different stationary phases, RTX-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Restek Chromatography Products, USA) and EC-WAX (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, GRACE, USA). Retention indexes were calculated based on van den Dool & Kratz method.GC analyses on enantioselective stationary phase were performed on a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph, equipped with a β-Dex 325 capillary column (25% 2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-TBDMS-β-cyclodextrin, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm, Supelco, USA) and a FID detector system. GC oven initial temperature was 50 °C, maintained during one minute. After this time, the temperature was increased to 130 °C (3 °C.min−1), and later to 230 °C (7 °C.min−1). The temperature was maintained at 230 °C during 5 additional minutes.A solution containing isophorone (2, 144.7 mmol, 20 g) in ethanol (250 mL), was added at 25 oC to an aqueous solution of NaOH (620 mg in 20.5 mL of H2O).

After the predetermined preiod, the samples were filtered to remove the lipase before GC analysis. Enantiomeric excesses and enantiomeric ratio were determined by enantioselective GC, as described above. Enantiomeric ratio was calculed based on the following equation:where: eep = enantiomeric excess of the product, and ees = enantiomeric excess of the remaining alcohol.To a 125 mL Erlenmeyer, containing THF (32 mL), vinyl acetate (1920 µL, 20.8 mmol), and the lipase AK “AMANO” 20 (1.280 g), was added the alcohol cis-3 (1.000 g, 6.4 mmol). The mixture was stirred on a rotatory shaker (37 °C, 150 rpm) during 24 hours. After this period, the lipase was filtered, and the solvent evaporated. The products were purified by flash chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate - 2:1), yielding 1R,2R,6S-3 (459 mg, 2.94 mmol, 46% yield) and 1S,2S,6R-6 (562 mg, 2.84 mmol, 44.5% yield). 1R,2R,6S-3 -[α]D = +35.0 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, 24 °C) - ee = 98.8%, and 1S,2S,6R-6 - [α]D = − 58.9 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, 24 °C) - ee = 75.7%.To a 125 mL Erlenmeyer, containing TBME (32 mL), vinyl acetate (1920 µL, 20.8 mmol), and the lipase PS “Amano” SD (1.280 g), was added the alcohol cis-3 (1.000 g, 6.4 mmol). The mixture was stirred on a rotatory shaker (37 °C, 150 rpm) during 24 hours. After this period, the lípase was filtered, and the solvent evaporated. The products were purified by flash chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate - 2:1), yielding 1R,2R,6S-3 (464 mg, 2.98 mmol, 46.6% yield) and 1S,2S,6R-6 (566 mg, 2.86 mmol, 44.8% yield). 1R,2R,6S-3 -[α]D = +20.54 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, 24 °C) - ee = 64.2%, and 1S,2S,6R-6 -[α]D = − 70.23 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, 24 °C) - ee = 97.6%.To a magnetic stirred round bottom flask, containing pyridine (60 µL), (1R,2R,6S)-3 (20 mg, 0.128 mmol), and dichloromethane (2 mL), was added Ac2O (60 µL, 0.65 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred duritng a period of 12 hours at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (5 mL) and the organic phase washed with saturated solution of NaHCO3, HCl 10%, and brine. The organic phase was dried with Na2SO4 and concentrated by vacuum. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate: 4/1), yielding (1R,2R,6S)-6 (22 mg, 0.110 mmol, 85% yield). 1R,2R,6S-6 -[α]D = +74.9 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, 24 °C) - ee = 98.5%. 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 0.87 (m, 3 H), 0.97–1.70 (m, 7 H), 2.03–2.07 (m, 3 H), 2.19 (s, 3 H), 3.09–3.16 (m, 1 H), 3.97–3.26 (m, 1 H). 13C NMR (50 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 22.0, 24.5, 26.4, 31.0, 31.1, 35.6, 42.2, 58.9, 59.8, 69.9, 166.4.

The resulting mixture was stirred during 3 hours at 5 °C and during 12 additional hours at 25 °C. After this period, HCl (10 mL, 5% in water) was added and the reaction stirred at 25 °C during 10 minutes. Methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure and the aqueous solution extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic phase was washed with brine and dried with Na2SO4. The solvent was removed by vacuum and the crude product purified by flash chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate: 2/1), yielding (1S,2S,6R)-3 (145 mg, 0.93 mmol, 92% yield).

The solvent of the resulting mixture was removed on a rotavapor at 60 °C. After complete removal of the solvent, the reaction was maintained on the rotavapor under the same temperature for additional 5 minutes. The resulting solid was then washed with dichloromethane, and the organic phase washed with aqueous Na2CO3 and brine and dried with sodium sulfate.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature during 3 hours, followed by the addition of dry diethyl ether (10 mL). The resulting dark mixture was filtered trough a 1:1 mxture of Celite® and sílica flash which was washed with diethyl ether (2 × 5 mL). The crude product was concentrated by vacuum and purified by flash chromatography (hexane – ethyl acetate – 8:2), yielding (1S,6S)-1 (0.52 mmol, 81 mg, ee = 87.5%, 82% yield).(1R,6R)-1 was prepared following the same procedure described for (1S,6S)-1, starting with (1S,2S,6R)-3 (100 mg, 0.64 mmol). (1R,6R)-1 was obtained in 84% yield (0.54 mmol, 83 mg, ee = 89.3%).Field experiments where preformed in Mojú-PA, Brazil (1°55′S 48°45′W). Two sugarcane pieces (~10 cm) were placed inside of 2 L PET bottles. Pitfall® traps were then placed on the top of the bottles. Ziploc® sachets (3 × 5 cm, 0.04 mm thickness, polyethylene) containing the different treatments were placed at the top of the traps. Eight different treatments were planned, with five repetitions each: A- cis-3 (100 mg) + sugarcane, B- trans-3 (100 mg) + sugarcane, C- Sugarcane (control), D- cis-3 (100 mg) + trans-3 (100 mg) + sugarcane, E- (1R,2R,6 S)-3 (50 mg) + sugarcane, F- cis-3 (100 mg) + 1 (10 mg) + 2 (10 mg) + 4 (10 mg) + sugarcane, G- 1 (200 mg) + sugarcane, H- 2 (200 mg) + sugarcane. Traps were randomly placed at the top of the coconut trees, with at least approximately 30 meters between then. Captured insects were counted every two days, during a period of six days.","Volatile compounds emitted by H. depressus (kept under laboratory conditions) were collected by aeration and the GC comparison of aeration extracts from males to similar extracts from females showed the presence of four male-specific compounds (Fig. 1).Y-tube olfactometer assays, performed with adults of both sexes, showed that volatile compounds from males were attractive to both sexes. By contrast, response of both males and females to airborne volatile collections from females did not differ significantly from the response to control (solvent only) (Fig. 2). We, therefore, surmised that the male-specific compounds are constituents of a sex aggregation pheromone and, consequently, pursued their identification.Retention indexes (RIs) for the four natural products were calculated on RTX-5 (1–1096, 2–1119, 3–1127, 4–1158) and EC-WAX (1–1540, 2–1584, 3–1789, 4–1660) capillary columns.The mass spectrum for compound 2 showed a base peak at m/z 82, and a possible M+ at m/z 138 (Fig. 3, MS2). Its infrared spectrum suggests a trisubstituted alkene due to the C=C stretching (1640 cm−1) associated with a band at 3036 cm−1 (C-H stretching on alkenes) (Fig. 3, IR2). Two relatively intense bands were observed at 2959 and 2941 cm−1, due to asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching from CH3, thus indicating the occurrence of a branched CH3 moiety. An intense band was additionally observed at 1668 cm−1, suggesting the presence of an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Both IR and mass spectra were very similar to the spectra of 3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-2-enone (isophorone). Another similarity between isophorone and compound 2 was the RI (1117 for isophorone on a DB-5 column. Isophorone was first described in insects as a component of the defensive froth emitted by the grasshopper Romalea micropterais, and more recently described as an allelochemical eliciting oviposition repellence on The Navel Orangeworm (Ameylois transitella). The structure of 2 was subsequently confirmed to be isophorone by comparing its retention time, and mass and IR spectra with those of an authentic standard.The mass spectrum of compound 1 suggested a structure closely related to isophorone, with a base peak occurring at m/z 83 and a putative M+ ion at m/z 154, indicating a C9H14O2 molecular formula (Fig. 3, MS1). IR spectrum for this compound contained a C=O stretching band at 1722 cm−1 and three bands related to an epoxide: 3006 cm−1 (C-H stretching on epoxide carbon) and the pair of bands 1255 and 913 cm−1 (symmetric and asymmetric stretching of epoxide ring) (Fig. 3, IR1). Based on these data, compound 1 was proposed to be 4,4,6-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (epoxyisophorone) and then confirmed by synthesis, specifically, oxidation of isophorone with H2O2 in 89% yield.The IR spectrum obtained from compound 3 showed O-H and a C-O stretching bands at 3300 and 1025 cm−1 respectively, suggesting the presence of a hydroxyl group, as well a band at 1025 cm−1 related to the axial deformation of C-O bond, indicating the presence of a hydroxyl in the structure (Fig. 3, IR3). The retention indexes (RI) calculated for this compound was 1127 on a RTX-5 column, and 1789 on an EC-WAX column. The difference between these two RIs is 656 units, while the difference expected for the presence of one hydroxyl group would be around 500. These data suggest the contribution of an additional polar group in the structure. On the other hand, the mass spectrum for 3 showed a base peak at m/z 43, 141 as the highest m/z fragment, and 123 as a possible loss of water from 141 (Fig. 3, MS3). Additionally, the data suggested 141 as being related to the M+-15 and compound 3 as being a C9H16O2. Based on this dataset, the structure of 3 was proposed to be 4,4,6-trimethyl-7-oxa-bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-ol. A mixture of all four possible stereoisomers in a ratio of 3:1 (trans:cis) was synthesized starting from 1, by a solvent free reduction with NaBH4 in the presence of boric acid in 85% yield (Fig. 4).Compound 3 is a novel natural product, being reported several times only as a synthetic derivative obtained during development of epoxidation or carbonyl reduction methodologies. In this way, compound 3 was named “homalinol” derived from the Homalinotus genus.The diversity of recognition forms of chirality by living organisms reveals the importance of the stereochemistry studies of semiochemicals, being a target of research on insect behavior over the past five decades. The relative natural configuration of homalinol (3) was studied first by reducing epoxyisophorone (1) with freshly prepared zinc borohydride, producing trans-homalinol (trans-3) in 87% yield as a mixture of trans-3:cis-3 (99:1) (Fig. 5, Pathway A). Zinc borohydride is widely used as a hydride source for reductions of α and β-hydroxyketones and α,β-epoxyketones due to the strong chelating effect of zinc.Racemate cis-3 was obtained starting from the reduction of 2 to isophorol (5) with LiAlH4 in 95% yield followed by epoxidation with freshly prepared monoperphtalic acid (MPPA), resulting on a mixture of cis-3:trans-3 (99:1) (Fig. 5, Pathway B). The stereoselectivity of this reaction can be rationalized as a mechanism correlated to that proposed for the Prilezhaev reaction, where the epoxidation occurs in a concerted manner, with interaction between the hydroxyl hydrogen from 5 and the carboxylic oxygen of the peroxyacid from MPPA. The relative configuration of trans-3 and cis-3, obtained stereoselectively as described above, was determined based on their respective NMR spectra and previously reported data.Enantioselective GC analysis resulted in the resolution of the four stereoisomers of 3, allowing us to determine that the natural compound from H. depressus is a single enantiomer of the cis-3 mixture, (1R,2R,6S)-3 or (1S,2S,6R)-3 (Figure S1). Assays aiming the enantioselective synthesis of (1R,2R,6S)-3 and (1S,2S,6R)-3 were performed by kinetic resolution employing the lipases CAL-B (from Candida antarctica), AY “Amano” 30 (from C. rugosa), AK “Amano” 20 (from Pseudomonas fluorescens), PS “Amano” SD (from Burkholderia cepacia), and PPL (porcine pancreatic lipase) and four different organic media: TBME, hexane, vinyl acetate and THF. Vinyl acetate was used as acetate source in all tested conditions (Fig. 6A).Results obtained by CAL-B catalysis were not satisfactory, given that good conversion rates but with low enantioselectivity were obtained. The best result using CAL-B was obtained with 24 hours of reaction with THF as solvent, with ee’s of 43.6% for the remaining alcohol and 60.8% for the acetate formed. Reactions employing AY “Amano” 30 and PPL were not satisfactory either, due to conversion rates (c) lower that 5% even after nine days of reaction. On the other hand, better results were found in trials employing PS “Amano” SD and AK “Amano” 20, as shown on Table S1. PS “Amano” SD assays resulted in excellent enantiomeric excesses for the acetate formed and consequently satisfactory enantiomeric ratios (E). It must be highlighted that the reaction employing PS “Amano”SD and TBME in 24 hours resulted in the acetylated product with ee 98,6% (c = 39,9%, E > 200). Reactions using AK “Amano” 20 resulted in excellent ee for the remaining alcohol with the best result found using THF in 24 hours, resulting in a mixture containing the alcohol with ee 99,9% (c = 55,5%, E = 65). PS “Amano” SD and AK “Amano” 20 were employed on preparative scale in order to obtain higher amounts of the acetylated product and the remaining alcohol respectively, as shown on Fig. 6B.The only stereoisomer of 3 with absolute stereochemistry previously studied was (1S,2S,6R)-3, which was assigned by NMR of the Mosher’s ester derivative, where the specific rotation found was [α]D24 = −18.8 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, ee = 38%). The alcohol and acetate from each kinetic resolution were purified by flash chromatography in order to obtain samples of enantiomerically enriched compounds 3 and 6. The specific rotation of [α]D24 = + 35.0 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, ee = 98.8%) was found for the remaining alcohol, confirming its absolute configuration as (1R,2R,6S). The alcohol (1S,2S,6R)-3 was synthesized from the basic hydrolysis of (1S,2S,6R)-6 in 92% yield (Fig. 6C), showing an [α]D24 = −34.5 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, ee = 97.5%).This is the first case of description of compounds (1S,2S,6R)-6 and (1R,2R,6S)-6 as enantiomerically enriched compounds. The acetate (1S,2S,6R)-6 showed an [α]D24 = −70.2 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, ee = 97.6%) after isolation from kinetic resolution. The (1R,2R,6S)-6 enantiomer was obtained from (1R,2R,6S)-3, by treatment with acetic anhydride and pyridine in dichloromethane in 86% yield (Fig. 6C), showing an [α]D24 = +74.9 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, ee = 98.5%).Figure 7 illustrates chromatograms obtained by GC employing a β-Dex 325® capillary column. Traces for the resolution of the racemate of cis-3, as well as the elution of enantiomers (1R,2R,6S)-3 and (1S,2S,6R)-3 are displayed. The analysis of the natural compound clearly demonstrated that it occurs as a single enantiomer which eluted with the same retention time of (1R,2R,6S)-3. Co-injection of (1R,2R,6S)-3 with the natural extract confirmed that indeed (1R,2R,6S) is the absolute configuration of this natural pheromone.The determination of the absolute configuration of epoxyisophorone (1) released by H. depressus began with the oxidation of alcohols (1S,2S,6R)-3 and (1R,2R,6S)-3 using PCC, resulting in (1R,6R)-1 (84% yield) and (1S,6S)-1 (82% yield) respectively. The synthetic racemate 1, the enantiomerically enriched (1R,6R)-1 and (1S,6S)-1, and the natural compound 1 were analyzed on the β-Dex 325® capillary column, showing that the natural compound 1 is 1S,6S, as expected due to the orientation of the epoxide group in the major component (3) (Figure S2).The IR spectrum of natural compound 4 (Fig. 3, IR4) showed an intense band at 3414 cm−1, characteristic of a hydroxyl group with a intramolecular hydrogen bond. A C=C stretching band was also observed at 1674 cm−1. On the other hand, no bands from hydrogen attached to sp2 carbons were observed, suggesting the presence of a tetrasubstituted double bond. Mass spectra obtained for this compound showed similarities with the spectra obtained for compounds 1–3, a molecular ion peak at m/z 154 and the base peak at m/z 70 (Fig. 3, MS4). These spectral data were closely related to 2-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-2-enone (2-hydroxyisophorone), which was synthesized from (1), in 60% yield under solvent free conditions (Fig. 8). The synthetic standard coeluted with the natural compound, with identical mass and IR spectra, confirming the structure of the natural compound as the diosphenol 2-hydroxyisophorone (4). Compound 4 has been described previously as component of saffron (Crocus sativus) and different types of honey. However, this is the first case of occurrence in animals.Y-tube olfactometer bioassays performed with male and female H. depressus showed attractiveness of cis-3 to both sexes, while trans-3 and a mixture of cis-3 and trans-3 (1:1 w/w) significantly attracted only males when compared to hexane controls (Table S2).Figure 9 shows the field assay results, with the mean number of insects caught in each treatment. Traps containing only isophorone (2), epoxyisophorone (1), or hexane (control) did not catch any insects, while traps containing rubber septa with trans-3, cis-3 + trans-3 (1:1 w/w), or cis-3 captured insects, but the results are not statistically different from treatments with no captures. Traps baited with cis-3, (1R,2R,6S)-3, or the complete mixture (cis-3 + 1 + 2 + 4) were significantly more attractive to insects than the other treatments but did not differ between themselves. These results showed that both, the racemate of the major component (cis-3), the pure naturally produced enantiomer ((1R,2R,6S)-3), and the mixture containing the four male-specific compounds were active under field conditions and may be used as lures for practical applications.Although the field experiment showed that the male-specific compounds are bioactive on attractiveness of conspecifics, additional field experiments are needed, to optimize operational parameters such as dose/release rate, blend ratios, and trap type.In summary, this study resulted in the identification, synthesis and field evaluation of four male specific compounds released by H. depressus and used as an aggregation pheromone. These compounds were identified as (1S,6S)-epoxyisophorone ((1S,6S)-1), isophorone (2), (1R,2R,6S)-homalinol ((1R,2R,6S)-3), and 2-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-one (4). These compounds represent a new class of structures for Curculionidae aggregation pheromones.",,

All compoundswere tested the anti-inflammatory activity against human COX-2 protein, amongwhich, compounds 2 and 3 displayed activities with IC(50) values 123.00 µM and93.45 µM, respectively. The interaction mechanism was interpreted by moleculardocking.","Chen, Xiao-Dan, Li, Xin, Li, Xiao-Ming, Yang, Sui-Qun, Wang, Bin-Gui",2024,Marine drugs,2,False,False,True,"The harsh environment in the deep sea forces the benthic microbes to develop sophisticated molecular adaptations in their primary and secondary metabolic pathways. Cold seep is one of the most unique and extraordinary ecosystems in the deep sea. The microorganisms inhabiting in the cold seep environment were able to produce unconventional secondary metabolites with diverse and abundant biosynthetic gene clusters. Eremophilane and acorane are two classes of sesquiterpenes with diverse structures, and are widely produced by various microorganisms, especially by fungal species. These metabolites were reported to exhibit multiple biological activities, such as antibacterial, anti-fungal, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory activities.We previously investigated the deep-sea cold-seep-derived fungus Furcasterigmium furcatum CS-280 and characterized several polyketide and ascochlorin derivatives with antibacterial activities from the rice solid culture of the fungus. Co-cultivation was proved as an effective method to activate microbial biosynthetic genes which were silent under standard laboratory culture conditions. There are several reports on co-cultivation experiments of fungi and heat-killed bacteria, leading to the discovery of new secondary metabolites, such as a series of sugar alcohol-conjugated acyclic sesquiterpenes and 16-residue peptaibols from the sponge-derived fungus Acremonium sp. cultivated with heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the present report, the fungus F. furcatum CS-280 was co-cocultured with autoclaved Pseudomonas aeruginosa QDIO-4 for chemical investigation. As a result, six new sesquiterpenes, including four eremophilane derivatives fureremophilanes A–D (1–4) and two acorane analogues furacoranes A and B (5 and 6), were characterized (Figure 1). This paper describes the isolation, structure determination, stereochemical assignment, and bioactivity evaluation of the isolated compounds.","Detailed information for the apparatus, reagents, solvents, and materials used in the present work is the same as that described in our previous publication. Optical rotations were measured in MeOH using an Optical Activity AA-55 polarimeter (Optical Activity Ltd., Cambridgeshire, UK). UV spectra were measured on a PuXi TU-1810 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shanghai Lengguang Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). ECD spectra were acquired on a Chirascan spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Surrey, UK). 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded at 500 and 125 MHz for 1H and 13C, respectively, on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer with TMS as internal standard (Bruker Biospin Group, Karlsruhe, Germany). Mass spectra were determined on an API QSTAR Pulsar 1 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Analytical and semi-preparative HPLC were performed using a Dionex HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with P680 pump, an ASI-100 automated sample injector, and a UVD340U multiple wavelength detector controlled by Chromeleon software (version 6.80). Commercially available Si gel (200–300 mesh, Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Qingdao, China), Lobar LiChroprep RP–18 (40–63 μm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and Sephadex LH–20 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for open column chromatography. All solvents used were distilled prior to use.The fungal strain Furcasterigmium furcatum CS-280 was isolated from sediment samples collected from the cold-seep environment of the South China Sea (depth 1183 m), in June 2020. The fungal strain was identified as Furcasterigmium furcatum (syn. Acremonium furcatum) according to its ITS region sequence, which is highly similar (98.93%) to that of Acremonium furcatum (LR026839.1). The sequence information of the fungus was deposited in GenBank with the accession no. OQ120564.1. The strain is preserved at the Key Laboratory of Experimental Marine Biology, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS). Detailed information for the isolation and identification of fungal strain F. furcatum CS-280 was described in the previous publication.For chemical investigations, the bacterial strain P. aeruginosa QDIO-4 was incubated in LB liquid medium (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g NaCl in 1 L distilled H2O, pH 7.0) at 37 °C, 200 rpm for 12 h, and then 10 mL of bacterial broth was inoculated into 200 × 1 L conical flasks with solid rice medium (100 g rice, 0.15 g corn syrup, 0.45 g peptone, 0.15 g methionine, and 150 mL naturally sourced and filtered seawater that was obtained from the Huiquan Gulf of the Yellow Sea near the campus of IOCAS) at room temperature. After 3 days, these flasks were autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min, and then a piece of the spore inoculum (~2 × 2 cm2) of the fungal strain F. furcatum CS-280, which was grown on PDA medium at 28 °C for 8 days, was introduced into the above mentioned autoclaved rice-substrate-containing flasks and further incubated for 44 days. The fermented rice substrate was extracted four times with EtOAc.The EtOAc extract was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to yield an organic extract (80.2 g), which was subjected to vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) over Si gel eluting with different solvents of increasing polarity from petroleum ether (PE) to MeOH to yield nine fractions (Frs. 1–9).Based on TLC and HPLC analysis, Fr. 4 (9.8 g) and Fr. 5 (6.2 g) were combined together for further isolation, yielding 9 subfractions (Frs. 4.1–4.9) by column chromatography (CC) over Lobar LiChroprep RP-18 with a MeOH–H2O gradient (from 10:90 to 90:10). Fr 4.3 was applied to CC on Si gel eluting with a PE–acetone gradient (from 15:1 to 5:1) and then purified by CC on Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) to yield compound 6 (2.0 mg). Fr. 6 (2.0 g) and Fr. 7 (16.0 g) were mixed together and then yielded nine subfractions (Frs. 6.1–6.9) by CC over Lobar LiChroprep RP-18 with a MeOH–H2O gradient (from 10:90 to 90:10). Fr. 6.2 was applied to CC on Si gel eluting with a PE–acetone gradient (from 5:1 to 1:1) and then purified by CC on Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) to yield compound 4 (5.0 mg). Fr. 6.3 was purified by semipreparative HPLC (Elite ODS-BP column, 10 μm; 20 × 250 mm; 41% MeOH–H2O, 12 mL/min) to obtain compounds 2 (2.3 mg) and 5 (2.1 mg), while the eluents of un-purified peaks were collected and dried in vacuum to get the remaining components, and were further purified by CC on Si gel eluting with a gradient CH2Cl2–MeOH, 100:1 to obtain compound 3 (3.0 mg). Fr 6.6 and 6.7 was applied to semipreparative HPLC (Elite ODS-BP column, 10 μm; 20 × 250 mm; 66% MeOH–H2O, 12 mL/min) and then was further purified by CC on Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) to yield compound 1 (2.0 mg).Fureremophilane A (1): colorless crystals (MeOH–H2O);  + 35.3 (c 0.17, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 200 (3.21), 220 (2.69) 245 (2.98) 280 (2.76) nm; ECD (0.68 mM, MeOH) λmax (Δε) 205 (+4.75), 242 (+12.43), 260 (+3.94), 281 (4.49) nm; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1 and Table 2; HRESIMS m/z 293.1751 [M + H]+ (C17H25O4, calcd 293.1747).Fureremophilane B (2): yellow oil;  + 31.3 (c 0.16, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 200 (3.12), 220 (2.49) 242 (2.43) 320 (2.11) nm; ECD (0.62 mM, MeOH) λmax (Δε) 200 (+8.38), 215 (0.99), 240 (+0.74) nm; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1 and Table 2; HRESIMS m/z 347.1469 [M + Na]+ (C17H24O6Na, calcd 347.1465); 325.1648 [M + H]+ (C17H25O6, calcd 325.1646).Fureremophilane C (3): colorless crystals (MeOH–EtOAc);  + 43.8 (c 0.16, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 200 (3.11), 220 (2.45) 283 (2.19) nm; ECD (0.62 mM, MeOH) λmax (Δε) 200 (+7.96) nm; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1 and Table 2; HRESIMS m/z 347.1462 [M + Na]+ (C17H24O6Na, calcd 347.1465).Fureremophilane D (4): colorless crystals (MeOH–H2O);  + 36.0 (c 0.25, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 203 (+3.94) nm; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1 and Table 2; HRESIMS m/z 289.1404 [M + Na]+ (C15H22O4Na, calcd 289.1410).Furacorane A (5): yellowish oil;  − 18.2 (c 0.11, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 200 (3.05) nm; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 3; HRESIMS m/z 255.1958 [M + H]+ (C15H27O3, calcd 255.1955).Furacorane B (6): yellowish oil;  +76.5 (c 0.17, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 200 (2.55) nm; ECD (4.24 mM, MeOH) λmax (Δε) 295 (+1.51) nm; H and 13C NMR data, see Table 3; HRESIMS m/z 254.2121 [M + NH4]+ (C15H28O2N, calcd 254.2115).Crystallographic data were collected on a Srigaku Mercury CCD/AFCR diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 78 Å) at 293(2) K. The data were corrected for absorption by using the program SADABS. The structure was solved by direct methods and subsequent difference Fourier synthesis and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques with the SHELXTL software package (2018). All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The absolute structures were determined by refinement of the Flack parameter.Crystal data of 1: m.p. 167–169 ℃; C17H24O4; F.W. = 292.36, Orthorhombic, P212121, unit cell dimensions a = 7.3305(2) Å, b = 9.8107(3) Å, c = 21.7397(6) Å, V = 1563.46(8) Å3, α = β = γ = 90°, Z = 4, dcalcd =1.242 mg/m3, crystal dimensions 0.160 × 0.140 × 0.120 mm, μ = 0.706 mm−1, F(000) = 632.0. The 15680 measurements yielded 2848 independent reflections after equivalent data were averaged, and Lorentz and polarization corrections were applied. The final refinement gave R1 = 0.0307 and wR2 = 0.0853 [I > 2σ(I)]. The Flack parameter was 0.09(5).Crystal data of 3: m.p. 170–172 ℃; C17H24O6; F.W. = 324.36, Trigonal, R3, unit cell dimensions a = 27.6010(6) Å, b = 27.6010(6) Å, c = 6.1835(2) Å, V = 4079.6(2) Å3, α = β = 90°, γ =120°, Z = 9, dcalcd =1.188 mg/m3, crystal dimensions 0.140 × 0.120 × 0.100 mm, μ = 0.743 mm−1, F(000) = 1566.0.

The final refinement gave R1 = 0.0309 and wR2 = 0.0843 [I > 2σ(I)]. The Flack parameter was 0.13(8).Conformational searches were carried out via molecular mechanics with the MM+ method in HyperChem 8.0 software. Afterward, the geometries were optimized at the gas-phase B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in Gaussian09 software to afford the energy-minimized conformers. Then, the optimized conformers were subjected to the calculations of ECD spectra and specific rotation value (λ = 589.4 nm) using the CAM-B3LYP/TZVP level. Solvent effects of the methanol solution were evaluated at the same DFT levels using the SCRF/PCM method. The calculated results were later obtained according to the Boltzmann weighting of each conformer.COX-2 inhibitory activity assay in vitro was performed by cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitor Screening Kit (Beyotime, Cat No. S0168, Shanghai, China). Briefly, the COX-2 enzyme was mixed with compound solution and then incluated at 37 °C for 10 min. After that, the COX-2 probe and substrate were added. Then, the fluorescence intensity values were measured with the excitation wavelength at 530 nm and the emission wavelength at 590 nm. The data was analyzed by GraphPad Prism5 (GraphPad Software Inc., Boston, MA, USA).The crystal structure of human COX-2 (PDB ID: 5IKR) was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank for molecular docking. The preparation, optimization, and interaction of compounds 1–4 and celecoxib bonding with COX-2 and legitimacy of their activities were elaborated by AutoDock software package (, accessed on 15 October 2024, Molecular Graphics Laboratory at the Department of Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute). AutoDock tools were employed to prepare both COX-2 and compounds for docking. Through AutoDock vina, binding free energy was calculated and compounds displaying the lowest binding affinity to protein were chosen as the best conformation. The visualizations of the protein-ligand structure were optimized by PyMol molecular graphics system.","Compound 1 was acquired as colorless crystals. Its chemical formula was assigned as C17H24O4 on the basis of the positive HRESIMS data at m/z 293.1751 (calculated for C17H25O4, [M + H]+, 293.1747), requiring six degrees of unsaturation. The 1H and 13C NMR data revealed the presence of five methyl groups, two sp3 methylenes, one sp2 and three sp3 methines (with two oxygenated), and six nonprotonated (with one sp3 and five sp2) carbons, along with an exchangeable proton (δH 5.05) (Table 1 and Table 2). Detailed analysis of the NMR data revealed that the structure of 1 was similar to (3S)-3-acetoxyeremophil-1(2),7(11),9(10)-trien-8-one, a known eremophilane sesquiterpene isolated from Penicillium roqueforti DAOM 232127, a fungus obtained from contaminated silage in Québec. However, signals for two olefinic methines CH-1 (δH 5.79 and δC 130.75) and CH-2 (δH 5.93 and δC 131.04) in the NMR spectra of the known compound were absent, while resonances for a sp3 methylene CH2-1 (δH 2.55/2.30 and δC 35.8) and an oxygenated methine CH-2 (δH 3.64 and δC 68.5) were observed in the NMR spectra of 1 (Table 1 and Table 2), which indicated that the Δ1(2)-double bond of the known compound was reduced in compound 1. Combined with the 1H-1H COSY correlations from H-2 to H2-1 and H-3 and to the proton of OH-2, and the key HMBC correlations from the proton of OH-2 to C-1 and from H2-1 to C-9 and C-10 (Figure 2), the planar structure of 1 was established. Due to absence of some diagnostic NOE correlations, its relative configuration could not be precisely assigned by NOESY experiment. The suitable crystals of 1 were obtained by slow evaporation of a mixed solvents (MeOH and H2O), allowing for the X-ray crystallographic analysis using Cu Kα radiation. The Flack parameter 0.09(5) permitted establishment of the absolute configurations as 2S, 3R, 4R, and 5R (Figure 3). Overall, the structure of 1 was determined and was given the trivial name fureremophilane A.It should be mentioned that searching the structure of compound 1 in CAS SciFinder database gave a result showing “a compound” (CAS number 1027589-47-4) has 100% similarity to compound 1. However, the structure of “as drawn” compound in the database has a double bond at Δ11(12), which was different from that of compound 1 (with a double bond at Δ7(11)), and no reference describing the structure and property for the “compound” (with CAS number 1027589-47-4) could be found.Compound 2 was isolated as yellow oil, of which the chemical formula was established as C17H24O6 by HRESIMS data. The 1H and 13C NMR data revealed the presence of four methyls, three methylenes, four methines, and six non-protonated carbons (Table 1 and Table 2). Discreet analyses of its NMR data revealed compound 2 had close relationship to 5-chloro-6-hydroxy-3a-methoxy-1a,8,8a-trimethyl-1a,2,3a,5,7,8,8a,9-octahydro-6H-naphtho [2,3-b]oxireno [2,3-c]furan-7-yl acetate, a chlorinated eremophilane sesquiterpene isolated from the fungal strain Penicillium sp. PR19N-1, which was obtained from antarctic deep-sea. However, there is no chlorine substitution in compound 2, as indicated by the HRESIMS data. The HMBC correlations from the exchangeable proton (δH 5.82, 8-OH) to C-7, C-8, and C-9 could illustrate that the methoxy group at C-8 in the reported compound also dismissed in 2. On the other hand, the double bond in compound 2 located at Δ1(10), as evidenced by the COSY correlations from the olefinic proton H-1 to the oxymehine proton H-2 as well as by the HMBC correlations from H-9 to C-1 and C-10 and from the proton of 2-OH to C-1 (Figure 2). The planar structure of compound 2 was thus determined (Figure 1).Compound 3 was isolated as colorless crystals and has same molecular formula as that of compound 2. The 1D and 2D NMR data revealed that compound 3 was reminiscent to compound 2 (Table 1 and Table 2). Supported by the COSY correlations from H-3 to the proton of 3-OH and H-2, by the HMBC correlation from H3-14 to C-3, and by the changes of chemical shifts of C-1, C-2, and C-3, the acetoxyl unit in 3 was supposed to be linked at C-2 instead of C-3 as that in 2 (Figure 2).The relative configurations at C-2, C-4, and C-5 of compounds 2 and 3 were established by NOESY cross-peaks from H3-14 to H3-15, from H-2 to H-4 (Figure 4). The small coupling constant between H-3 and H-4 (3JH-3, H-4 = 2.2 Hz) in 3 assigned cofacial relationship of these two protons, while the relative configuration of hydroxy unit at C-8 and the epoxide group at C-7/C-11 were deduced as α and β-orientations, respectively, from the prospect of biosynthesis. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment of compound 3 was carried out to further confirm the relative configurations, and the Flack parameter 0.08(4) unambiguously assigned its absolute configurations as 2S, 3R, 4R, 5R, 7R, 8R, and 11R (Figure 3). The configurations of compounds 2 and 3 were considered consistent from the biosynthetic point of view. Compounds 2 and 3 were named as fureremophilanes B and C, respectively.Compound 4 was obtained as colorless crystals and its HRESIMS data gave the molecular formula C15H22O4. The 1H and 13C NMR data resembled those of cryptosphaerolide, an ester-substituted (at C-1) eremophilane sesquiterpenoid characterized from the marine-sourced ascomycete fungal strain Cryptosphaeria sp. CNL-523. Detailed analysis of the NMR data of 4 showed that the ester moiety at C-1 in cryptosphaerolide is not present in compound 4. Instead, C-1 is a non-oxygenated methylene and a hydroxy group was linked directly to C-15 in compound 4, as verified by key 1H-1H COSY correlations from H2-2 to H2-1 and H2-3, from H-4 to H2-3 and H2-15, and from H2-15 to the proton of 15-OH (Figure 2). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment not only confirmed the structure of compound 4 but also established its absolute configuration as 4S, 5R, 7R, 8R, 9S, and 10S (Figure 3). Thus, compound 4 was assigned as a new eremophilane derivative and named as fureremophilane D.Furacorane A (5), obtained as yellowish oil, assigned the molecular formula C15H26O3 on the basis of HRESIMS data, indicating three degrees of unsaturation. Its 13C NMR data (Table 3) disclosed an acorane skeleton, which was similar to daphneaine C. The presence of cyclopentane moiety of 5 was assigned by COSY correlations (measured in DMSO-d6) from H-1 through H2-2, H-3, and H-4 to H3-15, while the correlations from H-11 to H-1, H-12, and H-13 verified the presence of an isopropyl unit at C-1 (Figure 2). The COSY correlations from H-3 to 3-OH indicated the hydroxyl attached to C-3 in 5 instead of C-2 in daphneaine C. In addition, the methyl group at C-8 (CH3-15) in daphneaine C was replaced by a hydroxymethyl unit in compound 5, as supported by the chemical shift of C-15 moving downfield significantly to δC 61.5 (C-15), along with the observed COSY from the proton of 15-OH to H2-15 (Figure 2) and the long distance COSY from H2-15 to H-9 (allylic coupling, 4J) and from H-7 and H2-15 to H-10a and H-10b (high allylic coupling, 5J) (Figure S39). For the severe overlapping of some signals, the 1H NMR, HSQC and NOESY spectra of compound 5 were re-measured in CDCl3 (Figures S41–S43). The NOE correlations from H-1 to H-3 and H3-14 and from H-3 to H3-14 implied their cofacial orientation (Figure 4). H-10a (δH 2.06), H-6b (δH 1.20), and H-7 were assigned cofacial, as determined by NOE correlations from H-10a to H-6b and from H-6b to H-7. Thus, the relative configurations at cyclopentane unit were established. NOE correlations from H-10a to H-4 and H3-14, from H-10b to H-1, and from H-6b to H3-14 revealed the H-10a, H-4, H3-14, H-6b and H-7 located on the same side of the cyclopentane unit, while H-10b and H-1 were on the other side. The relative configuration of 5 was thus established as shown (Figure 4).To determine the absolute configuration, the specific rotation (SR) at the CAM-B3LYP/TZVP level was calculated (Tables S1–S3 in the Supplementary Data). The calculated SR value [α]D –22.6 for (1S,3S,4S,5R,7S)-5 was in agreement with the experimental value of 5  –18.2 (c 0.11, MeOH), which allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration of 5 as 1S, 3S, 4S, 5R, and 7S.Furacorane B (6) was also obtained as yellowish oil. Its molecular formula was determined as C15H24O2 on the basis of (+)-HRESIMS data, with one O-atom less and one more degree of unsaturation than that of 5. In the 13C NMR of 6, a resonance corresponding to a ketonic carbonyl at δC 220.5 (C-3) was observed, and the location of this carbonyl carbon was determined at C-3 by the detected HMBC correlations from H-2, H-4, and H3-14 to C-3 (Figure 2). The chemical shift of C-15 shifted from δC 61.5 in 5 to the upfield at δC 19.7 in 6, revealing the absence of -OH at C-15 (Table 3). Unfortunately, it is infeasible to determine the relative configuration by NOESY spectrum due to the special spiral ring system and the severe signal overlapping. The relative configuration of 6 was established the same as 5 owing to the same biosynthetic pathway. To further verify the absolute configuration of 6, ECD calculation was performed at the CAM-B3LYP/TZVP level in Gaussian 09. The experimental curve matched well with that of the calculated ECD spectrum for 1S, 4S, 5R, 7S-6 (Figure 5), both with positive Cotton effects around 295 nm. Thus, the absolute configuration of 6 was finally assigned as 1S, 4S, 5R, 7S.The biosynthetic relationship of all isolated compounds (1–6) biosynthesis of compounds 1–6 was proposed as shown in Figure S54. Briefly, the eremophilane sesquiterpene core (I) and acorenyl cation (XI), both derived from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), were considered as substrates to produce compounds 1–6 through a series of biochemical transformations, such as hydroxylation, isomerization, epoxidation, and acetylation.Cyclooxygenases 2 (COX-2) is involved in the key step of the converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which are considered as therapeutic targets for many inflammatory related diseases. Compounds with similar structures as described in the present work showed anti-inflammatory activities, so all of the isolated compounds (1–6) were screened for their anti-inflammatory activity at 100 µM towards COX-2 in vitro, among which, the eremophilane derivatives 2 and 3 were further assayed with concentration gradients and showed slight inhibitory effects with IC50 values 123.00 and 93.45 µM, respectively (Figure 6), whereas compounds 1 and 4–6 did not show any activities during the assays. Moreover, none of the isolated compounds showed any antimicrobial activities against agricultural pathogenic fungal strains Ceratobasidium cornigerum QDAU-6, Botrytis cinerea QDAU-23, Fusarium oxysporum QDAU-5, and aquatic pathogenic bacterial strains Escherichia coli EMBLC-1, Vibrio anguillarum QDIO-6, Vibrio harveyi QDIO-7. As well, the inhibitory activities against neuraminidase and angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) were also tested and no obvious activities were observed.A molecular docking study was performed to identify the intermolecular interaction and potential binding sites of the eremophilane derivatives 1–4 and the positive control celecoxib with COX-2 (PDB ID:5IKR) (Figure 7A). The results demonstrated that compound 3 interacted with COX-2 in the same active pocket with that of celecoxib (Figure 7D), which formed four key hydrogen bonds with residues Asn-43, Arg-44, and Cys-47, while celecoxib formed hydrogen bonds with residues His-39 and Gln-461 (Figure 7C,D). Hence, the huge variation of the inhibition activities might be implicated by their different nature of interactions with different residues of COX-2. In contrast, compound 2 was observed to form three hydrogen bonds with residues Arg-120 and Ala-527 (Figure 7B). The different locations of acetoxyl group in 2 and 3 exhibited great influence on the binding sites.",,"Six new sesquiterpenes, including four eremophilane derivatives, fureremophilanes A–D (1–4), and two acoranes, furacoranes A and B (5 and 6), were characterized from the culture extract of the cold-seep derived fungus Furcasterigmium furcatum CS-280 cultured on autoclaved P. aeruginosa QDIO-4. The compounds with more variable structures were isolated from the extract of co-culture medium, while at the same time, the identified compounds were highly oxidized and compounds 2 and 3 had rare epoxyethane and tetrahydrofuran ring systems among the known sesquiterpenes. Compounds 2 and 3 displayed inhibitory activities against human COX-2 activity with IC50 values 123.00 and 93.45 µM, respectively. The molecular docking experiment was carried out to explain their distinct activities. Compound 3 was considered to be engaged in the same active pocket with celecoxib, while the different binding residues lead to the difference in the inhibitory activities of COX-2 in vitro, and the different locations of acetyl group in 2 and 3 exhibited great influence on the binding sites."
15,TA036608,10.1590/1678-775720150540,Effects of budlein A on human neutrophils and lymphocytes.,"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated whether budlein A modulates the activationof innate and adaptive immune cells such as neutrophils and lymphocytes. MATERIALAND METHODS: Our research group has investigated several plant species andseveral compounds have been isolated, identified, and their medical potentialevaluated. Budlein A is a SL isolated from the species Aldama buddlejiformis andA. robusta (Asteraceae) and shows anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptiveactivities. Advances in understanding how plant-derived substances modulate theactivation of innate and adaptive immune cells have led to the development of newtherapies for human diseases. RESULTS: Budlein A inhibited MPO activity, IL-6,CXCL8, IL-10, and IL-12 production and induces neutrophil apoptosis. In contrast,budlein A inhibited lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2, IL-10, TGF-β, and IFN-γproduction, but it did not lead to cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, ourresults indicate that budlein A shows distinct immunomodulatory effects on immunecells.","Knob, Carollinie Dias, Silva, Milena, Gasparoto, Thaís Helena, Oliveira, Carine Ervolino, Amôr, Nádia Ghinelli, Arakawa, Nilton Syogo, Costa, Fernando Batista, Campanelli, Ana Paula",2016,Journal of applied oral science : revista FOB,2,False,False,True,"The ability of the immune system to respond to a variety of stimuli is central to its function in pathogen clearance and tissue repair. The immune homeostasis and control of inflammation in different pathological settings is maintained by the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling, and most research has focused on understanding the mechanisms that regulate the immune response      . New therapeutic agents are currently under investigation for pathological conditions in which the balance between activation and suppression of the immune response has failed. Studies have shown that plant-derived compounds have immunomodulatory effects without direct immunosuppressive action such as clinically used corticosteroids      . However, the mere isolation of new naturally-occurring anti-inflammatory agents does not necessarily lead to a drug until the exact mechanism of action and their possible toxic effects are completely determined. Moreover, many biologically active compounds that do not afford a new drug or even a principal compound can be used as prototypes for the study of the mechanisms involved in a certain biological effect. Budlein A, a sesquiterpene lactone (SL) formerly isolated from the Central American species Aldama buddlejiformis (DC) and more recently from the South American A. robusta Gardner (Asteraceae), has been described as presenting anti-inflammatory activity    . Recent studies have shown its anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities in mice  . Although this information is important for determining its properties, it provides restricted parameters about how this compound affects other cells, adaptive immune response and T cell compartment. An immunomodulatory substance might show antibacterial activity, but the induced cell death could also be harmful to immune responses, pathogen clearance and tissue repair  . In this context, research to develop new anti-inflammatory agents to control the damage and exacerbated inflammation mediated, in part, by lymphocyte activation, has been stimulated. Given the broad information relating SLs and immunomodulation, we should evaluate whether budlein A modulates the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells.","Budlein A (MW=374.1365) was isolated from the leaves of Viguiera robusta, as previously described. Its chemical structure was determined by means of spectrometric analysis, i.e., IR, 1H, and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry as well as comparison with an authentic sample and data reported in literature. Analytical procedures using spectroscopy and chromatographic techniques indicated that the purity of budlein A used in this study ranged between 95-98%. Prior to the bioassays, budlein A was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (SIGMA – St. Louis, MO, USA) (0.1% in RPMI 1640 medium – GIBCO – Grand Island, NY, USA).We used peripheral blood from 30 healthy volunteers (17 men and 13 women; age ranged between 27-50 years). All subjects had no active diseases at the time of phlebotomy. All subjects signed an informed consent releasing the use of blood for research purposes approved by the Bauru School of Dentistry, University of São Paulo.Peripheral blood was harvested with heparin (50 U/ml) from healthy subjects. Both groups of leukocytes were layered over two different density Histopaque gradients (SIGMA) and centrifuged for 30 min at 450X g. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from the first layer (onto Histopaque 1077) and neutrophils were isolated from the second buffy coat layer (onto Histopaque 1119). Cells were then washed twice with Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) at 200 X g for 10 min before being quantified. Viability of the cells was >99% viable when assessed by Trypan blue exclusion.Neutrophils (1x10/well) from healthy donors were cultured in 24-well plates, in presence of medium only, or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 ng/mL), N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP) (1.5 µM) in presence or absence of different concentrations of budlein A (1, 10 or 100 µM) or dexamethasone (100 µM).Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE) (Invitrogen – Eugene, OR, USA) labeled-PBMC (1x10/well) from healthy donors were cultured in 24-well plates, in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) (1 µg/ml) (SIGMA), or in presence or absence of different concentrations of budlein A (1, 10, or 100 µM) or dexamethasone (100 µM), at 37°C and 5% CO2. On day 4, the cells were harvested and the proliferative response of T cells was assessed by measuring the CFSE dilution using flow cytometry. The proliferation of T cells was characterized by sequential halving of CFSE fluorescence, generating equally spaced peaks on a logarithmic scale. The data represents the percentage of proliferation of T cells. The cell acquisition was performed on a FACSort flow cytometer using CellQuest software (BD Biosciencess – San Diego, CA, USA).Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was determined by enzymatic reaction, as previously described. Neutrophils were harvested after culture and centrifuged at 350X g for 15 min, and the pellet was frozen at -20°C. The pellet was then liquefied and centrifuged twice at 10,000X g for 15 min at 4°C. The MPO activity in the suspended pellet was assayed by measuring the change in absorbance at 450 nm using tetramethylbenzidine (1.6 mM) and H2O2 (0.5 mM) (BD Biosciences).Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10, IL-12, Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β, and Interferon (IFN)-γ levels were measured using ELISA kits (BD Biosciences or R&D Systems – Minneapolis, MN, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Cells were harvested after culture and the viability was analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from the proportion of neutrophils, as well as lymphocyte positivity for Annexin- V-FITC or propidium iodide (ApoScreen™ Annexin V-FITC kit, SouthernBiotech – Birmingham, AL, USA), in relation to total number of cells.Values are presented as mean±SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s multiple comparison test (INSTAT Software; GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA, USA). All values were considered significant when p≤0.05.","To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of budlein A on neutrophils, cells were stimulated with fMLP or LPS in presence or absence of budlein A (1, 10, or 100 µM) or dexamethasone (positive control), and the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10, and IL-12 production and apoptosis were analyzed. Consistent with prior observation, budlein A inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the MPO activity by LPS-stimulated-neutrophils (Fig. 1A). Our results also indicate that at a concentration of 10 and 100µM, budlein A reduced MPO activity by fMLP-stimulated neutrophils (Figure 1A).Because neutrophils appear to be important producers of cytokines during innate immune response and cytokines are important mediators of the inflammatory process, we assessed whether budlein A affects cytokine and chemokine production by neutrophils (Figure 1B). Unstimulated neutrophils produced basal levels of IL-6, IL-10, CXCL8, and IL-12. Budlein A decreased CXCL8 production, induced IL-10 production and did not alter IL-12 and IL-6 production by unstimulated neutrophils. After 21 h of culture, LPS and fMLP enhanced IL-6, CXCL8, IL-12, and IL-10 production by human neutrophils. In contrast, budlein A inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner IL-6 and CXCL8 production by fMLP and LPS-stimulated neutrophils. Moreover, budlein A, at only 100 µM concentration, inhibited IL-10 and IL-12 production by fMLP and LPS-stimulated-neutrophils, while at 10 µM it inhibited IL-12 production by LPS-activated neutrophils (Figure 1B). To verify whether the results were the consequence of cell death, we analyzed the apoptosis of neutrophils. Our data showed that only budlein A at 100 µM concentration significantly induced neutrophil apoptosis (33.19±5.70%), similar to that observed after culture with dexamethasone (22.83±0.51%) (Figure 1C). Similar results were observed when fMLP or LPS-stimulated neutrophils were treated with budlein A (100 µM) (Figure 1C).To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of budlein A on lymphocytes, cells were cultured with PHA in presence or absence of budlein A (1, 10, or 100 µM) or dexamethasone (positive control), and proliferation, IL-2, IL-10, IFN-γ, and TGF-β production and apoptosis were analyzed. Lymphocytes exhibit proliferative response after PHA stimulation, and the addition of budlein A (100 µM) significantly reduced T cell proliferation (Figure 2A). These results indicate that budlein A interferes with PHA-induced T cell proliferation. Regarding cytokine production, the results evidenced that budlein A (100 µM) decreased IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β production by PHA-stimulated lymphocytes, with similar effects to dexamethasone (Figure 2B).Since budlein A negatively modulates the secretion of cytokines by PHA-stimulated lymphocytes, and this could be a consequence of cell death, their apoptosis was evaluated (Figure 2C). We found that budlein A (1, 10, or 100 µM) does not induce lymphocyte apoptosis (Figure 2C). These data indicate that budlein A exerts an important role against lymphocytes’ activation, but it did not induce cell death.","Although budlein A has been described as presenting anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity    , specific effects of this compound on immune cells are lacking. In the present study, we demonstrated that budlein A inhibit neutrophils activation and induce cell death, but, despite also inhibiting lymphocyte activation, it did not induce lymphocyte death.Budlein A inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the release of biochemical mediators by neutrophils, and this activity could possibly reduce tissue damage caused by the enzyme  . The MPO activity can be deleterious to the host, and it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases. Myeloperoxidase has also been established as a risk factor for many forms of cancer via its ability to damage/mutate cellular DNA or indirectly via its pro-inﬂammatory role  . The anti-inflammatory activity of SL is mediated via the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) by the alkylation of the cysteine residue in the p65 subunit, impairing its activation and the consequent production of inflammatory mediators  .Another important effect of budlein A on neutrophils shown in this study was the inhibition of IL-6, CXCL-8, IL-10, and IL-12 production. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CXCL8, and IL-12) are involved in the initiation and amplification of the immune response, and anti-inflammatory cytokines modulate the late events to control the immune response. The imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine activities favors chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases    . Imbalance in the production of inflammatory cytokines may allow a local inflammation to become an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response    .Because low cytokine production might have occurred as a consequence of cytotoxic effects exerted by budlein A, we analyzed the apoptosis of human neutrophils. Only budlein A, at the 100 µM concentration, induces neutrophils apoptosis. The death of neutrophils observed in this study may be due to the absence of growth factors, particularly CXCL8, since budlein A, as well as other sesquiterpenes, inhibits activation of NF-κB and the production of cytokines related to neutrophil survival  . In fact, 1 µM of budlein A did not significantly induce neutrophil apoptosis, but it did not significantly inhibit the production of CXCL8 either. Another possible explanation could be a direct influence of the substance in neutrophil survival. Death of neutrophil induced by budlein A could be harmful to immune response, pathogen clearance, and tissue repair  . Neutrophils are involved with different inflammatory diseases and their apoptosis might generate an anti-inflammatory microenvironment as well. The precise regulation of neutrophil apoptosis is essential for resolution of inflammation, since this prevents the release of toxic intracellular components that can damage healthy tissues      . Thus, anti-inflammatory agents that induced neutrophil apoptosis would only be helpful in some chronic inflammatory diseases, since these diseases present persistent inflammatory mediators avoiding their resolution    . A plethora of those inflammatory mediators (i.e., the reactive oxygen species or neutrophil extracellular traps) is produced by viable neutrophils  . These mediators could influence autoimmune diseases at different levels and by different ways, such as directly through the inhibition of cytokines, modulating their production or damaging surrounding tissues  . Several diseases seem to be affected by activated neutrophils, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)    . Hence, reduced numbers of activated neutrophils might generate a protected microenvironment from dramatic consequences from their uncontrolled inflammation.Interestingly, despite previous studies having shown that high concentrations of sesquiterpene lactones induced apoptosis of PBMC, we did not find any significant change in lymphocyte death using three different concentrations of budlein A. Budlein A at 100 µM significantly inhibited PHA-proliferation of lymphocytes as well as IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β production. Other studies have described a significant inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation via other sesquiterpenes; however, the viability rate of the cells had not been evaluated. Here, inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation might be a consequence of undetectable levels of IL-2, an important cytokine inducing lymphocyte proliferation. Thus, budlein A might be an important inhibitor of uncontrolled lymphocyte proliferation without inducing their apoptosis. Such situation would facilitate their use in diseases without directly affecting their survival.Therefore, our results also show that budlein A induced apoptosis of neutrophils but not lymphocytes, and indicate that budlein A shows distinct immunomodulatory effects on immune cells (Figure 3).","The anti-inflammatory activities mediated by budlein A reveal an important potential to the study of mechanisms of action and therapeutics  . In the present study, we demonstrated that budlein A inhibits neutrophil activation and induces cell death, but, despite also inhibiting lymphocyte activation, it did not induce lymphocyte death. Further studies are necessary to understand the significance of this compound in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. It will be of interest to evaluate how the balance between these positive and negative effects could be regulated during the course of the immune response."
16,TA042038,10.3390/molecules28030941,Comprehensive Identification of Ginsenosides in the Roots and Rhizomes of Panaxginseng Based on Their Molecular Features-Oriented Precursor Ions Selection andTargeted MS/MS Analysis.,"Panax ginseng is widely used in Asian countries and its activeconstituents-ginsenosides-need to be systematically studied. However, only asmall part of ginsenosides have been characterized in the roots and rhizomes ofpanax ginseng (RRPG) up to date, mainly because of a lack of the fragmentationions of many more ginsenosides. In order to comprehensively identify ginsenosidesin RRPG, molecular features of ginsenosides orienting precursor ions selectionand targeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis strategy were proposed inour study, in which the precursor ions were selected according to the molecularfeatures of ginsenosides irrespective of their peak abundances, and targetedMS/MS analysis was then performed to obtain their fragmentation ions forsubstance characterization. Using this strategy, a total of 620 ginsenosides weresuccessfully characterized in RRPG, including 309 protopanaxadiol-typeginsenosides, 258 protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides and 53 oleanane-typeginsenosides. It is worth noting that, except for the known aglyconesmass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 459, 475 and 455, twelve other aglycones, includingm/z 509, 507, 493, 491, 489, 487, 477, 473, 461, 457, 443 and 441, were firstreported in our experiment and they were probably the derivatizations of theprotopanaxatriol and protopanaxadiol. Our study will not only help people toimprove the cognition of ginsenosides in RRPG, but will also play a guiding andreference role for the isolation and characterization of potentially newginsenosides from RRPG.","Wang, Hong-Ping, Wang, Zi-Jian, Du, Jing, Lin, Zhao-Zhou, Zhao, Chen, Zhang, Run, Yin, Qiong, Fan, Chun-Lan, Peng, Ping, Wang, Zhi-Bin",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"Known as the king of herbs and a tonic, panax ginseng is widely used in Asian countries. With the development of evidence-based medicine and/or evidence-based pharmacy, analysis and identification of active constituents in panax ginseng are fundamental sciences needing to be addressed and systematically studied. Some modern research relevant to biological activities and pharmacological actions of panax ginseng have been reported, such as anti-tumor, improvement of immune function, regulation of central nervous system, protection effect on cerebral ischemia, anti-aging, etc. Based on a large number of published papers, the above-mentioned biological activities and pharmacological actions are all correlated with ginsenosides, a group of components that are regarded as the characteristic constituents of the roots and rhizomes of panax ginseng (RRPG), needing to be comprehensively analyzed.Until now, there are mainly two approaches for studies on chemical substances of ginsenosides from RRPG. One is the chemical separation method, in which ginsenoside monomer is obtained from the extract of RRPG through separation and purification technology, and its exact structure can be concluded according to its spectral data. However, some ginsenosides with minor amounts will be lost during the progress of separation, and usually ginsenosides with high amounts will be separated and characterized, leading to only a small part of ginsenosides being obtained from RRPG. For example, only eight ginsenosides were isolated from 75% ethanol extract of RRPG, whereas 28 ginsenosides were obtained from 70% ethanol extract of RRPG. Thus far, only about 53 ginsenosides were obtained from RRPG. The other approach is identifying ginsenosides based on liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Especially with the help of high-resolution mass spectrometry, we can obtain the accurate molecular weights of ginsenosides as well as their molecular formulas, which is of great significance for their accurate characterization, and their structures are deduced according to the obtained tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation ions. Moreover, ginsenosides with low contents or minor amounts can be characterized so long as we obtain their fragmentation information. This approach can help us to characterize much more ginsenosides in RRPG. For example, 95 ginsenosides were identified from dried fresh ginseng whereas 131 ginsenosides were tentatively assigned in RRPG using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode-array detector and quadrupole/time of flight tandem mass spectrometry. However, the identified ginsenosides through the above-mentioned two approaches were only a small part but not all in RRPG up to date. The main reason is that ginsenosides in RRPG own similar chemical structures and polarity leading to their poor separation in reversed-phase chromatographic column, even if in the optimized chromatographic conditions, it is difficult to achieve complete separation for many peaks and even some peaks are covered by others with high abundances. Moreover, during acquisition of their fragmentation ions, the auto-MS/MS mode is usually adopted, where precursor ions are selected according to their intensities, resulting in only compounds with high intensities having the chance to be characterized, whereas constituents with lower or much lower abundances miss being characterized because their precursor ions are not selected so their MS/MS spectra cannot be obtained. Thus, it can be seen that obtaining MS/MS spectra of much more ginsenosides during MS/MS acquisition is a crucial problem for the comprehensive identification of ginsenosides in RRPG. However, relatively few studies specially address the issues of improving acquisition of MS/MS spectra of much more ginsenosides in order to comprehensively characterize them. To solve this problem, molecular features of ginsenosides orienting precursor ions selection and targeted MS/MS analysis strategy was proposed in our study, and the precursor ions were selected according to the molecular features of ginsenosides irrespective of their peak abundances (as opposed to automatically fragmenting the most abundant signals). As a result, a total of 620 ginsenosides were successfully characterized in RRPG using this strategy.","RRPG was supplied by the Scientific Research Institute of Beijing Tongrentang Co., Ltd. Total 35 reference standards, including ginsenoside Re5 (R20), Re3 (R28), Re4 (R34), Re1 (R46), Re2 (R54), Rg1 (R73), Re (R74), Rf (R200), Ra2 (R248), Ra3 (R257), Rb1 (R259), Ra1 (R289), Ro (R301), Rb2 (R324), Rb3 (R335), Rs2 (R401), Rd (R406), Ro methyl ester (R493), Rg6 (R556), F4 (R566), 20-gluco-ginsenoside Rf (R40), notoginsenoside R1 (R50), R4 (R201), R2 (R216), quinquenoside R1 (R358), ginsenjilinol (R70), 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg2 (R261), 20(S)-ginsenoside Rh1 (R263), 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg2 (R281), ginsenoside Rc (R285), 20(R)-ginsenoside Rh1 (R286), 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 (R593), 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg3 (R599), 20(S)-ginsenoside-Rh2 (R619) and 20(R)-ginsenoside-Rh2 (R620), were either purchased from the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing, China) as well as Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) or gifts from the State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Department of Natural Medicines, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University. The purity of all the reference standards were >98%. LC-MS-grade acetonitrile as well as methanol was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), LC-MS grade formic acid was purchased from Fisher-Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ, USA), and distilled water was obtained from Watsons.RRPG was pulverized into powder (the dimension of the obtained powder just like flour). The powder of RRPG (1.0 g) was extracted ultrasonically for 30 min with 10 mL 70% methanol at 25 °C. The extracted solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon filter membrane before analysis. The 35 reference standards were used only for confirmation of the accuracy of the characterization rather than quantifications. Each of the reference standards (1.0 mg) was separately dissolved in 1 mL 70% methanol to obtain the stock solution (1.0 mg/mL) of each reference standard. 10–20 μL of each stock solution was taken to mix and the mixture stock solution was obtained. Then, they were stored at 4 °C until analysis.The separation of the multiple components were performed using a Vanquish™ Flex UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), equipped with a binary pump and a thermostatted column compartment. Desirable chromatographic separation of the extract of RRPG was obtained on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC® BEH C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) coupled with a ACQUITY UPLC® BEH C18 VanGuardTM Pre-Column (2.1 × 5 mm, 1.7 μm) by using of the mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid/water, v/v) and mobile phase B (acetonitrile) by the following gradient elution program: 0–7 min, 2%–20% B; 7–10 min, 20%–25% B; 10–20 min, 25%–40% B; 20–25 min, 40%–65% B; 25–30min, 65%B–95% B. The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min and the temperature was set at 35 °C. The injection volume was 2 μL.High-accuracy mass spectrometric data were recorded on Orbitrap Exploris 240 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) with Heated ESI source. The instrument was operated in negative-ion mode. The optimized MS parameters were described as follows: ion spray voltage: 2500 V, sheath gas: 5.08 L/min, aux gas: 9.37 L/min, ion transfer tube temperature: 320 °C, vaporizer temperature: 350 °C, scan range (m/z): 150–2000 and collision-energy voltage: 35 V. The full scan was operated at a mass resolution of 60,000 whereas the MS2 scan was operated at a mass resolution of 15,000. Internal calibration source Thermo Scientific EASY-ICTM was adopted to calibrate the entire mass range.Data acquisition was performed on Thermo Xcalibur software (version 4.5) whereas data processing and data mining were performed on Free StyleTM 1.8 SP1 software and Compound DiscovererTM software (Thermo ScientificTM, version 3.2.0.421). Negative-ion mode was adopted to perform data acquisition due to ginsenosides exhibited high [M – H]– and/or [M – H + HAc]– ion responses in a full scan in this mode. The extracted solution of RRPG was first analyzed in a full scan mode so as to minimize the losses of signals and then targeted MS/MS analysis was followed after constructing the precursor ion lists.","The data mining workflow mainly involved four steps (shown in Figure 1):The ginsenosides isolated from RRPG were used to analyze their molecular features, and in this step, the following tasks involved: (1) Consulting the literatures: the isolated ginsenosides reported in a lot of the literature were consulted and their names, structures and molecular formulas were recorded. (2) Processing the recorded data: the accurate mass of the [M – H]− ion for each compound was calculated by ChemDraw software (version 14.0) based on the corresponding molecular formula, and the calculated value was saved with four decimal places. (3) Summarizing the molecular features of ginsenosides: from the recorded ginsenosides, we found that the molecular weights of ginsenosides were all above 600, indicating compounds with molecular weights below 600 probably were non-ginsenosides. The element compositions of ginsenosides were C, H, O, containing no nitrogen atom, leading to their [M – H]− ions were with odd normal masses. Thus, the ions with even normal masses were probably non-ginsenosides. Furthermore, the first number after the decimal point of their [M – H]− ions was between four and seven suggesting that of a compound out of this range was non-ginsenoside. The name, structure, molecular formula, molecular weight and accurate value of [M – H]− ion of each isolated ginsenoside were detailed in Table S1, ESI +.Compounds in RRPG were extracted by Compound Discoverer software (Thermo Scientific, version 3.2.0.421) through the designed workflow mainly involved “input files→select spectra→detect compounds→group compounds”. In the step of “input files”, the full scan data of the extract solution of RRPG was selected to be processed, whereas in the step of “select spectra”, the spectra properties such as the entire retention time (0–30 min) and negative-ion mode were selected for further processing. All compounds in the raw data were extracted using the component elucidator algorithm by setting a series of parameters such as mass tolerance: 5 ppm, signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold: 3, minimum peak intensity: 100,000, extracted ions: [M – H]− and [M – H + HAc]−, minimum element composition: CHO, maximum element composition: C90H190O90 and so on in the “detect compounds” step. The same ingredient extracted in different addition ways was grouped by its molecular weight as well as retention time across all files in the “group compounds” step. Running this designed extracting workflow, 27,000 compounds were extracted and presented by mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), retention time, and peak area, and all this information was exported out as an excel file. The obtained m/z and retention time of compounds were absolutely essential for constructing a precursor ion list.All of the extracted ions in the exported excel file were sorted by molecular weights from the smallest to the largest, and then they were filtered manually according to the molecular features of ginsenosides. The ions with molecular weights below 600, an even normal mass and the first number after the decimal point of ion not between four and seven were regarded as non-ginsenosides and filtered out. Finally, 7650 ions, which included ginsenosides, were retained to construct the precursor ion lists. However, in order to obtain high quality MS/MS spectra, the retained ions were averagely assigned in 15 precursor ion lists for segmented acquisition. Except for m/z and retention time (Rt), the retention time window (△Rt) was another essential parameter that was set as 0.5 min in a successful constructed list.With these 15 precursor ion lists in hand, we started to analyze the extract solution of RRPG in a precursor ion-directed LC-MS/MS method and each precursor ion list was performed targeted MS/MS analysis. The ginsenosides were identified according to the obtained MS/MS spectra.In our experiment, a total of 620 ginsenosides (shown in Table S2, ESI +) irrespective of their abundance were characterized in RRPG with the proposed analysis strategy including 309 protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides, 258 protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides as well as 53 oleanane-type ginsenosides, and all of their fragmentation ions were detailed in Table S2, ESI +. It was worth noting that, except for the known aglycones m/z 459, 475 and 455, the other twelve aglycones, including aglycones m/z 509, 507, 493, 491, 489, 487, 477, 473, 461, 457, 443 and 441 (shown in Figure 2), were first reported in our experiment and they were probably the derivatives of the protopanaxatriol and protopanaxadiol.Generally, the compounds in the same chemical clusters in a herbal own similar chemical structures, according to which the derivatives of the protopanaxatriol and protopanaxadiol could be deduced. The aglycone m/z 491 is 16 Da more than m/z 475 (the aglycone of protopanaxatriol) meaning it is oxidated-protopanaxatriol and its structure is probably the same as that of ginsenoside Re5 or ginsenjilinol (shown in Figure S1, ESI +), a known ginsenoside isolated from RRPG. However, the aglycone m/z 443 is 16 Da less than m/z 459 (the aglycone of protopanaxadiol), suggesting that it is deoxidated-protopanaxadiol and its structure is probably the same as that of vinaginsenoside R3 (shown in Figure S1, ESI +), a known compound isolated from the leaves of panax ginseng. The aglycone m/z 493 is 18 Da more than m/z 475, whereas m/z 457 is 18 Da less than m/z 475, indicating that the aglycone m/z 493 is double bond hydrated-protopanaxatriol with its structure probably the same as that of ginsenoside Rf2 (shown in Figure S1, ESI +), a known compound isolated from red panax ginseng, and the aglycone m/z 457 is dehydrated-protopanaxatriol with its structure probably the same as that of ginsenoside F4 (shown in Figure S1, ESI +), a known compound isolated from red panax ginseng, or ginsenoside Rg6 (shown in Figure S1, ESI +), a known compound isolated from the leaves of panax ginseng. In addition, the inference of the relation between the aglycone m/z 493 and m/z 475 was confirmed by ginsenosides R75, R77, R90, R93 and R95, in whose MS/MS spectra the fragmentation ion m/z 475 was obtained from m/z 493 by losing a molecule of H2O. It is worth noting that, in terms of molecular weight, the aglycone m/z 457 is 2 Da less than m/z 459 probably signifying it is dehydrogenation of the protopanaxadiol. Nevertheless, we did not find any ginsenoside with the aglycone of dehydrogenated-protopanaxadiol was isolated from the roots, rhizomes or leaves of panax ginseng, meaning the aglycone m/z 457 is probably irrelevant to m/z 459. The aglycone m/z 441 is 18 Da less than m/z 459, indicating thtat it is dehydrated-protopanaxadiol and its structure is probably the same as that of ginsenoside Rk1 or ginsenoside Rg5 (shown in Figure S1, ESI +), a known compound isolated from red panax ginseng. The aglycone m/z 489 is 14 Da more than m/z 475, suggesting that it is methyl etherified-protopanaxatriol with a structure probably the same as that of ginsenoside Rh5 (shown in Figure S1, ESI +), a known compound isolated from the stem and leaves as well as the fruit of panax ginseng. The aglycone m/z 473 is 2 Da less than m/z 475, meaning that it is dehydrogenated-protopanaxatriol with a structure probably the same as that of ginsenoside Rh7 or ginsenoside Rh8 (shown in Figure S1, ESI +), a known compound isolated from the leaves of panax ginseng.From the deduced aglycones mentioned above, we found that they were generally formed from protopanaxatriol or protopanaxadiol by dehydrogenation, double bond hydration, dehydration, methyl etherification, oxidation and deoxidation, based on which we deduced the aglycone m/z 461 was dihydrogenated-protopanaxadiol, the aglycone m/z 477 was dihydrogenated-protopanaxatriol, the aglycone m/z 509 was oxidated + hydrated-protopanaxatriol, the aglycone m/z 487 was methyl etherified + dehydrogenated-protopanaxatriol and the aglycone m/z 507 was dioxidated-protopanaxatriol.The diagnostic ions, lost sugar moieties and substituents information played an extremely important role in ginsenosides identification. It is well known for us that there are three types of ginsenosides in RRPG, including protopanaxadiol, protopanaxatriol and oleanane, which yield the diagnostic ions at m/z 459, 475 and 455, respectively, in their MS/MS spectra through eliminating a series of sugar moieties. These diagnostic ions were used to deduce the types of ginsenosides. The isolated compounds (shown in Table S1, ESI +) display the main sugar moieties in the structures of ginsenosides including glucuronic acid [Glu A (176 Da)], glucose [Glc (162 Da)], rhamnose [Rha (146 Da)], arabinose [Ara (132 Da)] as well as xylose [Xyl (132 Da)], and moreover, usually one Glu A, one or multiple Glc, one Rha, one Ara and/or one Xyl occurred on the aglycones of the ginsenosides. The non-sugar substituents in the structures mainly involved Acetyl (Ac, 42 Da), Malonyl (86 Da) and (E)-but-2-enoyl (68 Da), which usually do not replace other sugar moiety, but on Glc, and they are easily eliminated in the MS/MS analysis, supplying important information for ginsenosides identification.According to the diagnostic ions, lost sugar moieties and substituents information, reference standards information, the elution order information in reversed-phase column as well as the polar size of the compound and so on, all of the ginsenosides in RRPG were successfully characterized. In addition, it is generally believed that a compound with high abundance in a full scan usually stands for a relative high amount in a herbal, which is relatively easier to be isolated than the compound with much lower abundance or amount, according to which the isolated known compounds and their isomers can be easily identified. The total ion chromatograms of the reference standards and extract solution of RRPG were shown in Figure S2.In our study, a total of 293 ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 459 were successfully identified. Except for 49 glycosylation of protopanaxadiol, which were regarded as potentially new ginsenosides, the remaining compounds were all correlated with the known ginsenosides including 110 known ginsenosides as well as their isomers, 44 acetylation, 68 malonylation, 14 (E)-but-2-enoylation and 8 acetylation + malonylation of known ginsenosides.For example, eight compounds R575, R585, R589, R594, R601, R604, R606 and R608 eluted at 23.92 min–25.77 min showed their precursor ions at m/z 825.4999–825.5013 (shown in Figure 3A) with mass deviations of −0.12–1.59 ppm, suggesting that their molecular formula was C44H74O14. By performing their targeted MS/MS analysis, they all exhibited the same fragmentation ions and pathway. For instance, R608, in its MS/MS spectra, the diagnostic ion at m/z 459.3835 suggested it was protopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside and the mass difference between m/z 825.5009 and m/z 783.4903 was 42 Da indicating that acetyl was eliminated from the precursor ion. The fragmentation ions observed at m/z 621.4368 and 459.3835 indicating Glc and Glc were successively lost from m/z 783.4903 (shown in Figure 3B), which were the same as those of ginsenoside Rg3 (shown in Figure S3); therefore, R608 and the remaining seven compounds (R575, R585, R589, R594, R601, R604, and R606) were tentatively assigned as acetyl-ginsenoside Rg3. Their extraction ion chromatograms were shown in Figure 3C, and there was a big difference in their abundances. Three compounds R299, R317 and R439 also exhibited their precursor ions at m/z 825.4988–825.5000 with mass deviations of −1.45–0.00 ppm and owned the same fragmentation ions; however, their diagnostic ion and fragmentation pathway were different from the above eight ginsenosides, such as R439 (shown in Figure 3D). In its MS/MS spectra, the diagnostic ion at m/z 475.3794 indicating it was a protopanaxatriol-type ginsenoside and an acetyl group was eliminated due to there was a mass difference 42 Da between the precursor ion m/z 825.5000 and the ion m/z 783.4904. The ions at m/z 637.4363 and 475.3794 suggesting Rha and Glc were successively eliminated from the ion m/z 783.4904, which were the same as those of ginsenoside Rg2 (shown in Figure S4), therefore, R439 and R299, R317 were tentatively characterized as acetyl-ginsenoside Rg2. After eliminating malonyl (86 Da) from the precursor ion m/z 1193.5947, the remaining fragmentation ions of the fifteen compounds R205, R223, R279, R292, R320, R355, R373, R412, R432, R440, R448, R479, R485, R529 and R546 were observed at m/z 1107.5950, 945.5453, 783.4878, 621.4369 as well as 459.3831, which were the same as those of ginsenoside Rb1. R279 was deduced as a known constituent malonyl-ginsenoside Rb1 whereas the others were assigned as its isomers due to the relative abundance of R279 was much higher than the others. After eliminating (E)-but-2-enoyl (68 Da) from the precursor ion m/z 1013.5687, the remaining fragmentation ions of the four compounds R528, R558, R567 and R586 were detected at m/z 945.5403, 783.4888, 621.4343 as well as 459.3857, which were the same as those of ginsenoside Rd (shown in Figure S5), therefore, the four compounds were tentatively characterized as (E)-but-2-enoyl ginsenoside Rd. Thus it can be seen, the acetylation, malonylation, and (E)-but-2-enoylation of the known ginsenosides will first eliminate acetyl, malonyl and (E)-but-2-enoyl in their MS/MS spectra and the remaining fragmentation ions are the same as those of their corresponding ginsenosides, which can be used to deduce other acetyl-, malonyl-, and (E)-but-2-enoyl-ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 459.Besides, some potential new ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 459 were also characterized. For instance, R219 (shown in Figure 3E), its precursor ion was extracted at m/z 1269.6471 with a mass deviation of –0.63 ppm indicating its molecular formula was C60H102O28. The diagnostic ion was at m/z 459.3835, indicating that it was a protopanaxatriol-type ginsenoside. The fragmentation ions at m/z 1107.5922, 945.5416, 783.4902, 621.4380 and 459.3835 suggested Glc, Glc, Glc, Glc and Glc were successively eliminated from the precursor ion, respectively. However, the current known compounds were not well matched with R219, therefore, R219 was tentatively characterized as a potential new ginsenoside protopanaxadiol + 5Glc. For R288, the mass difference between the precursor ion m/z 1355.6470 and its fragmentation ion m/z 1269.5906 was 86 Da indicated that malonyl was eliminated from the precursor ion. The remaining fragmentation ions (shown in Figure 3F) were the same as those of R219, thus R288 was probably malonylation of R219. However, according to the known malonylation of ginsenosides, malonyl always occurs on Glc, thus R288 was tentatively characterized as protopanaxadiol + 4Glc + malonyl Glc. Similarly, other 47 potential new ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 459 were assigned.The aglycones of R120, R138 and R155 were m/z 461, which was deemed as dihydrogenated-protopanaxadiol due to it being 2 Da more than m/z 459. For example, R138 (shown in Figure 4A), its precursor ion, was extracted at m/z 1121.5742 with a mass deviation of –0.18 ppm, indicating that its molecular was C54H90O24. The mass difference between the precursor ion and its fragmentation ion m/z 1079.5619 was 42 Da suggested that acetyl was lost in MS/MS spectra. The ions observed at m/z 947.5371, 785.4726, 623.4160 and 461.3647 were formed by successive losses of Xyl/Ara, Glc, Glc and Glc from the ion m/z 1079.5619. Generally, the acetylation always occurs on Glc from the known acetyl-ginsenosides, thus R138 was deduced as dihydrogenated-protopanaxadiol + Xyl/Ara + 2Glc + acetyl Glc.Two compounds, R381 and R169, were elucidated as ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 443. For example, the precursor ion of R169 was extracted at m/z 1253.6544 and generated the aglycone at m/z 443.3906 by successive losses of Glc, Glc, Glc, Glc, Glc in its MS/MS spectra (shown in Figure 4B). Thus, R169 was deduced as an unknown ginsenoside deoxidated-protopanaxadiol + 5Glc. The aglycone of R381, m/z 443.3901, was formed by successive losses of Glc, Glc and Glc from the precursor ion m/z 929.5488. R381 was tentatively deduced as a known compound vinaginsenoside R3.A total of five compounds, including R226, R443, R446, R616 and R618, were characterized as ginsenoisdes with aglycone m/z 441. Three compounds, R226, R443, and R446, owned not only the same precursor ions but also the same fragmentation ions. Taking R446 as an example, R446 was extracted at m/z 807.4531 with mass deviations of 0.00 ppm indicating its molecular formula was C43H68O14. In its MS/MS spectra (shown in Figure 4C), the mass difference between the fragmentation ion m/z 765.4421 and the precursor ion m/z 807.4531 was 42 Da indicating acetyl was eliminated. The ion at m/z 603.3807 and 441.3345 were formed by successive losses of Glc and Glc from the ion m/z 765.4421, respectively, indicating there were 2Glc in its structure. Due to acetyl always occurs on Glc, R446 were elucidated as dehydrated-protopanaxadiol + acetyl Glc + Glc. The precursor ions of R616 (eluted at 26.72 min) and R618 (eluted at 26.90 min) were separately extracted at m/z 765.4795 and 765.4798. By performing their targeted MS/MS analysis, we found that they owned the same fragmentation ion m/z 603.4263 and aglycone m/z 441.3346, which were formed by successively eliminating Glc and Glc from the precursor ion, respectively. R616 and R618 were tentatively assigned as ginsenoside Rk1 and ginsenoside Rg5, respectively. As ginsenoside Rk1 was eluted before ginsenoside Rg5 on a reverse-phase column, R616 was deduced as ginsenoside Rk1, whereas R618 was characterized as ginsenoside Rg5.In our experiment, a total of 145 ginsenosides were identified with aglycone m/z 475, including 33 glycosylation of protopanaxatriol, 69 known ginsenosides, as well as their isomers, 20 acetylation, 19 malonylation, 2 (E)-but-2-enoylation and 2 acetylation + malonylation of known ginsenosides. Except for that, six ginsenosides (R66 and its isomers R72, R103, R112, R124 and R152) belong to protopanaxadiol-type also exhibited their aglycones at m/z 475.For instance, the precursor ions of eight compounds R106, R114, R118, R127, R141, R151, R171 and R175 were extracted at m/z 987.5519–987.5536 (shown in Figure 5A) with mass deviations of −1.01–0.71 ppm indicating their molecular formula was C50H84O19. In their MS/MS spectra, they all showed the same fragmentation ions, taking R127 as an example. We deduced an acetyl was eliminated from the precursor ion due to the ion m/z 945.5443 was observed, and then Glc, Rha and Glc were successively eliminated because a series of ions m/z 783.4902, 637.4315 and 475.3795 were obtained (shown in Figure 5B). By observing carefully, after loss of acetyl, the fragmentation ions and pathway were the same as those of ginsenoside Re (shown in Figure S6), thus, R127 and the other seven compounds R106, R114, R118, R141, R151, R171, R175 were deduced as acetyl-ginsenoside Re. Their extraction ion chromatograms were shown in Figure 5C and we found there was a big difference in their abundances. It is worth noting that, although the twelve compounds R364, R382, R389, R429, R460, R476, R499, R506, R535, R545, R613 and R617 also exhibited the precursor ion at m/z 987.5524–987.5538 (shown in Figure 5A), their fragmentation ions were different from those of acetyl-ginsenoside Re. And the twelve compounds owned the same fragmentation ions, such as R535 (shown in Figure 5D). After eliminating the acetyl group from the precursor ion m/z 987.5537, the fragmentation ion m/z 945.5444 was obtained, and it subsequently generated the ions m/z 783.4902, 621.4377 and 459.3849, which were the same as those of ginsenoside Rd (shown in Figure S5). Based on the above information, R535 and the other eleven compounds were characterized as acetyl-ginsenoside Rd. Thus, it can be seen that the diagnostic ions played an extremely important role in the characterization of the ginsenosides in RRPG.In the same way, other known ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 475 as well as their isomers, acetylations, malonylations, (E)-but-2-enoylations were tentatively assigned and the fragmentation pathways were used to deduce the 33 unknown ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 475, namely glycosylation of protopanaxatriol, such as R202. The mass difference between the precursor ion m/z 1179.5806 and its fragmentation ion m/z 1093.5795 was 86 Da, suggested that malonyl group was eliminated from the precursor ion in its MS/MS spectra. The ions at m/z 961.5365, 799.4838, 637.4296, 475.3789 suggested Ara/Xyl, Glc, Glc and Glc were successively eliminated from the ion m/z 1093.5795, respectively (shown in Figure 5E). The diagnostic ion m/z 475.3789 indicated that R202 was protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides.However, current known ginsenosides were not well matched with it, thus R202 was deemed as a new ginsenoside protopanaxatriol + Ara/Xyl + 2Glc + Malonyl Glc. The precursor ion of R224 was extracted at m/z 859.4685 with a mass deviation of –0.70 ppm and in its MS/MS spectra, the mass difference between the ion m/z 813.4393 and the precursor ion was 46 Da suggesting m/z 859.4685 was [M – H + HAc]– ion whereas m/z 813.4393 was [M – H]– ion. The fragmentation ions m/z 637.4297, 475.3783 suggested Glu A and Glc were successively eliminated from [M – H]– ion, respectively (shown in Figure 5F). R224 was characterized as a new ginsenoside protopanaxatriol + Glu A + Glc. In the same way, the other 31 potential new ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 475 were tentatively characterized.The aglycones of R1, R2 and R16 were m/z 509, which was 34 Da more than m/z 475, suggesting it was oxidated + hydrated-protopanaxatriol. R1 showed its [M–H]– ion at m/z 979.5486 (mass deviation of 0.82 ppm) while R2 exhibited its [M – H + HAc]– ion at m/z 1025.5530 (mass deviation of –0.20 ppm), which indicated that the molecular formula of R1 and R2 was C48H84O20. In their MS/MS spectra, they owned the same fragmentation ions, such as R1 (shown in Figure 6A). The ions at m/z 817.4918, 671.4409 and 509.3840 were formed by successive losses of sugar moieties Glc, Rha and Glc from the precursor ion, respectively. In addition, a series of dehydrated ions were observed at m/z 799.4863, 653.4276, 635.4174 and 491.3755. Thus, R1 and R2 were deduced as oxidated + hydrated-protopanaxatriol + 2Glc + Rha. After eliminating Glc, the remaining fragmentation ions of R1 or R2 were the same as those of R16, which meant that the structure of R16 was one Glc less than that of R1 or R2. Based on the above information, R16 was deemed as oxidated + hydrated protopanaxatriol + Glc + Rha.The aglycone of R12 was observed at m/z 507.3710, which was deemed as dioxidated-protopanaxatriol due to it being 32 Da more than m/z 475. In its MS/MS spectra, the mass difference between the precursor ion m/z 877.4809 and the fragmentation ion m/z 831.4691 was 46 Da implying m/z 877.4809 was [M – H + HAc]– ion whereas m/z 831.4691 was [M – H]– ion. There were 2Glc in its structure because the aglycone was formed by losses of 2Glc from [M – H]– ion (shown in Figure 6B), thus R12 was elucidated as dioxidated-protopanaxatriol + 2Glc.A total of 20 compounds were assigned as ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 493. For example, the [M – H]– ions of R90 was extracted at m/z 1021.5587. In its MS/MS spectra, the fragmentation ions at m/z 979.5484, 817.4941, 655.4421, and 493.3891 were formed by successive losses of Ac, Glc, Glc, and Glc from the precursor ion, respectively (shown in Figure 6C). Due to the aglycone of R90 being double bond hydrated-protopanaxatriol, there were much more hydroxyl groups in its structure leading to much more dehydrated ions were obtained. Finally, R90 was characterized as double bond hydrated-protopanaxatriol + 2Glc + acetyl Glc. The precursor ions ([M – H + HAc]–) of R36 and R47 were extracted at m/z 847.5063 and 847.5060, respectively, with mass deviations of no more than 0.94 ppm. By performing their targeted MS/MS analysis, they all generated the same fragmentation ions at m/z 801.5004, 655.4425 and 493.3891 by successive losses of HAc, Rha and Glc from the precursor ion, respectively. R36 was deduced as a known compound ginsenoside Rf2 whereas R47 was elucidated as its isomer due to the relative abundance of R36 being much higher than that of R47. In the same way, other ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 493 were elucidated.In our study, a total of 36 compounds were identified as ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 491. Four compounds, R3, R8, R9 and R11, showed their [M – H + HAc]– precursor ions at m/z 861.4847–861.4856 with mass deviations of −0.12–0.93 ppm, whereas the fourteen compounds R15, R17, R18, R20, R24, R41, R57, R70, R99, R119, R139, R153, R170 and R193 exhibited their [M – H]– precursor ions at m/z 815.4790–815.4804 with mass deviations of −0.37–1.35 ppm. In their MS/MS spectra, all the eighteen compounds shared the same fragmentation ions at m/z 653.4243 and 491.3737 formed by eliminating Glc and Glc from their [M – H]– ion, respectively. However, R20 was assigned as ginsenoside Re5 whereas R70 was deemed as ginsenjilinol by comparison with the reference standards and subsequently the other sixteen compounds were characterized as their isomers. From Figure S1, ESI +, we found that the aglycones of ginsenoside Re5 and ginsenjilinol were with different structures due to their cis-trans of double bond in C24 and C25 being different, but all were oxidated-protopanaxatriol. Thus, we consider that other identified ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 491 probably own the same aglycone structure as either ginsenoside Re5 or ginsenjilinol. For instance, R85 (shown in Figure 6D) was deduced as oxidated-protopanaxatriol + acetyl Glc + Rha because its aglycone was obtained at m/z 491.3756 and was formed by successive losses of Ac, Rha and Glc from the precursor ion m/z 841.4953. Similarly, the other 17 compounds with aglycone m/z 491were tentatively characterized.Six compounds, R10, R13, R31, R51, R62 and R126, were deduced as ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 489. For example, the [M – H + HAc]– precursor ion of R126 was extracted at m/z 8159.4701. In its MS/MS spectra (shown in Figure 6E), the fragmentation ions at m/z 651.4153 and 489.3582 were formed by successive losses of Glc and Glc from [M – H]– ion, respectively. Thus, R126 was elucidated as methyl etherified-protopanaxatriol + 2Glc.The aglycone of R62 was at m/z 487, which was deemed as methyl etherified + dehydrogenated-protopanaxatriol because it was 12 Da more than m/z 475. As shown in Figure 6F, the aglycone m/z 487.3440 was formed by successive losses of Glc and Glu A from the precursor ion m/z 987.4805. Thus, R62 was concluded as methyl etherified + dehydrogenated-protopanaxatriol + 2Glc + Glu A.The aglycones of the three compounds, R91, R148 and R156, were m/z 477, which was deemed as dihydrogenated-protopanaxatriol due to it being 2 Da more than m/z 475. For R91 (shown in Figure 6G), its [M – H + HAc]− ion was extracted at m/z 1009.5579 which was confirmed by the [M – H]– ion observed at m/z 963.5515 in its MS/MS spectra because their mass difference was 46 Da. The aglycone at m/z 477.3950 was formed by successive losses of Glc, Glc and Glc from [M – H]– ion, suggesting that there was 3Glc in its structure. Thus, R91 was deduced as dihydrogenated-protopanaxatriol + 3Glc. In the same way, other ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 477 were characterized.A total of 20 compounds, including R39, R67, R80, R102, R129, R133, R159, R161, R179, R183, R186, R187, R194, R199, R241, R246, R333, R480, R452 and R532, were tentatively deduced as ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 473. R452 and R532 separately eluted at 21.39 min and 22.79 min were deduced as two known compounds ginsenoside Rh7 and ginsenoside Rh8 due to their aglycones at m/z 473.3669 being formed by a loss of Glc from their [M – H]– ions. However, according to their structures, ginsenoside Rh7 is with higher polarity than ginsenoside Rh8 leading to it is eluted firstly on a reverse-phase column. Thus, R452 was assigned as ginsenoside Rh7, whereas R532 was deduced as ginsenoside Rh8. Although the aglycones of ginsenoside Rh7 and ginsenoside Rh8 were with different structures due to their different dehydrogenated positions, actually they were dehydrogenated-protopanaxatriol. R129 was deduced as dehydrogenated-protopanaxatriol + 3Glc because its aglycone m/z 473.3635 was formed by eliminating 3Glc from the precursor ion m/z 959.5223 (shown in Figure 6H). Similarly, other ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 473 were tentatively characterized.In our experiment, 23 compounds, including R160, R231, R238, R262, R270, R280, R298, R340, R360, R363, R380, R388, R392, R418, R434, R450, R469, R470, R556, R566, R591, R602 and R610, were deduced as ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 457. R556 and R566 exhibited the same aglycone at m/z 457.3707 which was formed by successive losses of Rha and Glc from the precursor ion m/z 765.4795. R556 was assigned as ginsenoside Rg6 whereas R566 was deemed as ginsenoside F4, and they were confirmed by comparison with the reference standards. Their aglycones were with different structures, but all were dehydrated-protopanaxatriol. R160 was characterized as dehydrated-protopanaxatriol + 4Glc due to the alycone m/z 457.3698 being formed by losses of 4Glc from the precursor ion m/z 1105.5779 (shown in Figure 6I). In the same way, other ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 457 were tentatively assigned.A total of 53 oleanane-type of ginsenosides with aglycone m/z 455 were identified in this study, including 33 known ginsenosides, as well as their isomers, seven acetylations, four malonylations, four (E)-but-2-enoylations, one acetylation + malonylation and four glycosylation of oleanolic aglycone.For example, the precursor ions of the eight compounds, R240, R253, R265, R301, R315, R385, R438 and R504, were extracted at m/z 955.4899–955.4916 (shown in Figure 7A) with mass deviations of −0.42–1.36 ppm, indicating that their molecular formula was C48H76O19. By performing their targeted MS/MS analysis, they all exhibited the same fragmentation ions, such as R438 (shown in Figure 7B), at m/z 793.4358, 731.4333 and 569.3846 formed by successive losses of Glc, [CO2 + H2O] and Glc from the precursor ion m/z 955.4912, respectively. The aglycone at m/z 455.3546 was formed by loss of [2Glc + Glu A] from m/z 955.4912. R301 was assigned as ginsenoside Ro and confirmed by the reference standard, R438 and the other six compounds R240, R253, R265, R315, R385 and R504 were tentatively deemed as ginsenoside Ro isomers. Their extraction ion chromatograms were shown in Figure 7C, from which we found the abundance of ginsenosides Ro was much higher than those of the other seven ginsenosides. Except for the ginsenosides identified correlating with the known compounds, four unknown ginsensides, which were deemed as glycosylation of oleanolic aglycone, were also characterized. For instance, R221 was deduced as oleanolic aglycone + 2Glc + Xyl/Ara + Glu A due to the aglycone m/z 455.3531 was formed by a loss of [2Glc + Xyl/Ara + Glu A] from the precursor ion m/z 1087.5337 (shown in Figure 7D) whereas R346 was deemed as oleanolic aglycone + Glc + Rha + Glu A because its aglycone m/z 455.3532 was formed by loss of [Glc + Rha + Glu A] from the precursor ion m/z 939.4953 (shown in Figure 7E).",,"While there are many ginsenosides in RRPG, the ginsenosides currently isolated from it are just in part, which leads to the limitation of the cognition of ginsenosides for people. In our study, a strategy based on molecular features of ginsenosids orienting precursor ions selection and targeted MS/MS analysis was proposed to comprehensively identify ginsenosides in RRPG. The identified 620 ginsenosides confirmed the current cognition that ginsenosides in RRPG mainly existed in the forms of the known three types of protopanaxadiol, protopanaxatriol and oleanane. Furthermore, except for the known aglycones m/z 475, 459 and 455, our study proved that there were many more types of aglycones existing in RRPG, such as m/z 461, 443 as well as 441 for protopanaxadiol-type and m/z 509, 507, 493, 491, 489, 487, 477, 473 as well as 457 for protopanaxatriol-type, and the aglycones of protopanaxatriol-type were much more various than those of protopanaxadiol-type. Nevertheless, the oleanane-type ginsenosides were only with the aglycone m/z 455. Our study will help people to improve the cognition and understanding of ginsenosides in RRPG.It is worth noting that malonyl-ginsenosides are acidic saponins with strong polarity and are extremely easily hydrolyzed in the conditions of acid, alkali, hot water as well as hot methanol or ethanol to form corresponding ginsenosides by the loss of malonyl. Therefore, in order to retain the prototype of malonyl-ginsenosides, the powders of RRPG was extracted with 70% methanol at 25 °C so as to try to avoid the destabilized factor and finally much more malonyl-ginsenosides were detected, such as 108 malonyl-ginsenosides as well as 24 acetylation + malonylation ginsenosides were successfully identified.In addition, the unknown ginsenosides identified as the isomers, acetylations, malonylations, (E)-but-2-enoylations, acetylation + malonylation of the known ginsenosides as well as glycosylation of protopanaxadiol, glycosylation of protopanaxatriol, glycosylation of oleanolic aglycone are probably potential new compounds. For example, ginsenjilinol (R70) with aglycone m/z 491 was previously isolated as a new ginsenoside from RRPG by our research group and owned some certain anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, our study will play a guiding and reference role for the isolation and characterization of these potential new ginsenosides in RRPG. Besides, panax ginseng, which is a traditional Chinese medicine with clinical value and a tonic with nourishing effect, is often combined with other medicines forming many prescriptions to cure multiple diseases. However, panax ginseng is mainly used in the form of powers and it is directly mixed with the extracts of other medicines in these prescriptions, which leads to ginsenosides in the prescriptions just come from the involved single herb panax ginseng. Therefore, our study will also provide a reference for ginsenosides identification for traditional Chinese formulas containing panax ginseng."
17,TA043019,10.3390/antibiotics11070913,Novel Formula of Antiprotozoal Mixtures.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming more common in both bacteria andpathogenic protozoa. Therefore, new solutions are being sought as alternatives tocurrently used agents. There are many new ideas and solutions, especiallycompounds of natural origin, including essential oils. In the present study, theantiprotozoal activity of a mixture of essential oils (eucalyptus, lavender,cedar and tea tree), organic acids (acetic acid, propionic acid and lactic acid)and metal ions (Cu, Zn, Mn) were tested. As a model, protozoans were selected:Euglena gracilis, Gregarina blattarum, Amoeba proteus, Paramecium caudatum,Pentatrichomonas hominis. The tested concentrations of mixtures were in the rangeof 0.001-1.5%. The analyses show unexpected, very strong protozoicidal activityof combinations, presenting the synergy of compounds via determination of LD(50)and LD(100) values. Obtained mixtures showed significantly higher activityagainst protozoans, compared to chloramphenicol and metronidazole. Most of theanalyzed samples show high antiprotozoal activity at very low concentration, inthe range of 0.001-0.009%. The most effective combinations for all analyzedprotozoans were the cedar essential oil and tea tree essential oil with a mixtureof acids and manganese or zinc ions. Innovative combinations of essential oils,organic acids and metal ions are characterized by very high antiprotozoalactivity at low doses, which, after further investigation, can be applicable forcontrol of protozoan pathogens.","Iwiński, Hubert, Łyczko, Jacek, Różański, Henryk, Szumny, Antoni",2022,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2,True,True,True,"Each year, more than 15 million people die worldwide due to infectious diseases caused by various pathogens including bacteria, protozoa, viruses or fungi. One of the main causes of death, besides bacterial and viral diseases, are diseases caused by protozoa such as Plasmodium spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma spp..The most deadly diseases caused by protozoa undoubtedly include malaria, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, sleeping sickness), Chagas disease, Visceral leishmaniasis (VL, kala azar), toxoplasmosis, Naegleriasis (PAM—primary amoebic meningoencephalitis), babesiosis or cryptosporidiosis. The most common signs of protozoan infection include diarrhea, fever, malaise or hepatosplenomegaly.Currently, there are three main methods of controlling protozoan parasites: prevention and containment of protozoan vectors, vaccination and antibiotic-based pharmacotherapy. Based on the example of malaria, we know that the primary and so far most effective weapon in the fight against parasitic protozoa is prevention and elimination of vectors, which are most often mosquitoes, ticks or bedbugs. To reduce the risk of infection, many international and national guidelines recommend the use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS) or both methods together. Moreover, control of vector abundance also contributes significantly to reduce the spread of pathogens. The most commonly used method of controlling protozoa is the use of pharmaceuticals. Most often, these are single active substances that show antimicrobial activity. These include nifurtimox, pentamidine, quinine sulfate, fexinidazoles, benznidazoles, artemisinin derivatives and chloroquine, among others. However, most of them have been marketed for completely different purposes and medical indications. Mixed therapies combining two or more pharmacological agents, for example, nifurtimox-eflornithine (NECT), artemether-lumefantrine or quinine sulfate with doxycycline, tetracycline or clindamycin are also commonly used to optimize effects.Mixed therapies are also a response to increasing resistance of microorganisms to available antibiotics. This is currently a significant problem that affects people all over the world. Its genesis is very complex and is influenced, among others, by high mobility and the possibility of movement all over the world, inadequate hygienic and sanitary conditions or the excessive use of antibiotics both in humans and animals. As mentioned above, reducing pathogenic protozoa, especially those showing resistance, is through combination therapy. However, without clinical trials using similar combinations, it is very difficult to estimate their cytotoxicity and interaction in the body.The lack of new and effective antibiotics causes the need for another alternative. This leads very often to developing an effective method to fight protozoa. The object of interest of researchers around the world are currently natural compounds extracted or obtained from plants. Compounds showing antimicrobial activity include phenolic compounds, terpenes, sulfur glycosides or alkaloids.Essential oils are characterized by a very high antimicrobial and antiprotozoal potential. They are volatile mixtures, most of which are scented, of various substances of mainly plant origin. They are obtained via steam distillation from various fragments of plant leaves, flowers, fruits, buds, bark, seeds and even roots. They are usually stored in glandulars. The growing interest in natural solutions, being an alternative to the currently used, generates new studies and reports in the literature. Papers or patents present that EOs are characterized by great antimicrobial potential. In vitro studies performed show very strong antiprotozoal activity of, e.g., tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia (Maiden & Betche) Cheel), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.), thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), catnip (Nepeta cataria L.), yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.), basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), Lippia sp., peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.). The current interest in natural alternatives to the available therapies is generating an increasing amount of scientific research. A growing number of studies are also investigating the antiprotozoal properties of individual components of essential oils, such as monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids as well as their alcohol, ester or ketone derivatives.Organic acids are commonly known compounds used in food, cosmetic, feed and pharmaceutical markets as acidifiers, stabilizers, acidity regulators or preservatives. The last feature has been used widely through the ages for food prevention. That property is mainly based on the lowering of the pH, which results in the inhibition of microbials. Organic acids show very good results in broilers and fish production, by their antibacterial and antiprotozoal properties.The combination of metals, e.g., iron, cobalt, nickel, gallium, copper, gold or silver with drugs are well known and very effective. Complex of Ru(II) chloroquine was one of the first tested antiprotozoal drugs combined with metal ions and showed a much better result than chloroquine itself. Other examples tested and evaluated for their antiprotozoal properties can be auranofin, triethylphosphine gold(I) chloride, cisplatin, 2-mercaptopyridine N-oxide complexes with Pt(II), Au(I) and Pd(II), or one of the most efficient for organometallic compounds, ferroquine. Moreover, not only do the combining synthetic drugs and metals have great potential. Natural compounds such as essential oils, alkaloids and phenols in combination with metal ions are also investigated by researchers.The mode of action of metal ions, mostly, is to impair the proper function of the cell membrane. They may be incorporated with the cell membrane, modulate ion channels, disrupt proton transfer or electrostatically interact with charges on the membrane surface. Metal ions can also affect various cell processes within cytoplasm such as inhibition of enzymes and proteins, catalyze the n of oxygen and hydroperoxide radicals and interrupt nutrient uptake.The aim of this study was to investigate antiprotozoal properties of an innovative mixture of essential oils (eucalyptus, lavender, cedar and tea tree), organic acids (acetic, propionic, lactic) and metal ions (Cu, Zn and Mn). Previous research and scientific papers showed antiprotozoal properties of all components, but there were no scientific data about the proposed combinations.","Five organisms representing the taxonomic groups to which the pathogenic protozoa belong were selected for in vitro studies of the antiprotozoal activity of the mixtures:Amoeba proteus—Chaos diffluens—a protozoan of the order Euamoebida, belonging to the phylum Amoebozoa, living in water.Paramecium caudatum—a paramecium representing aquatic ciliates.Gregarina blattarum—gregarines were isolated from cockroaches, representing the type Apicomplexa, living in the digestive tracts or body cavities of invertebrates.Euglena gracilis—a protozoan living in water, representing the flagellates—Mastigophora, family Euglenaceae.Pentatrichomonas hominis—a protozoan that lives in the human colon, representing the Trichomonadidae.The Amoeba, Paramecium and Euglena studied in this work were isolated from the freshwater river in Krosno (river Bado, 49°39’59.8’ N 21°46’28.1’ E, Krosno, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, Poland).Amoeba proteus was cultivated in the Prescott medium and was fed with ciliates, for example, Tetrahymena and Chilomonas. Paramecium was cultivated in hay infusion. Euglena was cultivated in solution according to Wu. Pentatrichomonas hominis was isolated from stool samples and kept in Pahm solution according to Chomicz et al. The gregarines were isolated from cockroaches and treated with the mixtures at different concentrations after being placed on a watch glass in Ringer’s solution. Each sample included ten individuals. The isolation of gregarine from cockroaches was carried out according to the method of isolation of gregarines from beetles proposed by J. Moraczewski.Amoeba, Paramecium and Euglena were observed microscopically on a watch glass with viscose wool fibers (to facilitate observation) in a drop of culture water, from which they originated. Different concentrations of the combinations were introduced into the test samples, establishing an LD50 dose (50% mortality) and an LD100 dose (100% mortality). For determining LD50, the Reed–Muench method was used. In all cases, four-fold replicates of the test were used along with a blank test. The lethal concentration of the substance LD50 and LD100 within 3 and 5 min was determined.Identification of individual protozoa was made on the basis of their descriptions and drawings after W. A. Dogiel and J. Hempel-Zawitkowska.The obtained mixtures of phytoncides with metals and single phytoncides were dissolved in an aqueous solution of polysorbate 80 (0.05%) before being applied to a watch glass. No biocidal effect of polysorbate 80 was observed at the above concentrations. Chloramphenicol and metronidazole were used as standard substances to control protozoa. Concentration of the antibiotics were 5 mg/mL and the dilutions were prepared from the stock to reach LD50 and LD100.Essential oils were ordered from two companies. Eucalyptus and tea tree were purchased from Food Base Kft. (Gödöllő, Hungary), cedar essential oil from Synthite Industries Pvt., Ltd. (Kolenchery, Kerala, India) and lavender essential oil from De Monchy Aromatics Ltd. (Poole, Dorset, UK)Organic acids (acetic acid 99%, propionic acid 99.5% and lactic acid 85%) and other chemical reagents purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) comply with FCC and FG standards. The purity and percentage composition, according to the supplier’s specification, was minimum ≥95%.Essential oils (100 mL) were added in the same amount to organic acids (100 mL) or mixture of acids (ratio 1:1:1) and 5 g of copper (II) carbonate hydroxide (2.87 g of ions Cu2+) or 5 g zinc carbonate (2.61 g of ions Zn2+) or 5 g manganese (II) chloride (2.18 g of ions Mn2+). The entire mixture was heated until the color changed. The mixture was then allowed to cool to obtain a clear solution (one, two or three phases). After this time, the mixture was filtered through a paper filter. The combination was diluted: 1.5% to 0.001%; after that, the protozoa were placed in each dilution.The profile of the essential oils investigated was assessed using the GC-MS technique according to the protocol. Identification of all volatile constituents was based on comparison of experimentally obtained compound’s mass spectra with mass spectra available in the NIST20 database. Additionally, the retention indices (RI) obtained experimentally, calculated using macro, were compared with the RI available in the NIST20 database and the data from the literature. Shimadzu software GCMS Postrun Analysis (Shimadzu Company, Kyoto, Japan) and ACD/Spectrus Processor (Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) were used to process the data. The quantification of identified constituents was performed by calculation based on the amount of added internal standard and expressed as a percentage of integrated peaks’ area. Analysis was performed using the Shimadzu 2020 apparatus (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA) equipped with a Zebron ZB-5 MSI (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The temperature of the GC oven was programmed from 50 °C to 250 °C at a rate of 3.0 °C and kept for 3 min. Scanning was performed from 35 to 550 m/z in electronic impact (EI) at 70 eV and ion source temperature 250 °C. Samples were injected at split ratio 1:10 and gas helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.The data, from LD50 and LD100 evaluation, were subjected to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Tukey’s test (p < 0.05) using the STATISTICA 13.3 software for Windows (StatSoft, Krakow, Poland).","In the study, antiprotozoal properties were analyzed for single components of the mixtures: 48 combinations (4 essential oils with 3 metals and 3 organic acids and their mixtures). All obtained combinations are presented in Table 1. Chloramphenicol and metronidazole were used as standard substances. The obtained results are presented in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8 and Table 9. They are characterized by variable efficiency depending on the combination used and the protozoan species. The combinations containing an essential oil, a single acid and one of the selected metals showed much stronger antiprotozoal properties than the single components, and in some cases, than the antibiotics used for comparison. Among these combinations, the combination of tea tree essential oil, with propionic acid and manganese (TPMn) showed the highest potential. TPMn showed LD50, at a very low amount—0.01%. That result is much better than the reference antibiotics—chloramphenicol and metronidazole. It was also observed that the strongest activity independently of the used oil was observed for propionic acid and manganese ions.The lowest antiprotozoal values against analyzed protozoa were obtained for innovative combinations of essential oil with the mixture of organic acids and selected metal. They showed an activity almost ten times stronger than that of analogous mixtures containing a single organic acid and an activity almost a hundred times stronger than that of single essential oils. Many of the proposed combinations showed activity against protozoa in the lowest tested concentration—0.001%. Most of the mixtures were very effective against Euglena gracilis. This protozoa was the most vulnerable form of all tested organisms. The concentration 0.001% was equal LD50 for 4 combinations, tea tree essential oil, mixture of acids and copper (TMCu); tea tree essential oil, mixture of acids and manganese (TMMn); cedar essential oil, mixture of acids and copper (CMCu); lavender essential oil, mixture of acids and manganese (LMMn). The highest concentration for the essential oil, mixture of acids and metal ions was obtained for the tea tree essential oil, mixture of acids and manganese (TMMn)—0.009%. Nevertheless, all the combinations with manganese ions showed the best results for all protozoans. However, it should be noted that the worst result for the combination of essential oil, mixture of acids and metal, is more than 10 times better than for the reference substance, which in this case is metronidazole. The values obtained for the remaining combinations were characterized by significantly lower effective doses than the reference substances, chloramphenicol or metronidazole. The mixtures with highest potential and lowest LD50 and LD100 values can be found in Table 10. Comparison between the most effective compositions, analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Tukey’s test, are presented in the Supplementary Materials.The chromatograms (presented in Supplementary Materials Figures S1–S4) show the chemical composition of the four essential oils used. Presented in Tables S1–S4 proves the typical mixtures for these essential oils’ composition. Predominated compounds for lavender EOs are linalyl acetate, linalool, 1-terpinen-4-ol and eucalyptol. In case of eucalyptus oil, 80.7% of the sum of the investigated compounds is an 1,8-cineol (eucalyptol) together with p-cymene 9.8%. Tea tree oil was rich in terpineols (mainly 1-terpinen-4-ol ~40%) with corresponding terpinenes (respectively γ–15.4% and α–9%). Finally, cedar oil was himachalene chemotype (β-isomer, 27.3% and α, with 9.1% content) together with sesquiterpenoic atlantone (isomer Z, 12.3% and trans-α 9.6%).Detailed composition of investigated EOs are presented in Tables S1–S4.","The results of the in vitro studies presented below confirm the antiprotozoal properties of blends which contained in their composition essential oils (eucalyptus, cedar, lavender or tea tree) with organic acids (acetic, propionic, lactic) and metal ions (Cu, Zn, Mn).The combination containing essential oils, organic acids and metal ions was a concept that occurred after several years of research on natural alternatives for antibiotics. Moreover, and what is very important, all of the used components are allowed to be used in food and feed. The idea corresponds strongly with the scientific results obtained by other researchers. Components used in this study were chosen by their antiprotozoal activity and different polarity.To the best of our knowledge, presented in this paper, combinations of EOs, acids and metal ions were tested for the first time. The object of investigations that have been conducted, are usually combinations of two or more essential oils, metals, antibiotics, organic acids, active compounds occurring in essential oil, essential oils with other compounds of natural origin or other compounds of plant origin e.g., alkaloids, triterpene saponins or chalcones and flavonoids. The proposed combination is characterized by innovation and, most importantly, high efficiency.Eucalyptus oil is very well known and used worldwide. Its properties have been widely described in the literature, with particular emphasis on antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. However, very little information can be found on its antiprotozoal activity. These properties were proved in the following study. Eucalyptus oil showed the same properties as the other tested combinations. It does not change the fact that its effectiveness in combination with acids and metal ions was very high at low concentrations.Another essential oil analyzed was tea tree essential oil. For years, it has not only been the subject of research, but also an ingredient in many antifungal products. It is also undoubtedly effective against Trichomonas vaginalis. A human trial showed that a dose of 0.4% tea tree essential oil was as effective as metronidazole treatment. Similar results were obtained in the following work. However, another study showed a 100% antiprotozoal efficacy of tea tree oil at 455 µL/L. Similar results were obtained in the following work. Baldissera et al. showed a much higher effective concentration, 1–2%, in their study. Other tests also showed its high antiprotozoal efficacy, but also high selectivity of the main component of tea tree oil—terpinen-4-ol. The composition containing tea tree oil, together with a mixture of organic acids and metal ions, had the best antiprotozoal properties among the combinations tested. It exhibited a mostly lethal effect, against 50% of the population, at concentrations in the range of 0.001–0.004%.Cedar essential oil shows very strong antibacterial, antiviral, insecticidal and antiprotozoal properties. Studies have shown that in its pure form, it has efficacy levels of LD50 = 0.04–1% and LD100 = 0.06–0.25% against analyzed protozoa. Obtained concentrations were very low. Unlike the C. deodara species, Cedrus libani did not show antiprotozoal properties against Leishmania major. Nisha et al. showed similar activity and effective concentration against the adult form of Setaria digitata. In their study, Kar et al. showed a significant enhancement of the effect of cedrol, one of the major components of cedar essential oil, as a cedrol-loaded nano-structured lipid carrier. In our studies, the combination of cedar oil with a mixture of acids and metal ions showed very good antiprotozoal properties in the range of 0.001–0.008% against the analyzed protozoa. Compared to the values obtained for cedar essential oil, it is 40 times and more than 30 times more potent, LD50 and LD100, respectively.Many studies present the high activity effects of lavender oil against microorganisms. However, there are few reports in the literature on its antiprotozoal activity. The results presented in this paper allow us to conclude that lavender oil, especially in the proposed combinations, show very good antiprotozoal properties. The values for pure lavender oil were promising, while the combinations performed only confirmed this. All analyzed variants of lavender essential oil, mixture of acids and Cu, Mn, Zn ions (LMCu, LMMn and LMZn) showed strong protozoicidal activity at the level of 0.001–0.008%.This article shows the very good antiprotozoal properties of the innovative combinations. The results obtained in this research are often even a hundred times stronger than those of standard antibiotics.It is necessary to conduct further tests with using the analyzed mixtures. The obligatory element is undoubtedly the analysis of the toxicity of the combination and its direct influence on organs, as well as accumulation in tissues. However, the mixtures obtained have a very high potential and can be used not only in medicine and pharmacy, but also in the prophylaxis of diseases caused by protozoa, both in humans and animals.","In the presented work, a hitherto unused combination of three types of compounds: essential oils, organic acids and metal ions, was used. It has been proved that the proposed combinations show very strong antiprotozoal activity. Studies conducted so far allow to conclude the synergistic effect of these combinations and obtain protozoicidal results much better than standard antibiotics—chloramphenicol or metronidazole. Very high effectiveness against all of the analyzed protozoans was found in the combinations of tea tree, cedar and lavender essential oils, mixture of acids and all of the ions. The LD50 and LD100 values were in the range 0.001–0.009%. The highest antiprotozoal properties were obtained in the combination with cedar and tea tree essential oils, mixture of acids and manganese or zinc ions. The proposed combinations may find application in eradication of protozoan diseases both in humans and animals. However, further steps should be taken to analyze the antiprotozoal effect on model protozoa such as Cryptosporidium spp., Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma spp. as well as toxicological studies of the effective concentrations."
18,TA002243,10.3390/ijms22020605,Biochemical Characterization and Function of Eight Microbial Type TerpeneSynthases from Lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii.,"Selaginella moellendorffii is a lycophyte, a member of an ancient vascular plantlineage. Two distinct types of terpene synthase (TPS) genes were identified fromthis species, including S. moellendorffii TPS genes (SmTPSs) and S.moellendorffii microbial TPS-like genes (SmMTPSLs). The goal of this study was toinvestigate the biochemical functions of SmMTPSLs. Here, eight full-lengthSmMTPSL genes (SmMTPSL5, -15, -19, -23, -33, -37, -46, and -47) were functionallycharacterized from S. moellendorffii. Escherichia coli-expressed recombinantSmMTPSLs were tested for monoterpenes synthase and sesquiterpenes synthaseactivities. These enzymatic products were typical monoterpenes and sesquiterpenesthat have been previous shown to be generated by typical plant TPSs when providedwith geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrates.Meanwhile, SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 were up-regulated when induced by alamethicin(ALA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), suggesting a role for these genes in plantsresponse to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, this study pointed out that theterpenoids products of SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 have an antibacterial effect onPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and Staphylococcus aureus. Taken together,these results provide more information about the catalytic and biochemicalfunction of SmMTPSLs in S. moellendorffii plants.","Zhao, Yapei, Hu, Tian, Liu, Ruiqi, Hao, Zhiqiang, Liang, Guoyan, Li, Guanglin",2021,International journal of molecular sciences,2,True,True,True,"[""**1. introduction** Terpenoids are the largest class of specialized secondary metabolites, which are widely distributed in nature with large quantities and diverse structures [\\[1\\]](#page-11-0). Terpenoids form an essential part of direct and indirect defense systems against herbivores and pathogens [\\[2\\]](#page-11-1). They are the derivatives of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are mainly produced by the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) and the plastidial 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathways *in plants* [\\[3](#page-11-2)[–5\\]](#page-11-3). The sequential head-to-tail condensation of IPP and DMAPP in the presence of prenyltransferases produces the immediate precursors of terpenes, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), which are converted into monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), and diterpenes (C20), respectively, by the activity of terpene synthases (TPSs) [\\[6–](#page-11-4)[8\\]](#page-11-5).

Despite increasing knowledge of the anatomical and biochemical processes of induced terpenoid defenses in *S. moellendorffii*, detailed molecular and biochemical dissection of these complex defense systems is currently limited by lack of identification and functional characterization of the *SmMTPSL* genes involved. Six *SmMTPSL* genes were characterized in a previous study [\\[12\\]](#page-11-9). However, most *SmMTPSL* genes, their particular biochemical functions and their contribution to chemical defense remain to be discovered and functionally characterized. In the present study, we sequentially characterized another eight *SmMTPSL* genes to investigate their biological functions in nonseed plants. First, these eight full-length *SmMTPSL* genes were identified by analyzing the available genomic and transcriptomic resources from *S. moellendorffii.* Next, we analyzed the phylogenetic relatedness of eight *SmMTPSL* genes with other known *MTPSLs.* Furthermore, in vitro biochemical characterization were performed, suggesting that SmMTPSLs display monoterpene synthase and sesquiterpene synthase activities. In addition, expression analysis of three *SmMTPSL* genes showed that SmMTPSLs in *S. moellendorffii* is responsible for the biosynthesis of stress-induced terpenoids. Lastly, it had been demonstrated that the enzymatic products of SmMTPSLs have an anti-bacterial activity in vitro.

Plants were used for experiments at the height of 5 inches [\\[32\\]](#page-12-17). In order to maximize the quantitative and qualitative volatile emission and upregulate expression of *SmMTPSL* genes, plants were sprayed with 100 µM MeJA or 0.1 mg/L ALA (dissolved in 0.1% (*v/v*) ethanol). Treated leaves were sampled at 1.5, 3, 6, and 9 h after treatment for RNA isolation.

SmMTPSLs were identified from the peptides using Pfam model PF03936, which correspond to the conserved domains localized at the C termini of known TPSs [\\[12\\]](#page-11-9). The isoelectric point of the proteins and their signal peptide were analyzed on the websites of ScienceGateway [\\(http://www.sciencegateway.org/tools/proteinmw.htm\\)](http://www.sciencegateway.org/tools/proteinmw.htm) and TargetP 1.1 Server [\\(http:](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP) [//www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP\\)](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP), respectively. The setting parameter of TargetP was Organism group: Plant; predict scope: Perform cleavage site predictions. Multiple sequence alignment was performed with Clustal Omega and the final result was generated using the software GeneDoc. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with MEGA6.0 using the maximum likelihood phylogenies with 1000 bootstrap repetitions. Bayesian inference was calculated with MrBayes3.2.4. Four Markov chains were run for 2 runs from random starting trees for 2 million generations, and trees were sampled every 100 generations. The first one-fourth generations were discarded as burn-in. A majority rule consensus tree of all remaining trees was calculated. Branches that received bootstrap support for maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP) greater or equal than 70% (ML) and 0.9 (BPP), respectively, were considered as significantly supported. ITOL was used to visualize the phylogenetic tree.

', ""*4.4. cloning of smmtpsls full-length cdna and expression in e. coli* The total RNA was extracted from the leaves of *S. moellendorffii* using Plant RNA Isolation Kit (BEI-BEI Biotech, Zhengzhou, China) and cDNA was synthesized by PCR using the HIScript II Q RT SuperMix (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then PCR products were cloned into the protein expression vector pCold-TF and were fully sequenced. All primers used were listed in Table S3. The constructs and insert-free pCold-TF (negative control) were used to transform *E. coli* strain BL21 (DE3) [\\[44\\]](#page-13-0). *E. coli* BL21 (DE3) containing target plasmid was preincubated overnight at 37 ◦C in Luria-Bertani (LB) media supplemented with 50 µg/mL chloramphenicol and 50 µg/mL ampicillin. The culture was transferred into 200 mL LB media and grown at 37 ◦C with shaking (200 rpm) until an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5–0.7 [\\[14\\]](#page-11-11). Protein expression was then induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and cells were grown with shaking (200 rpm) at 15 ◦C for 24 h. Then the cells were harvested with centrifugation (5000 rpm, 5 min), resuspended in PBS buffer, and homogenized by sonication on ice. The recombinant proteins were purified by a Ni-NTA Sefinose His-bind column according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentrations were detected using the Bradford reagent (Amresco, Shanghai, China) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard [\\[45\\]](#page-13-1). SDS-PAGE analysis was used to detect the purity of recombinant protein. "", '*4.5. identification of terpenoid products by gc-ms* To determine the catalytic activity of SmMTPSLs, enzyme assays were carried out in a 2 mL GC glass vial, containing 100 µL purified recombinant proteins and 100 µL substrates buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM Na2WO4, 0.1 mM NaF, and 10 µM FPP or GPP). Assays with the pCold-TF vector proteins without insert were used as control. A solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) fiber was placed in the headspace of the vial over the reaction mixture for 1 h at 37 ◦C. Then, the SPME fiber was subsequently inserted into the gas chromatograph injector. Volatile components were analyzed by a Shimadzu 17A gas chromatograph coupled to a quadrupole mass selective detector (QP5050A; Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA). The separation was performed on an RTX-1MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm thick, Restek, Shimadzu). Electronic impact (EI) mode was at 70 eV. The initial temperature of the column box was 50 ◦C (hold for 3 min) and increased to 100 ◦C at a rate of 10 ◦C/min. Then the temperature was increased to 160 ◦C at a rate of 3 ◦C/min and then to 230 ◦C at a rate of 10 ◦C/min, and finally to 260 ◦C at a rate of 5 ◦C/min (hold for 3 min). The flow rate of the carrier gas (helium) was 7.8 mL/min. Terpenoids products were identified by comparison of their retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic standards analyzed under the same conditions. Compounds identification was based on similarity to library matches (NIST.11, NIST.11s). ', '*4.6. real-time qpcr analyses* The leaves of MeJA(ALA)-treated and control *S. moellendorffii* plants were used to extract the total RNA. Then, 2µg RNA was reverse transcribed for analyses of gene expression. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in a 20µL reaction volume using SYBR Green dye. The expression level of *S. moellendorffii glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase* (*GAPDH*) gene was used to normalize the expression of *SmMTPSLs.* The PCR program was 95 ◦C (3 min), followed by 45 cycles at 95 ◦C (10 s) and 60 ◦C (30 s). Specific primer pairs were designed with Primer 6.0 software. All primers used are listed in Table S3. The relative expression level of *SmTPSLs* genes was calculated using the 2−∆∆CT method. Three biological replicates were analyzed. ', '*4.7. antibacterial effect of terpenoid products* Two pathogenic bacteria, *Pst* DC3000 and *S. aureus*, were used for the test of antibacterial effect of terpenoid products. A 5 mL preculture of bacteria (*Pst* DC3000 and *S. aureus*, respectively) from a single colony was grown overnight at 30 ◦C in Luria-Bertani (LB) media. Then 100 µL purified SmMTPSLs protein (50 µg/mL) and 100 µL substrates buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM Na2WO4, 0.1 mM NaF, and 10 µM FPP) were incubated for 1 h at 37 ◦C. After 1 h, the 200 µL enzymatic products and 100 µL bacterial suspension were cultured in a 24-well cell culture plate. Besides, the wells with each bacterial suspension were added only substrates buffer as a control group. The 24-well cell culture plates were cultured for four days at 37 ◦C, and the number of colonies was recorded daily through the dilution gradient plate method. The inhibition rate of SmMTPSLs products on these two strains was calculated according to the following formula: (control group average colony- forming units (cfu)—treatment group average cfu)/control group average cfu × 100%.

']nan","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","[""**3. discussion** In an attempt to identify genes of direct and putative indirect terpenoid defenses in *S. moellendorffii* and to provide a better foundation for phylogenetic analysis of the MTPSLs in nonseed plants family, eight full-length *SmMTPSL* genes were selected and functionally characterized from *S. moellendorffii*. The eight SmMTPSLs all contain two highly conserved motifs: 'DDxxD' and 'NSD/DTE' (Figure [1\\)](#page-2-0). Most MTPSLs, like typical plant TPSs, harbor a canonical aspartate-rich motif: 'DDxxD'. The aspartate-rich motif functions in binding a cluster of three Mg2+ ions, which in term binds to the isoprenyl diphosphate substrates [\\[24\\]](#page-12-6). The binding leads to conformational changes of the active site, initiating the ionization and cyclization reaction. To the best of our knowledge, TPS function through divalent metal ion dependent generation of enzyme bound carbocation intermediates [\\[25](#page-12-7)[–27\\]](#page-12-8). The phylogenetic analysis showed that all SmMTPSLs clustered with four MTPSLs from ferns and were similar to TPSs found in fungi and bacteria, which were consistent with the conclusion in the previous literature [\\[12,](#page-11-9)[14\\]](#page-11-11). According to the docking result of SmMTPSL19 with FPP or GPP, the amino acids D93, K238, R321, K57, S53, and S98 were easy to form hydrogen bond with the ligand, making the binding of ligand and receptor more stable (Figure [3\\)](#page-4-0). The remaining structure models and molecular docking also made clear that the other seven SmMTPSLs could successfully connect with the FPP or GPP. These models and molecular docking have painted a picture of some of the amino acids involved in the active sites of these SmMTPSLs and provided some level of confidence for modeling of SmMTPSLs, which will direct future experiments to analyze the involvement of these amino acids in catalysis. Through this, we hope to pinpoint amino acids involved in catalysis and provide a basis for future site directed mutagenesis of SmMTPSLs. As shown in our study, the eight SmMTPSLs were all determined to be functional, respectively, based on in vitro assays of the heterologously expressed proteins. All of them could use GPP or FPP as the substrate to display monoterpene synthase and sesquiterpene synthase activities (Figures [4](#page-5-0) and [5\\)](#page-6-0). Like previously characterized MTPSLs from *S. moellendorffii* [\\[12\\]](#page-11-9), we note that all functional SmMTPSLs were also multi-product enzymes possessing sesquiterpene synthase activity in the present study. With some of them producing two or three sesquiterpenes, SmMTPSL15 appeared capable of producing as many as six sesquiterpenes. In this context, it is noteworthy that many typical plant TPSs are multi-product enzymes [\\[28–](#page-12-9)[30\\]](#page-12-10). Another interesting observation is that the product profiles of SmMTPSL5 and SmMTPSL33 share strong similarities and both produce farnesol and aromadendrene (Figure [5\\)](#page-6-0). However, SmMTPSL5 and SmMTPSL33 share only 38% identity at the protein sequence level. It is thus an interesting question whether such similarity in catalytic activity reflects common ancestry or convergent evolution. Terpenoids play significant ecological roles in the interactions between plants and stress conditions. As the critical gene in terpenoid biosynthesis, the expression level of *TPS* genes in different plants under various stress conditions were widely reported [\\[31](#page-12-11)[–34\\]](#page-12-12). Both MeJA and ALA treatments regulated *SmMTPSL* genes expression (Figure [6\\)](#page-7-0). The expression level of *SmMTPSL23*, *-33*, and *-37* were enhanced after the MeJA treatment with the most notable enhancement occurred to *SmMTPSL33* (13.5-fold) at 1.5 h, followed by *SmMTPSL37* (7.9-fold) at 3 h. Besides, the most remarkably up-regulation was found for *SmMTPSL23* (4-fold) at 6 h, followed by *SmMTPSL33* (5.1-fold) at 3 h after the ALA treatment (Figure [6\\)](#page-7-0). The induction of *SmMTPSLs* expression in *S. moellendorffii* by MeJA or ALA supports that *TPS* genes play a role in defense against abiotic stresses. In addition, some genes shared the same induction alteration among two different treatments, suggesting that some genes may respond to the abiotic stresses in similar ways. The antimicrobial activity of a variety of terpenoids has been described earlier by several authors [\\[19–](#page-12-3)[22](#page-12-4)[,35,](#page-12-13)[36\\]](#page-12-14). The inhibitory effects of some pure terpenes and terpenoids on some bacteria and fungi for humans as well as phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi have already been reported. Based on the bacterial-inhibition assay [\\[37–](#page-12-15)[40\\]](#page-12-16), the present study pointed out that the enzymatic products of three SmMTPSLs (SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37) at the proper concentration reduced the growth of bacteria, especially against *S. aureus*, gram-positive bacteria (Figure [7\\)](#page-7-1). This phenomenon made clear that terpenoids products act as a chemical defense against pathogenic infection and provide a chemical interpretation for the varied resistance or tolerance. It is worth remembering that the three SmMTPSLs are multi-product enzymes, so it will be significant to further evaluate the anti-bacterial effects of terpenoid compounds individually and in combinations. Moreover, other in vitro studies need to confirm the antimicrobial activity of such sesquiterpenes towards a larger number of strains, which may guide future efforts to characterize the anti-bacteria effect of terpenoid products in *S. moellendorffii.* ""]",
19,TA036860,10.3892/mmr.2016.5431,Tanshinone IIA attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune neurodegenerative disease,which features focal demyelination and inflammatory cell infiltration of thebrain and the spinal cord. Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA), one of the major fat‑solublecomponents of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), has anti‑inflammatory,immunoregulatory and neuroprotective activity; however, its efficacy in MSremains unknown. The current study was designed to investigate the potentialtherapeutic function of TSIIA on MS in the experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model. In comparison to the vehicle control group,the TSIIA‑treated groups showed notably improved clinical symptoms andpathological changes, including central nervous system inflammatory cellinfiltration and demyelination. Following administration of TSIIA, the quantityof CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and macrophages/microglia in the spinal cord werereduced to different extents. Furthermore, TSIIA was also shown to downregulateinterleukin (IL)‑17 and IL‑23 levels in the brain and serum of EAE rats. Theresults collectively provide evidence that TSIIA alleviates EAE and support itsutility as a novel therapy for MS.","Yan, Jun, Yang, Xue, Han, Dong, Feng, Juan",2016,Molecular medicine reports,2,False,False,True,"MS is a progressive autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which is mediated via various inflammatory cells and cytokines. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has been universally acknowledged as an animal model for MS, as it has similar clinical and neuropathological features. In MS/EAE, once activated, circulating T cells travel from the periphery to the CNS and generate large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Then microglia and invaded macrophages are consequently activated, and stimulate autoimmune reactions, leading to myelin damage. CD4+ T cells are the predominant cell type involved in the pathology of MS/EAE. Mice without functional CD4+ T cells do not develop the relevant clinical signs of disease. CD8+ T cells also accumulate and activate microglia to an extent, causing tissue damage during CNS autoimmunity. In the CNS, Mac-1 is expressed predominantly on the surface of resident microglia cells and infiltrating inflammatory macrophages, and therefore used to identify activated microglia/macrophages in EAE.The interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 axis performs important functions in MS pathogenesis. IL-23 is predominantly secreted from activated macrophages/microglia and dendritic cells, inducing Th0 cell differentiation into Th17 cells. This type of shift facilitates CNS inflammation and the development of EAE. Th17 cells are characterized by the secretion of IL-17. IL-23 and IL-17 in the serum and CNS have been reported to serve an important role in the pathology and immunotherapy of MS.MS is a debilitating disease with high disability and recurrence rates and there are over one million people worldwide suffering from the disease. The treatment of MS is limited to chemically synthesized immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive reagents, which are not always effective and are often associated with severe side-effects. Thus, the identification of more effective and safe agents is urgently required. Salvia miltiorrhiza, a Chinese herbal medicine, has traditionally been used to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA), its major bioactive constituent, has been shown to exert immunomodulatory effects on various immune cells and cytokines, with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and neuroprotective functions. TSIIA has been shown to exert a therapeutic effect in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. It has also been shown to be effective in inflammatory and autoimmunity diseases, including acute lung inflammation, sepsis and systemic sclerosis.Considering these findings, the present study examined the hypothesis that TSIIA can be effectively used for EAE treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that TSIIA alleviates EAE by downregulating the IL-23/IL-17 inflammatory pathway and reducing the infiltration of immune cell populations supporting its potential as an effective therapeutic agent for MS.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra was purchased from Difco Laboratories, Inc.

From day 0 p.i. the body weight of all rats was measured daily and clinical signs were also evaluated by two independent observers using the scale shown in Table I.On day 18 p.i., all the rats were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion of PBS (pH 7.4) through the left ventricle under anesthesia with injection of 10% chloral hydrate (3 ml/kg; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) into the abdominal cavity, and spinal cord and brain samples were obtained. Lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord and right-hand side of the brain were paraformalde-hyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Subsequently, 3-µm slices of brain were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) to evaluate inflammatory infiltration. In addition, 3-µm slices of spinal cord were sectioned and stained with LFB to evaluate demyelination. Histopathological assessment was performed in a blinded according to Table II.Slices (3 µm) of brain and spinal cord were used for immunohistochemical staining. After deparaffinization with xylene and washing with PBS, sections of spinal cords were incubated with rabbit antibodies specific for CD4 (diluted 1:200), CD8 (diluted 1:200), Mac-1 (diluted 1:200), IL-17 (diluted 1:200) and IL-23 (diluted 1:200). Biotin-labeled anti-rabbit IgG was used as a secondary antibody for the detection of primary antibodies. Color was developed with DAB. CD4-, CD8- and Mac-1-positive cells were counted under 400-fold magnification in the ventricornu of spinal cord sections. Expression of IL-23 and IL-17 was assessed based on the integral optical density (IOD) of positive cells under 200-fold magnification in a restricted area of brain sections. Five fields in the restricted area were randomly selected for calculations. All measurements and data analysis were performed independently by two pathologists in a blinded manner. Morphometric analysis was conducted using Image-Pro Plus 6.0.Brain and spinal cord from each group was respectively homogenized in lysis buffer with protease inhibitors and RIPA for protein extraction. Tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to obtain the supernatants. The BCA protein assay kit was used to measure protein concentrations. Protein samples (30 µg/well) were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and elec-trotransferred onto a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 2 h at normal temperature, the membranes were separately incubated with rabbit anti-CD4 (diluted 1:500), rabbit anti-CD8 (diluted 1:500), rabbit anti-Mac-1 (diluted 1:300), rabbit anti-IL-17 (diluted 1:500), rabbit anti-IL-23 (diluted 1:500) and mouse anti-β-actin (diluted 1:1,000) overnight at 4°C. The following day, membranes were washed three times with TBST (5 min/wash), then were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary or goat anti-mouse secondary (diluted 1:2,000) antibody for 2 h. Following incubation, the membranes were washed three times with TBST (5 min/wash). Bands were treated with Luminol reagent for 1 min and visualized using the Electrophoresis Gel Imaging Analysis system. Band density was calculated via Image J 1.36 software. Protein bands were compared with that of β-actin to determine the relative expression level of target protein.On day 18 p.i., all the rats were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion of PBS (pH 7.4) through the left ventricle under anesthesia with injection of 10% chloral hydrate (3 ml/kg) into the abdominal cavity, and blood was collected via retro-orbital bleeding to collect the serum. IL-17 and IL-23 concentrations were detected using ELISA according to the specifications strictly.The results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. GraphPad PRISM 6.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was utilized to conduct all statistical analyses. Multiple comparisons were performed by Kruskal-Wallis test or one-way analysis of variance, followed by the least significant differences test, as appropriate. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.","Clinical signs of EAE development in rats from the vehicle group began to appear on day 9 p.i., including loss of appetite, reduced physical activity, and tail and limb paralysis. However, EAE onset in TSIIA-treated rats occurred on day 11 p.i. (TSIIA-H) and 10 p.i. (TSIIA-L). Compared with the vehicle group, the two TSIIA-treated groups received significantly lower clinical scores (P<0.01). Significant differences were also observed between the treated groups, which were dose-dependent (P<0.01; Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the body weights of untreated EAE rats were significantly decreased, compared with the naive and TSIIA-treated rats (all P<0.01) while those of TSIIA-treated groups were only marginally reduced, with the smallest recorded weight loss in the TSIIA-H group. Significant differences in body weight were observed between the two treatment groups (P<0.01; Fig. 1B).Since inflammatory cell invasion and CNS demyelination are the key characteristics of EAE, the impact of TSIIA on these parameters was verified. Consistent with clinical scores, rats in the vehicle group exhibited typical inflammatory cell infiltration in the brain, as determined via H&E staining. This cell infiltration was dose dependently attenuated following TSIIA treatment (Fig. 2A). Similarly, LFB staining revealed large areas of demyelination in the spinal cord of rats from the vehicle group, which were significantly decreased in the treated groups (both P<0.01; Fig. 2B). These results clearly indicate a beneficial effect of TSIIA in reducing inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination, which provide the basement of mitigated clinical signs following TSIIA treatment.To identify the types of infiltrating cells in the CNS of EAE rats, immunohistochemistry was performed. Inflammatory exudates included a mixture of cell types, including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, microglia and macrophages (Fig. 3A–L). Compared with the vehicle group, TSIIA administration at the two doses induced a significant decrease in the quantity of CD4+ T cells (P<0.01), CD8+ T cells (P<0.01), macrophages and microglia (P<0.01) (Fig. 3M–O). The results were confirmed by quantification of the western blots and were consistent with the results of immunostaining (P<0.05; Fig. 4A, B and C).Expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-17 and IL-23, is usually increased in the CNS in EAE. To assess whether TSIIA exerts anti-inflammatory activity in EAE in vivo, its effects on IL-23 and IL-17 levels in the brain were determined using immunohistochemistry. Compared with the naive group, expression of IL-17 and IL-23 in the vehicle groups was significantly increased (P<0.01). Compared with the vehicle group, TSIIA treatment significantly induced a reduction in IL-17 and IL-23 expression (P<0.01). However, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups (P>0.05; Fig. 5). The effects of TSIIA on these indicators were further confirmed by quantitative western blot analysis (P<0.01), and significant differences were identified between the TSIIA-L and TSIIA-H groups in IL-17 (P<0.01) and IL-23 (P<0.05) expression (Fig. 4 A, E and F).The serum contents of IL-17 and IL-23 are usually upregulated and closely associated with the development of EAE. The highest concentrations of serum IL-17 and IL-23 among all groups were found in vehicle-treated rats, which decreased significantly in the two TSIIA-treated groups (P<0.01). The serum level of IL-17 in the TSIIA-H group was lower than that in the TSIIA-L group (P<0.01). However, no significant difference was identified in the serum concentrations of IL-23 between the two TSIIA-treated groups (Fig. 6).","TSIIA has been shown to alleviate several CNS disorders in animal models, possibly through its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, the effects of TSIIA on EAE have not been determined to date. In the current study, an experimental model was established to determine the effects of TSIIA on EAE and its mechanisms of action.In MS and EAE, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages and resident microglia orchestrate a series of inflammatory reactions in the CNS of humans and animals, resulting in persistent disability. CD4+ cells are undoubtedly the pivotal pathogenic cells in MS and EAE that facilitate inflammatory reactions and subsequent neurodegeneration. These cells induce neuronal death under pathological conditions through a variety of mechanisms, such as triggering antigen-independent calcium oscillations and TRAIL-mediated injury in neurons. A number of therapeutic options that reduce the T cell- and particularly, CD4+ cell-mediated damage of neurons are extensively applied in the clinic. For example, natalizumab, an effective drug for MS, decreases the number of CD4+ cells in the brain and inhibits peripheral lymphocyte migration into the CNS. CD8+ T cells are also crucial in CNS autoimmunity. These cells are abundant in active demyelinating lesions in MS, and induce inflammation and demyelination in EAE. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between the degree of axonal injury and the quantity of CD8+ T cells as well as macrophages/microglia in the brain tissue from patients with MS, suggesting their important effects on axon loss. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells secrete various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including perforin and granzymes, which trigger autoimmune injury mediated by cells in the CNS. Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate, a water-soluble derivative of TSIIA, has been shown to markedly suppress the proliferation of spleen T lymphocytes and reduce the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell percentage in peripheral blood in a rat skin transplantation model. Additionally, TSIIA inhibits the maturation of dendritic cells and suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, weakening their capacity to stimulate T-cell proliferation. Data from the current study showed that TSIIA downregulates the increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the CNS and relieves clinical symptoms.Macrophages in the CNS are derived from peripheral monocytes, and microglia are resident macrophages. Once activated, microglia and macrophages cause mitochondrial dysfunction through induction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which contribute to axon injury and subsequent neuronal cell death. Activated microglia and macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhance sensitization of axons to glutamate, with subsequent initiation of an indirect immunological attack on oligodendrocytes and neurons. TSIIA reduces the release of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, from macrophages during inflammation. Microglial activation, a hallmark of CNS pathology in MS and other neurode-generative diseases, triggers cytotoxic effects and drives neuronal damage, which can be suppressed by TSIIA in experimental models of SNL-induced neuropathic pain and Parkinson's disease. Macrophage depletion and microglial paralysis markedly alleviate disease progression. Consistently, compared with wild-type mice, Mac-1-deficient mice displayed attenuated EAE with lower levels of gliosis, axonal degeneration and demyelination. To the best of our knowledge, no studies regarding the impact of TSIIA on microglia/macrophages in CNS of EAE are have been conducted. The results from this study showed that following TSIIA treatment, microglia/macrophage numbers are decreased following decreased demyelination and inflammatory cell infiltration in the CNS of EAE rats.The IL-17/IL-23 pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, including MS, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. IL-23-deficient mice are unable to induce EAE. IL-23 is reported to promote polarization, development and expansion of pathogenic T cells; thus, it is essential for EAE induction.. As a lineage of major pathogenic T cells, Th17 cells not only autosynthesize but also promote other types of cells to generate pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Th17 cells transmigrate efficiently across the blood brain barrier, damage neurons and contribute to CNS inflammation through CD4+ lymphocyte accumulation. Targeting IL-23-p19 with neutralizing antibodies has been shown to reduce the IL-17 level in the CNS and serum, which was also shown to prevent EAE relapse during disease remission. Serum IL-17 levels are positively correlated with disease severity and EAE is inhibited in IL-17−/− mice whose CD4+ T cells are incapable of inducing EAE efficiently, compared with wild-type T cells. IL-17 also stimulates microglia and astrocytes to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in recruitment of neutro-phils. In collaboration with TNF-α, IL-17 promotes oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of oligodendrocytes, causing axonal loss and subsequent neurological deficits. In an earlier phase II clinical trial, following treatment with secukinumab, an antibody that neutralizes IL-17, MS patients displayed fewer new CNS lesions observed using magnetic resonance imaging, and lower annualized recurrence rates, compared with placebo-treated patients. Therefore, blockage of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in the clinical treatment of MS has recently received considerable research attention, in view of accumulating data highlighting its vital role in MS/EAE. TSIIA has been shown to inhibit IL-17-induced vascular remodeling in systemic sclerosis patients. However, no research to date has investigated the impact of TSIIA on IL-17 and IL-23 levels in EAE/MS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a significant decrease in serum and brain expression of IL-17 and IL-23 in EAE following TSIIA treatment.In conclusion, this study provides preliminary evidence supporting the use of TSIIA as a potential novel therapeutic option for MS. However, rats in this study were only treated acutely, and the feasibility and safety of TSIIA require validation in the clinic.",
20,TA019138,10.3389/fpls.2021.740524,Metabolomics Analysis Reveals Drought Responses of Trifoliate Orange byArbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi With a Focus on Terpenoid Profile.,"Soil water deficit seriously affects crop production, and soil arbuscularmycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance drought tolerance in crops by unclear mechanisms.Our study aimed to analyze changes in non-targeted metabolomics in roots oftrifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) seedlings under well-watered and soildrought after inoculation with Rhizophagus intraradices, with a focus onterpenoid profile. Root mycorrhizal fungal colonization varied from 70% undersoil drought to 85% under soil well-watered, and shoot and root biomass wasincreased by AMF inoculation, independent of soil water regimes. A total of 643secondary metabolites in roots were examined, and 210 and 105 differentialmetabolites were regulated by mycorrhizal fungi under normal water and droughtstress, along with 88 and 17 metabolites being up-and down-regulated underdrought conditions, respectively. KEGG annotation analysis of differentialmetabolites showed 38 and 36 metabolic pathways by mycorrhizal inoculation undernormal water and drought stress conditions, respectively. Among them, 33metabolic pathways for mycorrhization under drought stress included purinemetabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism,etc. We also identified 10 terpenoid substances, namely albiflorin, artemisinin(-)-camphor, capsanthin, β-caryophyllene, limonin, phytol, roseoside, sweroside,and α-terpineol. AMF colonization triggered the decline of almost alldifferential terpenoids, except for β-caryophyllene, which was up-regulated bymycorrhizas under drought, suggesting potential increase in volatile organiccompounds to initiate plant defense responses. This study provided an overview ofAMF-induced metabolites and metabolic pathways in plants under drought, focusingon the terpenoid profile.","Liang, Sheng-Min, Zhang, Fei, Zou, Ying-Ning, Kuča, Kamil, Wu, Qiang-Sheng",2021,Frontiers in plant science,2,True,False,True,"[""introduction Crops are often subjected to abiotic stresses in the process of the growth and development, while abiotic stress also activates relevant functional genes and metabolic pathways to mitigate the stress damage of crops ([Giordano et al., 2021](#page-9-0)). Plant stress regulation is a complex network, and it is difficult to fully analyze the responsive mechanisms of plants to stress by studying a single gene or metabolic pathway alone [\\(Li et al., 2017](#page-9-1); [Yang et al., 2021\\)](#page-10-0). Metabolomics is a powerful tool to assess the whole change of organisms at the metabolite level [\\(Alseekh](#page-9-2)  [et al., 2018\\)](#page-9-2) and also is essential for understanding the chemical signals during plant growth and development [\\(Carrera et al.,](#page-9-3)  [2021\\)](#page-9-3). In the analysis of metabolomics, metabolites are small molecules that are formed and/or altered during metabolisms, and changes of metabolite profiles can establish a close relationship between genotype and phenotype and also reveal the plant–environment interaction comprehensively and systematically ([Bernardo et al., 2019;](#page-9-4) [Carrera et al., 2021](#page-9-3)). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), subphylum Glomeromycotina of the phylum Mucoromycota, are the most widely distributed mycorrhizal fungi in soil, and can colonize the root of host plants to establish arbuscular mycorrhizal symbionts ([Kokkoris et al., 2020](#page-9-5)). Mycorrhizal fungi establish a well-developed network of extraradical mycelium outside the root system, which is directly involved in water and nutrient uptake and therefore responds to various environmental stresses including drought ([Meng et al., 2020;](#page-10-1) [Malhi et al., 2021](#page-10-2)). AMF-induced enhancement of drought tolerance is involved in many metabolic processes, such as proline, indoleacetic acid, polyamines, fatty acids, aquaporins, antioxidant defense system, H+ -ATPase, rhizospheric microenvironment, and so on [\\(Wu](#page-10-3)  [et al., 2019](#page-10-3); [He et al., 2020;](#page-9-6) [Khalil and El-Ansary, 2020](#page-9-7); [Sheteiwy](#page-10-4)  [et al., 2021](#page-10-4); [Zou et al., 2021;](#page-10-5) [Cheng et al., 2021a](#page-9-8)[,b,](#page-9-9)[c](#page-9-10)). Metabolomics analysis has been applied to reveal mycorrhizaassociated metabolite changes following AMF inoculation ([Rivero](#page-10-6)  [et al., 2015\\)](#page-10-6). However, very few studies have attempted to use metabolomics tool to analyze metabolite changes caused by AMF inoculation under abiotic stress (e.g., drought and salinity) conditions ([Rivero et al., 2018](#page-10-7); [Bernardo et al., 2019;](#page-9-4) [Yang](#page-10-8)  [et al., 2020\\)](#page-10-8). For example, [Yang et al. \\(2020\\)](#page-10-8) revealed that under saline conditions, inoculation with *Rhizophagus intraradices* induced changes in amino acids, organic acids, flavonoids, sterols, and hormones in *Puccinellia tenuiflora* plants to improve osmoregulation, maintain cell membrane stability, and enhance antioxidant systems. In wheat, *Funneliformis mosseae* mainly triggered sugars, lipids, and oleuropein lactones involved in stress mechanisms under drought stress ([Bernardo et al., 2019](#page-9-4)). These limited studies still revealed that arbuscular mycorrhizal symbionts responded to stress by regulating metabolic plasticity ([Rivero et al., 2018\\)](#page-10-7). Terpenoids are the most diverse and widely distributed class of secondary metabolites present in plants. Terpenoids are volatile, serve as mediators of communication between plants and other organisms, and are biologically and ecologically important for the plants' own reproduction and defense [\\(Jiang,](#page-9-11)  [2012\\)](#page-9-11). They guarantee the survival of plants in stressed environments by performing several functions, such as protecting plant tissues from pathogens or herbivores and helping reproduction by attracting pollinators or seed dispersers [\\(Quan,](#page-10-9)  [2013\\)](#page-10-9). Severe drought dramatically increased total monoterpenes and resin acids in *Pinus sylvestris* and *Picea abies* seedlings [\\(Turtola et al., 2003](#page-10-10)). In an aromatic plant *Tanacetum vulgare*, root terpenoids were obviously induced by drought, and such increase in root terpenoids would serve as more storage of resources for regrowth [\\(Kleine and Müller, 2014\\)](#page-9-12). Earlier studies have shown that secondary metabolites of many hosts such as terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids were regulated by AMF inoculation under drought conditions [\\(Bernardo et al., 2019\\)](#page-9-4). In *P*. *tenuiflora* seedlings, AMF inoculation under saline conditions significantly altered the relative concentrations of various metabolites, including amino acids, amines, carbohydrates, polyols, phytohormone, steroids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, flavonoids, organic acids, but terpenoids were not reported ([Yang et al., 2020\\)](#page-10-8). However, in two wheat cultivars, *F*. *mossea*e caused the change of terpenoids, along with the up-regulation of a limonene-1,2-doil and (20S)-ginsenoside Rh2 and the down-regulation of both 7-deoxyloganate and hemigossypol-6-methyl ether ([Bernardo et al., 2019](#page-9-4)). [Kaur and](#page-9-13)  [Suseela \\(2020\\)](#page-9-13) reviewed the changes in primary and secondary metabolites of plants induced by mycorrhizal fungi and concluded that host terpene metabolism is specific to the host-associated AMF and terpene species. It was shown that sesquiterpenoid cyclohexenone derivatives could be induced to increase by *Glomus intraradices* [\\(Maier et al., 1997\\)](#page-9-14) in the member of Poaceae, but sesquiterpenoid cyclohexenone glycoside was not induced by AMF under biotic and abiotic stresses. Various volatile terpenoids in host plants were also induced by AMF, resulting in an increased emission of these compounds in response to the environment [\\(Rapparini et al., 2007;](#page-10-11) [Fontana](#page-9-15)  [et al., 2009\\)](#page-9-15). It seems that terpenoids could be regulated by AMF inoculation under stress. Because of the wide variety of terpenoids, metabolomics is the way to clearly outline the response pattern for mycorrhizal inoculation under drought conditions, while how mycorrhizas respond to drought through changes of terpenoid profile is unclear. The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyze the changes in the metabolome of citrus (a drought-sensitive industrial crop) by AMF inoculation under soil well-watered and soil drought stress through non-targeted metabolomics, with a focus on the response of terpenoids in the differential metabolites to reveal the mechanisms by which mycorrhizas enhance plant drought tolerance. ""]","['materials and methods ', 'mycorrhizal inoculum An arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, *R*. *intraradices* (N.C. Schenck & G.S. Smith) C. Walker & A. Schüßler, was used. The mycorrhizal fungal strain (FLR12, Myke®PRO) was provided by the Premier Tech Ltd. (Quebec, Canada), which is a company for the production of commercial mycorrhizal inoculants. The Myke FLR12 strain of *R*. *intraradices* was designed for the improved growth of annuals and perennials and also presented positive effects on plant growth performance of trifoliate orange (*Poncirus trifoliata* L. Raf., a citrus rootstock; [Cheng et al., 2019](#page-9-16)). The purchased fungal strain was proliferated by employing white clover as the host plant in pots under the condition of 900 μmol/m2 /s photo density, 28°C/20°C day/night temperatures, and 68% relative air humidity. After 3 months, the white clover plants were harvested, the aboveground parts were removed, and the roots and potting substrates were collected. The roots were cut, mixed well with the growth substrate, dried naturally for 5 days, and collected as mycorrhizal fungal inoculum. Thus, the mycorrhizal inoculum contained AMF-colonized root segments, spores, sporocarps, and mycorrhizal mycelium. Harvested inocula were kept at 4°C for a maximum of 4 months. Prior to the application of AMF inocula, we used sucrose gradient centrifugation ([Brundrett et al., 1994](#page-9-17)) to isolate spores in the inocula and observed 19 spores/g inoculum. ', 'experimental design A 22 experimental design was used for this experiment. One factor was AMF inoculations with and without *R*. *intraradices*; the other factor was soil water regimes, including well-watered (75% of maximum field water holding capacity) and drought stress (55% of maximum field water holding capacity). As a result, there were four treatments in the experiment: the non-inoculated seedlings (non-AMF) under well-watered, the inoculated seedlings (AMF) under well-watered, the non-inoculated seedlings under drought stress, and the inoculated seedlings under drought stress. Each treatment was replicated 8 times, with a total of 32 pots. ', 'plant culture Trifoliate orange seeds were sterilized by 75% alcohol solutions for 5min, rinsed with distilled water three times, and germinated in sterile sand in an incubator at 28°C/20°C day/night temperature and relative air humidity of 80%. When the seedlings developed four leaves, the seedlings were transplanted into a 2.3-L plastic pot pre-filled with 2.8kg of autoclaved mixture with soil and sand (1:1, v:v). At transplanting, 100g of mycorrhizal fungal inoculums was applied into the pot as the AMF treatment, and the non-AMF treatment was correspondingly mixed with an equal amount of autoclaved mycorrhizal inocula. After transplanting, these seedlings were exposed to the condition of 900μmol/m2 /s photo density, 28°C/20°C day/night temperatures, and 68% relative air humidity and also grew in soil well-watered regime for 11weeks before soil drought treatment. 3days prior to soil drought stress, selected pots were stopped from watering and allowed to reach the designed soil moisture content for drought stress. Subsequently, half of the inoculated and non-inoculated plants were subjected to soil drought stress treatment for 9weeks, and the remaining plants were still grown under soil well-watered regime conditions for 9 weeks. The reduced water of pots was supplemented by weighing daily at 18:00pm. This study was conducted for 20weeks. ', 'determination of root mycorrhizal colonization and plant biomass At harvest plants were divided into shoots and roots, weighted and frozen with liquid nitrogen and immediately stored at−80°C for subsequent analysis. Five 1-cm-long root segments were cut from each plant, cleared in 10% KOH solution at 95°C for 1.5h, and stained with 0.05% trypan blue in lactophenol ([Phillips and Hayman,](#page-10-12)  [1970\\)](#page-10-12). The arbuscular mycorrhizal structure of roots was observed under a light microscope, and the root mycorrhizal colonization rate was estimated according to the following formula: Extraction of Metabolome Samples Root tissues were vacuum freeze-dried, and the dried samples were ground into a homogenous powder. Subsequently, 100mg of the powder was extracted with 70% methanol at 4°C overnight, vortexing and shaking three times during the extracted process. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000×g/min for 10min, and the supernatant was filtered through a microporous membrane (0.22μm), followed by LC–MS/MS analysis.

We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['discussion An important function of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is to accelerate the growth of the host plant, both under normal and unfavorable environmental conditions ([Malhi et al., 2021](#page-10-2)). Our study also confirmed that *R*. *intraradices* strongly promoted shoot and root biomass production in trifoliate orange regardless of soil moisture content, and the promoting effect was relatively higher under drought conditions than under well-watered conditions. [Zhang et al. \\(2018\\)](#page-10-14) used a device to separate mycorrhizal extraradical hyphae from inoculated trifoliate orange rhizosphere for quantitative estimation of hyphal water absorption rate and found that the hyphal water absorption rate was much higher under soil moisture-limited conditions than under soil moisture-sufficient conditions. This suggests that the improved plant growth of AMF is more important on arid soil than on saturated soil and therefore more attention needs to be paid to mycorrhizas in arid zones ([Allen, 2006\\)](#page-9-19). Metabolomic analyses implied changes in root metabolites of trifoliate orange seedlings in response to AMF inoculation. Among them, in non-inoculated plants, 50 differential metabolites were identified and metabolites were predominantly downregulated. Similarly, in quinoa (without AMF inoculation; *Chenopodium quinoa*), drought stress triggered 60 differential metabolites, 53 of which were down-regulated [\\(Shi et al., 2020](#page-10-15)); in tall fescue (*Festuca arundinacea*), drought stress caused 282 differential metabolites, 148 of which were down-regulated [\\(Li](#page-9-1)  [et al., 2017](#page-9-1)). However, in the inoculated trifoliate orange plants, 76 differential metabolites were identified, and these metabolites were predominantly up-regulated by drought stress. This result implied an elevated number of differential metabolites and a reversal of the metabolite response pattern from down-regulation (non-inoculated plants) to up-regulation (inoculated plants). <span id=""page-7-0""></span>![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg) ![](_page_7_Figure_3.jpeg) In the analysis of differential metabolite pathway, droughtinduced differential metabolites of non-inoculated plants and inoculated plants were annotated to 14 and 31 metabolic pathways, respectively. Among them, non-inoculated plants were dominated by amino acid (e.g., L-glutamic acid) metabolism and inoculated plants were dominated by sugars and amino acids (e.g., L-aspartic acid), showing the different metabolic responses of both. Thus, inoculated plants have stronger metabolic activity in response to drought stress than non-inoculated plants by means of predominant up-regulation, further indicating a higher drought tolerance potential of mycorrhizal plants versus non-mycorrhizal plants. In addition, the presence of mycorrhizal symbionts strongly stimulated the changes of metabolites in roots of trifoliate orange under well-watered and drought stress, showing, respectively, 210 and 105 differential metabolites, which were predominantly down-regulated under well-watered and up-regulated under soil drought. [Yang et al. \\(2020\\)](#page-10-8) also reported more up-regulated differential metabolites of *P*. *tenuiflora* seedlings under salinity after inoculation with *R*. *intraradices*. The annotated pathways of these differential metabolites were inconsistent in response to AMF inoculation under well-watered and drought stress, indicating different response mechanisms of mycorrhizal fungi promoting plants under different soil moisture conditions. Among the metabolic pathways, amino acids responded more effectively because they are the basic units of protein synthesis, and changes in them affect protein synthesis and thus interfere with normal physiological metabolism [\\(Yang et al., 2020](#page-10-8)).

[Bernardo et al. \\(2019\\)](#page-9-4) also identified 10 differential amino acids in drought-stressed wheat after AMF inoculation, 7 of which (4-amino-2-methyl-5-phosphomethylpyrimidine, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, imidazole acetol-phosphate, penicillamine, L-methionine/S-ethyl-L-cysteine, O-phospho-L-tyrosine, and 3ʹ-deamino-3ʹ-oxonicotianamine) were up-regulated, and three amino acids (2-amino-3-oxobutanoate, N-acetyl-DL-methionine, and cyclogutamate) were down-regulated. In *P*. *tenuiflora* seedlings subjected to saline stress, AMF inoculation positively promoted the accumulation of 10 amino acids and amines [\\(Yang et al.,](#page-10-8) [2020](#page-10-8)). [Salvioli et al. \\(2012\\)](#page-10-16) revealed the increase in the amino acid abundance in tomato fruits after inoculation with *G*. *mosseae.* In white clover, *R*. *intraradices* accelerated leaf glutamate, aspartate, arginine, and ornithine concentrations, which was associated with changes in N-assimilated enzyme activities [\\(Xie et al.,](#page-10-17) [2021](#page-10-17)). Mycorrhizal symbiosis accelerated the uptake of various amino acids in *Sorghum bicolor* such as phenylalanine, asparagine, arginine, tryptophan, etc., and the uptake of such neutral or positively charged amino acids was higher than that of negatively charged amino acids [\\(Whiteside et al., 2012](#page-10-18)). In addition, the increase in amino acids under mycorrhization may originate from the synthesis of mycorrhizal fungi [\\(Govindarajulu et al.,](#page-9-20) [2005](#page-9-20)). More amino acids were accumulated in mycorrhizal plants after stress, implying more protein synthesis under adversity. This facilitates mycorrhizalized plants to further improve osmoregulation, maintain cytoplasmic membrane permeability and nutrients, and thus enhance the response to stress signals [\\(Teixeira et al., 2020\\)](#page-10-19). Soil drought strongly affected the terpenoid content of plants, usually showing an increasing trend in total terpenes ([Turtola](#page-10-10) [et al., 2003;](#page-10-10) [Jiang, 2012\\)](#page-9-11). In our study, drought stress induced a significant accumulation of phytol in roots of non-inoculated plants as well as sweroside in inoculated plants, while inhibited the decrease in capsanthin, caryophyllene, and terpineol on non-inoculated plants. Similarly, [Podda et al. \\(2019\\)](#page-10-20) also revealed the increase in phytol in *Brassica oleracea* plants in response to drought stress. It seems that phytol, a product of chlorophyll degradation, served as an important indicator of the state of chlorophyll. Other studies in *C*. *aurantium*, *Eucalyptus camaldulensis*, and *Thymus transcaucasicus* showed diverse changes in metabolites under environmental stresses (drought, salinity, and temperature stresses) conditions, along with the reduction of metabolites more commonly [\\(Eirini et al., 2017;](#page-9-21) [Manukyan, 2019;](#page-10-21) [Amrutha et al., 2021\\)](#page-9-22). Thus, these metabolite changes are an adaptive response mechanism in trifoliate orange under drought stress. The results of the present study showed that AMF inoculation significantly inhibited the relative concentrations of various differential metabolites in almost all cases, except for β-caryophyllene which was increased. [Bernardo et al. \\(2019\\)](#page-9-4) also reported the increase of two terpenoids (a limonene-1,2 doil and (20S)-ginsenoside Rh2) and the reduction of another terpenoids (7-deoxyloganate and hemigossypol-6-methyl ether) in wheat plants under drought stress after the colonization by *F*. *mosseae*. We speculated that mycorrhizal plants possessed more biomass including roots than non-mycorrhizal plants, so there was a dilution effect, which led to the decrease in differential metabolites. Additionally, mycorrhizal fungi may have promoted effects on the amount of volatilization and release of terpenoids under drought conditions. Many terpenes are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and a small number of studies also displayed that mycorrhizal fungal colonization increased the emission of the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate from *Plantago lanceolata* [\\(Fontana et al., 2009](#page-9-15)) and the emission of limonene and artemisia ketone from *Artemisia annua* [\\(Rapparini et al., 2007](#page-10-11)). The emission of these terpenoids is almost comparable to the mechanical damage and herbivore damage to plants. These suggest that mycorrhiza-induced reduction of terpenoids may lead to an increased emission of VOCs. VOCs are an indirect way for plants to attract natural enemies to defend against insect herbivores as well as for VOCs to play a signal to initiate plant defense response ([Fontana](#page-9-15)  [et al., 2009\\)](#page-9-15). More work needs to be carried out around the changes in the emission of VOCs by mycorrhizal versus non-mycorrhizal plants under adversity. Our results also displayed that AMF inoculation significantly reduced the relative concentration of phytol in roots of trifoliate orange under drought stress, but not under well-watered. In fact, in the process of abiotic stress, a certain amount of chlorophyll is disintegrated, leading to a substantial accumulation of free phytol [\\(Podda et al., 2019](#page-10-20)). [Zhang et al. \\(2020\\)](#page-10-22) also found significantly higher chlorophyll levels in drought-stressed trifoliate orange after inoculation with *F*. *mosseae*. This implies that mycorrhizal plants have a higher chlorophyll content and therefore reduced phytol levels under drought conditions. It concludes that mycorrhizal plants under drought stress are characterized with a low level of chlorophyll degradation and thus maintain a relatively high accumulation of photosynthates, which is positive for the drought tolerance of plants.

21,TA042860,10.3390/ijms23094771,Quantification and Improvement of the Dynamics of Human Serum Albumin andGlycated Human Serum Albumin with Astaxanthin/Astaxanthin-Metal Ion Complexes:Physico-Chemical and Computational Approaches.,"Glycated human serum albumin (gHSA) undergoes conformational changes andunfolding events caused by free radicals. The glycation process results in areduced ability of albumin to act as an endogenous scavenger and transporterprotein in diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) patients. Astaxanthin (ASX) in nativeform and complexed with metal ions (Cu(2+) and Zn(2+)) has been shown to preventgHSA from experiencing unfolding events. Furthermore, it improves proteinstability of gHSA and human serum albumin (HSA) as it is shown through moleculardynamics studies. In this study, the ASX/ASX-metal ion complexes were reactedwith both HSA/gHSA and analyzed with electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR)spectroscopy, rheology and zeta sizer (particle size and zeta potential)analysis, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectrophotometermeasurements, as well as molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and moleculardocking calculations. The addition of metal ions to ASX improves its ability toact as an antioxidant and both ASX or ASX-metal ion complexes maintain HSA andgHSA stability while performing their functions.","Wibowo, Syahputra, Costa, Jessica, Baratto, Maria Camilla, Pogni, Rebecca, Widyarti, Sri, Sabarudin, Akhmad, Matsuo, Koichi, Sumitro, Sutiman Bambang",2022,International journal of molecular sciences,2,False,False,True,"The accumulation of oxidative stress in biological systems causes a variety of health issues in humans. Oxidative stress is caused by free radicals that exceed the defense capacity of human cells. One of the oxidative effects generated by free radicals is a change in albumin protein structure in type 2 diabetic patients. Albumin is a protein that is immediately influenced by an increase in blood free radicals. This problem impairs albumin’s ability to serve as a scavenger and transporter. One of albumin’s functions, as a scavenger, is metal ion binding; as previously stated, heme possesses pro-oxidant qualities, and albumin is an effective protein in heme binding. When heme is linked with albumin, the pro-oxidant characteristics decrease, indicating that albumin functions as an antioxidant. Albumin has also been shown to bind numerous metal ions such as Cu2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Fe3+ and Mn3+ with active residues as Cys34. The oxidative stress target in albumin is site 2, and it is also shown that modification or removal of cysteine residue will expose human serum albumin (HSA) to be easily degraded. Our previous studies showed that glycated human serum albumin (gHSA) had an unfolding event in molecular dynamic simulation within 15,000 ps. The unfolding also causes the detachment of side chains A and B in gHSA. Changes in albumin’s secondary structure have an influence on blood rheology on a larger scale. One of the most important aspects of blood rheology is viscosity. Internal friction causes viscosity change, which is a measure of flow resistance. Blood viscosity is higher in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients due to red blood cell aggregation and impaired deformability. Microangiopathy and macroangiopathy are two types of blood vessel narrowing caused by diabetes. Slower blood and erythrocyte flow result from a combination of capillary shrinkage and increased blood viscosity. Antioxidants are required by the body of T2DM patients to counteract protein unfolding and preserve the stability of proteins damaged by free radicals. Antioxidants play a critical function in electron balance under oxidative stress situations. This is because antioxidants may serve as both donors and acceptors of electrons. ASX, one of the lipophilic terpene substances with a polyene chain, is one of the carotene group’s antioxidants with a strong potential as an antioxidant. Free radicals can be stabilized by this chain. As a radical scavenger, ASX employs a number of reactions, including radical adduct, hydrogen atom transfer and single electron transfer. ASX treatment in gHSA and HSA has previously been proven to maintain protein structure until the endpoint of molecular dynamics simulation. The finding is confirmed by data from the backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) and movie visualization. ASX is a carotenoid which can interact with a wide range of systems. ASX has two adjacent oxygen atoms in the form of hydroxyl groups and a keto group on the cyclohexane ring. Due to the existence of this oxygen atoms, ASX molecules can coordinate metal ions. The structure of cyclohexane is similar to hydroxyl quinones, which have high biological activity, including the formation of chelation complexes with transition metal ions. Density functional theory analysis and molecular dynamic simulations showed that ASX, in the complex form with transition metal ions such as Cu2+ and Zn2+, has greater antioxidant capacity than ASX in the not complexed form.In this research, the capacity of ASX and ASX-metal ion complexed with gHSA and HSA acting as antioxidants at different doses has been investigated. There has never been any research on the management of diabetes mellitus from the standpoint of albumin and ASX, as well as ASX-metal ions. Furthermore, CD spectroscopy has been used for time dependent investigation to monitor changes in the secondary structure of HSA and gHSA following interaction with astaxanthin. New data are also shown for antioxidant activity determination by EPR spectroscopy, rheology measurements, UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis, particle size and zeta potential studies, as well as in silico approach. The purpose of this research is to determine the ability of the ASX and ASX-metal ions in maintaining protein structure as well as reduce viscosity levels in both gHSA and HSA.","Astaxanthin (SML0982, CAS No 472-61-7), human serum albumin (HSA) and glycated human serum albumin (gHSA), CuCl2·2H2O, ZnCl2, absolute ethanol, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich.Astaxanthin stock solution was obtained by dissolving 10 mg in 100 mL ethanol (0.167 mM). After, solutions with different astaxanthin concentrations, as native (6 × 10−11 mM) and as metal complexes with Cu2+ (1 μM and 3 μM) and Zn2+ (1 μM, 3 μM and 20 μM), were prepared. These concentrations are based on the properties, previously determined, for the preparation of ASX and ASX-metal ion complexes. The Cu2+ stock solution was prepared with CuCl2·2H2O (6.814 mg) in 20 mL aqueous solution and then used as a working solution with a concentration of 1 and 2 μM. Zn2+ was prepared by dissolving ZnCl2 (54.52 mg) in 20 mL of aqueous solution, then diluted into working solutions with concentrations of 1, 2 and 20 μM. For the complex formation, the following conditions were used: stirrer time (5 min for ASX-Cu and 15 min for ASX-Zn), temperature (351 K) and complex molar ratio of (astaxanthin:metal ions) both for Cu2+ and Zn2+ (1:1, 1:2 and 3:1). Temperature control was carried out on a water bath placed on top of magnetic stirrers (Cimarec Thermom SP-88850105) at a speed of 110 rpm.HSA (33.2 mg) and gHSA (16.6 mg) were dissolved in 100 and 50 mL PBS (5 µM), respectively, and diluted to 1 µM concentration. ASX–protein complex was made by incubating samples with temperature conditioning (280 K) in a dark environment on a shaking incubator at a speed of 110 rpm for 7 days. Sample codes are 1 (HSA 1 μM), 2 (gHSA 1 μM), 3 (gHSA-ASX 3 μM), 4 (HSA-ASX 3 μM), 5 (gHSA-ASX 20 μM), 6 (HSA-ASX 20 μM), 7 (gHSA-ASX 6 × 10−11 mM), 8 (HSA-ASX 6 × 10−11 mM), 9 (gHSA-ASX 1 μM), 10 (HSA-ASX 1 μM), 11 (gHSA-ASXCu (1:1) μM), 12 (HSA-ASXCu (1:1) μM), 13 (gHSA-ASXCu (1:2) μM), 14 (HSA-ASXCu (1:2) μM), 15 (gHSA-ASXCu (3:1) μM), 16 (HSA-ASXCu (3:1) μM), 17 (gHSA-ASXZn (1:1) μM), 18 (HSA-ASXZn (1:1) μM), 19 (gHSA-ASXZn (1:2) μM), 20 (HSA-ASXZn (1:2) μM), 21 (gHSA-ASXZn (3:1) μM), 22 (HSA-ASXZn (3:1) μM), 23 (gHSA-ASXZn (20:20) μM) and 24 (HSA-ASXZn (20:20) μM).The UV-Vis experiments were performed using a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer Lambda 900/Perkin Elmer Instruments (Norwalk, CT, USA). Each sample of ASX was reviewed for UV-Vis spectrum profile with a wavelength of 190–790 nm meanwhile for HSA, gHSA and complexes in 190–690 nm range, using a survey mode (accuracy of 5 nm). The spectrophotometer calibration was performed using absolute ethanol and PBS for ASX and ASX–protein complexes, respectively.Measurements were performed by using the simple capillary tube viscometer method at Klinik Bromo, Malang. All the samples were obtained in sets of three and averaged. A 2 mL reservoir was located on the upper section of the viscometer. It was filled vertically with fluid sample to the reservoir’s upper line, and the free flow time of the sample to the reservoir’s lower line was measured in seconds (s). The value obtained by comparing the free flow time of a sample to the free flow time of distilled water, which is 1, is referred to as “relative viscosity”. The viscometer was used in the same vertical position and without direct sunlight or airflow under the designated constant laboratory conditions. To make the statistical and graphic estimates more accurate, free flow time instead of relative viscosity value was used.The spectropolarimeter used was a J-815 model (Jasco). Samples were placed in quartz cells with a size of 0.1 cm. The spectral range, 190–250 nm, was used. The temperature was 298 K, with a response time of 2 s and a scanning speed of 20 nm/min in continuous scanning mode. The sensitivity was standard (100 mdeg), and the data pitch and band width were 0.1 nm and 1 nm, respectively. Data were accumulated three times. Time dependent analysis was divided into 5 days: day 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 (incubation time of samples). For the analysis of the CD data, the spectrum of the PBS buffer was subtracted for all complexes. PBS was used as protein solvent. The data were then computationally processed using a web server for secondary structure analysis, specifically BeStSel (Beta Structure Selection) in (bestsel.elte.hu/index.php).The zeta potential and particle size analysis of each sample were measured with a Zetasizer Nano-ZS90 (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) using laser doppler micro-electrophoresis technique. For this purpose, 17 samples, each in triplicate, were prepared in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated in the dark at 310 K for 7 days prior to analyses: HSA (1 μM), gHSA (1 μM), ASX (6 × 10−11 mM), HSA + ASX, gHSA + ASX, ASX-Cu2+, ASX-Zn2+, ASX 3 μM, ASX 20 μM, (ASX-Cu2+) + HSA, (ASX-Cu2+) + gHSA, (ASX-Zn2+) + HSA, (ASX-Zn2+) + gHSA, (ASX 3 μM) + HSA, (ASX 3 μM) + gHSA, (ASX 20 μM) + HSA, and (ASX 20 μM) + gHSA. Selection of ASX sample concentration (6 × 10−11 mM) was based on viscosity results, which showed high stability in performing functions to reduce blood viscosity in gHSA. Meanwhile, based on our previous research, the concentration of astaxanthin with metal ions was chosen as follows: ASX-Cu (3:1), T = 351 K, 5 min and ASX-Zn (1:1), T = 351 K, 15 min. The operating temperature was set at 298 K and 100 consecutive runs were collected for each sample.EPR measurements were performed with a Bruker E580 Elexsys Series spectrometer (Bruker Biospin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany), operating at X- band (ν = 9 GHz) and equipped with a Bruker high sensitivity ER4122SHQE cavity.For antioxidant analysis, the 2,2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was chosen. DPPH (0.1 mM) reacted with both ASX and ASX-metal ions with a final concentration of 0.25 µM. The incubation time was 30 min and experiments were performed in ethanol at T = 298 K. After the spectra acquisition of DPPH radical signal in absence and presence of ASX and ASX-metal ions, the double integral of each spectrum was calculated and the scavenger activity percentage was determined using the following formula: where A0 represents the double integral of the DPPH radical without the addition of the antioxidant, Aa corresponds to the double integral of the DPPH radical after the addition of antioxidant.Meanwhile, because Cu2+ is a paramagnetic metal ion and Zn2+ is not, the EPR spectra have been recorded to check the complex formation between ASX and Cu2+ metal ion. The samples were prepared in a 1 mm ID quartz capillary tube and then were placed inside standard Suprasil EPR tubes. The low temperature spectra were recorded using the Bruker ER 4111VT variable temperature unit. All samples were analyzed at low temperature (130 K) using liquid nitrogen.The ASX and ASX-metal ion complexes were created in the Avogadro program by input of the isomeric SMILES of ASX and then adding Zn2+ and Cu2+. A setup force field (UFF), a 500-step method, and an algorithm (Steepest Descent) to optimize the geometry were also used. All computations were carried out using the TD-DFT software Gaussian09 and GaussView 6.0. For frequency analysis and optimization, the Ground State approach was utilized, with the LANL2DZ basis set and B3LYP density functional. The LANL2DZ basis set was chosen because it fits the requirements for TD-DFT calculations on the interaction of metal ions such as cadmium and zinc.PubChem ( accessed on 1 July 2021) and PDB ( accessed on 1 July 2021) databases were used for data mining. The compounds used were ASX (5,281,224), hexose (206), Zn2+ (32,051) and Cu2+ (27,099). The ASX-metal ion complexes were divided into three, which were ASX-M2+, ASX-2M2+ and 3ASX-M2+. Meanwhile, HSA with PDB ID (4K2C). The ASX and ASX-metal ions were prepared in the Open Babel software by changing the format (.sdf) to (.pdbqt), after which the HSA protein was cleaned of ligand and water using the Discovery Studio 2016 Client and stored in (.pdb) format. AutoDock Vina, that is included in the PyRx 0.8 package, was used for docking. Autodock Vina was selected as it adopts more accurate binding poses than Autodock 4 which are in line with the research objective, namely supporting the results for the wet lab research data with in silico data. All docking operations with dimensions: X (90.1439), Y (109.1736), and Z (79.3440) are covered by the Vina search box, while the center of the box uses X (11.5350), Y (−23.336), and Z (5.6978).","Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by a variation in albumin protein structure caused by oxidative stress. In this context, the interaction between gHSA/HSA and a strong antioxidant compound as ASX, was evaluated. Furthermore, to increase the complex capacity and the antioxidant activity of astaxanthin, the addition of metal ions such as Cu2+ and Zn2+ was studied.In Figure 1A the UV-Vis spectra of HSA (black line) and gHSA (red line) are reported. Comparing the spectra of HSA and gHSA, an increase in absorbance was observed for the latter.The increase in the absorbance peak of gHSA was attributed to the change in the secondary structure of the protein due to the formation of Amadori product occurring between glycation agents with the HSA lysines. In Figure 1B, the UV-Vis spectra of ASX dissolved in EtOH at different concentrations, with the absorbance peak at 486 nm, is reported. Furthermore, in Figure 1C the UV-Vis spectra of HSA/gHSA-ASX complexes have been carried out. The presence of the peak at 486 nm is due to the presence of free astaxanthin which is not present in samples 7 and 8 (see the inset in Figure 1C). The UV-Vis analysis, performed in the presence of ASX and ASX metal complexes with HSA and gHSA, show the absence of free astaxanthin (see Figure 1D,E). This points out that the presence of metal ions favors a complete complexation of ASX with the protein. Furthermore, in all the spectra of HSA and gHSA complexed with ASX and ASX-metal ions, an absorbance decrease in the region of 200 nm was observed compared to the free forms, due to the conformational change of the protein. These results confirm the complexation of ASX and ASX-metal ions with HSA/gHSA. Previous studies on the bovine serum albumin (BSA) complex for reaction with different antioxidants reported similar results. A decrease in the absorbance peak, when the antioxidants were complexed with glycated albumin, was detected. The decrease in absorbance values is also supported by CD data, where a change in the secondary structure of the protein was observed during incubation time.EPR spectroscopy has been applied to investigate the Cu2+ complexation ability of ASX, gHSA-ASX-Cu and HSA-ASX-Cu as well as the antioxidant activity through the in vitro assay of 2,2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH).In Figure 2A, low-temperature (150 K) EPR spectra of ASX-Cu in the 1:1, 1:2 and 3:1 molar ratios are reported. The figure shows the typical line shape of Cu2+-complexes in an axial geometry with defined parallel and perpendicular regions. These data confirm the ability of ASX to complex copper ion. From the analysis of the parallel region of the EPR spectra, the presence of the two copper isotopes is evident, due to the slight splitting of the single lines. For all the spectra, the inhomogeneous broadening of the lines and the experimental magnetic parameters, g║ = 2.425 ± 0.002 and A║ = 11.0 ± 0.2 mT, are typical for copper complexes with 4O atoms in the coordination sphere, as it is also confirmed by the Blumberg and Peisach diagram. The assignment of Cu–O bonds in the EPR spectra is in agreement with a previous study on UV-Vis and FTIR of ASX-metal ions complex.In Figure 2B, low-temperature (150 K) EPR spectra of HSA+ASX-Cu and gHSA+ASX-Cu in the molar ratios 1:1, 1:2 and 3:1 are reported. The figure shows the typical line shape of Cu2+-complexes in an axial geometry, but the presence of coordinated nitrogen atoms cannot be ruled out. It is evident from the broadening of the parallel components of the spectra compared with the ones reported in Figure 2A. The magnetic parameters for these spectra are g║ = 2.363 ± 0.002 and A║ = 15.4 ± 0.2 mT supporting a 1N3O coordination. For comparison, the EPR spectra of Cu2+ with HSA and gHSA were recorded (Figure S1 red and blue lines respectively) showing the complexation ability of the protein. These EPR data clearly show that stable complexes can be formed by the interaction of ASX-Cu with HSA and gHSA at all the tested molar ratios. This result strongly supports the initial theory and results for CD analysis that the addition of ASX and ASX-metal ions, in this case Cu2+, can maintain the stability of HSA and gHSA proteins. The same findings, regarding the ability of albumin to bind Cu2+, were also investigated by Sciortino et al.. In prion proteins (PrPc), complexes with Cu2+ are also found in the “octarepeat” regions and show the same pattern when Cu2+ binds to the N-terminal of the protein.The antioxidant activity of ASX and ASX-metal ions was tested by EPR using the DPPH assay (Figure 3). In Figure 3 the percentage of the scavenging activity of ASX and ASX plus metal ions Cu2+ or Zn2+ at different molar ratios is reported. In the inset, the room temperature EPR spectrum of the DPPH radical is shown. It is characterised by five lines due to the hyperfine interaction of the unpaired electron with the two magnetically equivalent N atoms present in the structure.The figure shows that at the same concentration of 0.5 μM, free astaxanthin has a scavenging activity of 4.8% compared to 62.9% of ASX-Cu complex (3:1) and 55.2% of ASX-Zn (1:2). It was found that the ratio (3:1) is the optimal concentration for ASX-Cu complex showing the higher percentage of scavenging activity when compared to the other ratios. This is in agreement with Marin et al., who demonstrated that the addition of metal ions to ASX increased its antioxidant activity.As a ketocarotenoid, ASX with the structural formula C40H52O4 has a molar mass of 596.84 g/mol. This compound has two terminal rings joined by a polyene chain with either single or double bonds. There are various types of ASX, including the stereoisomeric form, esterified form (both hydroxyl groups react with fatty acids), geometric isomer and free form. ASX has two asymmetric carbon atoms in the 3,3 positions of the β-ionone ring as well as -OH (hydroxyl) functional groups on both ends of the molecule. Natural sources contain all of these forms, with the stereoisomeric forms (3S, 3′S) and (3R, 3′R) being the most prevalent. Unlike other carotenoids, both rings are oxygenated, with polyene chains double-bound as a backbone, boosting ASX’s antioxidant capabilities.MEP is a critical metric for determining the reactivity of an approaching electrophile towards a compound active center (where the electron distribution effect is most prominent). MEP analysis is important because it represents molecular size structure and charges of a compound. The MEP data are highly valuable in the research of molecular structure and its physico-chemical property relationship. MEP analysis was carried out for astaxanthin and astaxanthin in the presence of Cu2+ and Zn2+. A change in electrostatic properties was observed. In Figure 4, the maximum negative region, which is the preferred site for the electrophilic attack, is indicated in red as the majority of MEP, whereas the maximum positive region, which is the major site for the nucleophilic attack, is indicated in blue. The energy range of astaxanthin was −7.385 × 10−2/7.385 × 10−2/characterized by nucleophilic regions (red zone) in correspondence of oxygens. In presence of Zn2+, the energy range of astaxanthin moves to −0.253 × 100 /0.253 × 100 due to the electrophilic regions (blue zone) near the zinc. Meanwhile, in presence of Cu2+ the nucleophilic regions are observed in correspondence of copper and the energy range of complexed astaxanthin increased to −9.526 × 10−2 /9.526 × 10−2. The alteration of astaxanthin structure in the presence of metal ions was also revealed in our previous study. The transition from trans to cis conformation was observed in the complexes of astaxanthin with metal ions. This cis modification could improve astaxanthin’s antioxidant capabilities. These results support the best scavenging activity shown by the ASX-metal ion complexes obtained with DPPH test by EPR spectroscopy.CD-spectroscopy was used to investigate the changes in the protein secondary structure of HSA and gHSA with or without ASX and ASX-metal ions in different molar ratios. Their stability was checked during the 7 days of incubation. In several studies, this method was used to determine the structural changes in proteins during glycation such as protein instability and α-helix modifications. In Figure 5, the CD spectra of HSA and gHSA with or without ASX and ASX-metal ions incubated at different times are reported. The CD spectra of albumin protein exhibits two negative bands at 209 and 222 nm, characteristic of the alpha-helix structure. In Figure 6, the percentage of protein secondary structure for all samples analyzed at D-0 and D-7 are shown. The blue and pink bars indicate the α-helical and random coils content, respectively.A lower delta epsilon value, and therefore an increase in alpha-helix content was observed for gHSA (red line) compared with native HSA (black line) at D-0 (Figure 5). Furthermore, increasing the incubation time, the α-helix percentage in HSA increased from 48% (D-0) to 55.4% (D-7), close to the α-helix content in gHSA, which is 57% (D-0) (Figure 6). The CD data, recorded at D-1, D-3 and D-5 are reported in the Supplementary Materials (Figures S2 and S3). These findings are in agreement with the results reported by Sattarahmady et al. and Raghav et al., where α-helix in gHSA was higher than HSA, with a decrease in β-sheet conformation, an increase in mean residual ellipticity, and random coil structures.The complexation of proteins with ASX and ASX-metal ions led to a lowering in the α-helical content, caused by the new bonds. Furthermore, depending on the molar ratio and the concentration of ASX and ASX-metal ions, an increase in protein stability was observed. The best result for ASX was for gHSA-ASX 20 μM (sample 5), where a decrease of 1.7% of α-helix from D-0 to D-7 was observed (Figure 6). For the complex ASX-Cu, the best molar ratio was 3:1. A variation in α-helical content of 1.8 and 1.3% for gHSA-ASXCu (3:1) (sample 15) and HSA-ASXCu (3:1) (sample 16), respectively, was found. For ASX-Zn, the 1:2 and 1:1 were the best ratios to maintain α-helical content from gHSA to normal HSA values. In general, the addition of ASX and ASX-metal ions had a stability impact, especially on glycated albumin, by maintaining the secondary protein structure close to the initial conditions such as normal albumin. The stabilization of albumin proteins, especially for gHSA, was also confirmed by an increase in random coils in all samples (Figure 6 pink bar). Yang et al. showed that the addition of AGuIX®, which is a nanoparticle-based cancer therapy drug, had also the same effect, namely the increase in others/random coils in HSA after drug administration increased the stability of human serum albumin protein. It can be concluded that ASX and ASX-metal ions have a positive impact on the stabilization of albumin proteins, especially on gHSA. These results are in line with molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory carried out in our previous studies, where ASX-metal ions prevented protein unfolding better than native state ASX.Many complications in DMT2 patients are related to increases in the blood viscosity. To allow albumin to work properly, viscosity should be decreased, especially for gHSA. In this context, viscosity analysis was performed for HSA and gHSA in the presence of ASX and ASX-metal ions. The viscosity analysis showed a viscosity reduction in gHSA due to the presence of ASX and ASX complex with Cu2+ and Zn2+ (Figure 7). An important role was played by the concentration of ASX, because ASX in little concentration reduced the viscosity of HSA and gHSA of 34% and 8%, respectively, while higher concentrations (3 and 20 μM) affected viscosity of gHSA, increasing to 144.80% and 154.25%. Adding metal ions such as Cu2+ and Zn2+, the viscosity of gHSA decreased while the viscosity value for HSA increased. ASX-Cu2+ (3:1) complexed with gHSA for 7 days showed a decrease in viscosity of 27.22%. Meanwhile, for ASX-Zn2+ (20 µM:20 µM) as much as 25% of complex compound (1.5 mL (ASX-Zn2+) + 4.5 mL PBS) was able to reduce gHSA viscosity by 19.38%. In conclusion, ASX at low concentration (6 × 10−11 mM) could be used to reduce the viscosity of HSA; but considering that for DMT2 patients, a decrease in the viscosity of gHSA is essential, the use of ASX-metal ions could be relevant.The particle size analysis (Table 1) shows the increase in size for gHSA and HSA proteins complexed with astaxanthin, due to the formation of aggregates in the form of fibrils A higher zeta potential value in gHSA (−14.6 mV) has been found compared to normal HSA (−10.0 mV). This happened because arginine and lysine residues were major sites for glycation. When this modification occurred, it was followed by an increase in negative charge and a decrease in the isoelectric point of the protein. A higher hydrophobicity for the glycated protein due to protein conformational changes, including partial unfolding, will result. Then, when HSA and gHSA were complexed with ASX, the zeta potential value for the two proteins was smaller, namely HSA-ASX (−2.88 mV) and gHSA-ASX (−4.82 mV). However, when compared with the ASX-metal ion complexes, the ability of ASX in energy stabilization was better, especially for gHSA, where for ASX-Cu2+ (−8.58 mV) and ASX-Zn2+ (−10.1 mV).The main objective of zeta potential analysis is to detect a lower zeta potential while retaining a good conductivity value in the chemical complex of ASX with gHSA. The decrease in zeta potential value was also followed by an increase in conductivity where gHSA + ASX (5.58 mS/cm), gHSA + ASX (5.11 mS/cm) and gHSA + ASX (3.35 mS/cm) became 7.61 mS/cm (gHSA + ASX-Zn) and 6.58 mS/cm (gHSA + ASX-Cu). This shows that metal ions-ASX complex is able to provide a better protective effect than native ASX on the protein albumin structure. This is supported by the study of Hang Ma et al. where gBSA before treatment had a zeta potential value of −106.3 mV and when given PGG (gallotannin) decreased to −30.9 mV. The data showed decreased zeta potential for all ASX and ASX-metal ions + HSA/gHSA complexes. However, when compared to ASX, ASX-metal ions perform much better in terms of maintaining conductivity in the sample, so we can conclude from zeta potential and conductivity data that the addition of metal ions to ASX can improve astaxanthin’s ability to carry out energy stabilization in the HSA or gHSA complexes.The glycated albumin model used in this study has hexose (206) as a glycation agent, which is different from previously used glucose (5793). The results for the molecular docking (Figure 8 and Figure 9) showed a slight difference in the binding site of ASX and ASX-metal ion complexes towards albumin when compared with previous studies. When glucose is used as glycation agent, ASX and ASX-metal ions were uniformly bound to site B on gHSA. In all cases, the ASX and ASX-metal ions binding was not competitive with amino acid residues at the glucose binding site. Whereas both ASX and ASX-metal ions will be bound to the A site.Then, the consistency of the binding site (Figure 10) then only occurred at a few concentrations. This is because different glycation agents also cause different folding effects. Binding location for glycation using hexose is still at site B of the albumin HSA protein, namely B:GLN196 (unfavorable bond), B:SER192 (conventional hydrogen bond) and B:GLU153 (conventional hydrogen bond). While for glucose as a glycation agent, the unfavorable bond is at residue B:GLN459 and conventional hydrogen bond at B:SER193, B:ARG145 and B:ASP108.From binding energy, we can conclude that ASX-metal ions are still better than ASX when binding into HSA, HSA+ASX (−8.6 kcal/mol), meanwhile HSA+ASX-Cu (3:1) (−11.2 kcal/mol) and HSA+ASX-Zn (3:1) is −10.4 kcal/mol. These findings support all the data for UV-Vis, CD-spectra, antioxidant activity by EPR, viscosity as well as zeta potential. Both ASX and ASX-metal ions interact more strongly with gHSA than HSA complex. Where in gHSA, ASX has a binding energy of −9.1 kcal/mol, while in HSA, it is −8.6 kcal/mol. Likewise, the addition of metal ions Cu2+ and Zn2+ can increase the binding energy of ASX in gHSA protein.However, in ASX-Zn (1:1), the bond energy was found to be lower than ASX, when viewed from the ASX-Zn data with a 1:1 ratio with a concentration of 1 μM:1 μM, it is still able to maintain the secondary structure of HSA and gHSA until the 7th day of incubation. For concentration (20 μM:20 μM) (1:1), the CD-spectra pattern for HSA and gHSA is still the same, but drastic changes occurred in the secondary structure. This is because there are unfavorable bonds in the gHSA + ASX-Zn (1:1) complex in the amino acid residues A:ARG218 and A:LYS199 and the concentration used is most likely higher than the protein concentration (1 μM). Data docking also supports scavenging activity of astaxanthin where ASX-Zn (1:2) which has the lowest binding energy towards gHSA (−9.6 kcal/mol) and better scavenging activity 55.2% compared to ASX alone. The same trend is also shown by ASX-Cu (3:1) with the lowest binding energy of −11.6 kcal/mol and the largest scavenging activity of 62.9% (Figure 3 and Figure 9). The lower the binding energy, the better the interaction with the target protein.",,"For the first time ever, EPR data were obtained reporting the complexation of ASX with metal ion (Cu2+). Its relationship with HSA and gHSA, as well as the ability of ASX/ASX-metal ions (Cu2+ and Zn2+) as antioxidants, showed by 2,2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and MEP analysis, was reported. With the addition of ASX/ASX-metal ions, the ability of gHSA (an essential marker in T2DM patients) as a transporter and endogenous scavenger improved protein rheology, decreasing viscosity and zeta potential close to normal albumin values. CD spectroscopy also confirmed that ASX and ASX-metal ion complexes prevent damage to gHSA by maintaining the stability of the secondary structures from D-0 until D-7. It was also observed that ASX-metal ions improved the stability of gHSA more than ASX alone. The docking data confirm that the best binding energy is for ASX-Cu2+ (3:1) and ASX-Zn2+ (1:2); it is also in line with the antioxidant data and CD spectroscopy, which show that the above ratios are the best in maintaining the stability of albumin protein, both native and glycated. Overall, adding metal ions to astaxanthin increase astaxanthin’s ability as an antioxidant and help to maintain the stability of HSA and gHSA in carrying out its functions."

Meyer (Araliaceae) has cardioprotective effects.Ginsenosides are responsible for most of the pharmacological activities ofginseng. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effect of ginsenoside Rg2 onmyocardial fibrosis in myocardial ischaemia rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MaleWistar rats were divided into control, isoproterenol, ginsenoside Rg2 (5,20 mg/kg) groups (n = 8). The rats were subcutaneously injected withisoproterenol (5 mg/kg) or normal saline (control group) once daily for 7 days.The animals were intragastrically treated with ginsenoside Rg2 or 0.5% CMC-Na(control and isoproterenol groups) daily for 28 days. At day 28, cardiacfunction, myocardial fibrosis, and TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway were evaluated.RESULTS: Compared with myocardial ischaemic rats, ginsenoside Rg2 at doses of 5,20 mg/kg abated partially the augment of LVEDP (8.9 ± 1.3 vs. 7.5 ± 0.7,7.2 ± 1.0 mmHg) and the decreases of the LVSP (96.75 ± 13.2 vs. 118.3 ± 19.4,124.3 ± 21.3 mmHg), the + dp/dt (2142.8 ± 309.3 vs. 2598.6 ± 404.0,2661.5 ± 445.2 mmHg/s), and the -dp/dt (1996.3 ± 306.3 vs. 2476.6 ± 289.7,2509.6 ± 353.1 mmHg/s). Ginsenoside Rg2 (9.2 ± 0.9%, 8.5 ± 0.8%) alleviatedmyocardial fibrosis when compared with the isoproterenol group (10.1 ± 1.0%),which was accompanied by suppressed TGF-β1/Smad signalling in heart tissues.CONCLUSIONS: Ginsenosides from ginseng possess the property of alleviatingmyocardial fibrosis, improving cardiac function after myocardial ischaemia.Ginsenosides may be promising agents for improving the outcomes of patients withmyocardial ischaemia.","Wang, Quanwei, Fu, Wenwen, Yu, Xiaofeng, Xu, Huali, Sui, Dayun, Wang, Yeling",2021,Pharmaceutical biology,2,False,False,True,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the primary cause of death worldwide (Hausenloy and Yellon). Myocardial ischaemia, the most common CVDs, is caused by the reduction in coronary blood flow due to atherosclerotic coronary arterial obstruction. Researchers find that surgical approaches restoring blood flow of coronary arteries fail to improve cardiac function of patients with myocardial ischaemia (Ngu et al.). On average, myocardial fibrosis will occur in 10% of patients. Myocardial fibrosis is the common cause of death after myocardial ischaemia, which accounts for a higher 5-year mortality (about 50%) (Benjamin et al.). Myocardial fibrosis is characterised by the collagen formation, which leads to a chamber stiffness and an increased myocardial mass (Li et al.). Tremendous efforts have been made to develop therapeutics to attenuate myocardial fibrosis and improve cardiac function in patients of myocardial ischaemia. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and small-molecule drugs are promising agents for preventing myocardial ischaemia-induced heart function impairment (Hashimoto et al.).In China, TCM has been used in treating CVDs for thousands of years. A great deal of interest has focussed on elucidating the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effects of the active ingredients of TCM (Fan et al.). Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Araliaceae), a well-known TCM, is widely used for increasing vital energy and improving organ functions. Ginsenosides are the major active ingredients of ginseng. According to the structures of the extracted components of ginseng, ginsenosides are classified into three groups: the panaxadiol group including Rb1, Rb2, Rg3, and Rh2, the panaxatriol group including Re, Rh1, and Rg1, and oleanolic acid (Zhang et al.). Recent work demonstrates that ginsenoside Rb1 can reduce the injury of myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion and then improve the heart function by inhibiting the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes (Li et al.). Ginsenoside Rg1 exerts a protective effect against myocardial ischaemia-induced injury, which is associated with modulating energy metabolism and inhibiting myocardial apoptosis (Li et al.). Our previous studies indicate that ginsenoside Re treatment abrogates the myocardial fibrosis caused by myocardial ischaemia and then restores the heart function (Wang et al.). Ginsenoside Rg2 is one of the cardinal components of ginseng. Ginsenoside Rg2 has a property of attenuating the neuronal damage induced by hypoxia in hippocampal neurons (Shuangyan et al.). Ginsenoside Rg2 can also improve cerebral ischaemia-induced dementia through abating the apoptosis of neurons (Zhang et al.). However, it is still not clear whether ginsenoside Rg2 has a protective effect against myocardial ischaemic injury. Therefore, this study investigates whether ginsenoside Rg2 could alleviate myocardial ischaemia-induced myocardial fibrosis and cardiac function impairment in rats.","Ginsenoside Rg2 extracted from ginseng cultivated in China was kindly provided by Professor Yifa Zhou (School of Life Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China). The purity of ginsenoside Rg2 was >98.0%.Male Wistar rats weighing 240–260 g were obtained from the Experiment Animal Centre of Jilin University (Changchun, China). Animals were housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle at a controlled temperature and humidity with unlimited access to food and water. The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Jilin University (Approval number, JLU2018-03-0023) and were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (publication 86-23, revised in 1986).Experiment 1: Rats were randomly divided into two groups (n = 8): a control group (1 rat was excluded because of anaesthetic overdose) and a ginsenoside Rg2 at dose of 20 mg/kg group. The rats of the control group were intragastrically administered with 0.5% CMC-Na daily for 28 days. The animals of the ginsenoside Rg2 groups were intragastrically treated with ginsenoside Rg2 daily for 28 days. Experiment 2: Rats were randomly divided into four groups (n =8): a control group, an isoproterenol group and ginsenoside Rg2 (5, 20 mg/kg) groups. To induce myocardial fibrosis, the rats were injected subcutaneously with isoproterenol (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at a dose of 5 mg/kg, once daily for 7 consecutive days (Zhang et al.). Two hours later, the animals in the ginsenoside Rg2 groups were intragastrically treated with ginsenoside Rg2 at doses of 5 or 20 mg/kg, daily for 28 days. The rats of the control and the isoproterenol groups were intragastrically administered with 0.5% CMC-Na daily for 28 days.At day 28, the body weights of the rats were recorded. The rats were anaesthetised by an intraperitoneal injection with a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). A 2 F polyethylene catheter was inserted into the left ventricle through the right common carotid artery. The catheter was connected with a hemodynamic analysing system (Model RM-6000, Nihon Kohden, Japan). Then, the left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and positive (+dp/dt) and negative (-dp/dt) maximal values of the first derivative of the left ventricular pressure were evaluated.The rats were sacrificed with overdoses of carbon dioxide after cardiac function evaluation. The hearts of the animals were collected and washed with PBS solution (4 °C). The aorta, atria, and adipose tissue were excised. Heart weights were weighed and heart weight index (mg/g) was calculated by dividing heart weight by body weight.The hearts of the rats were fixed with 10% formalin for 24 h. The specimens were embedded with paraffin and then were cut into 5 μm thick sections. According to the instruction of the manufacturer, the heart sections were stained with a Sirius red staining kit (Solarbio Life Sciences Company, China). Then, the histopathological examination was conducted by an experienced observer who was blinded to the experimental design under an Olympus microscope (IX-70, Olympus Corp., Japan). Ten fields were randomly selected from five sections in each heart. The ratio of the interstitial fibrosis area in the hearts was analysed and calculated with NIH-Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.). The myocardial fibrosis was presented by the calculation: (fibrotic tissue area)/(fibrotic tissue area + cardiomyocyte area) × 100%.Western blot was performed as previously described (Ahn et al.). The membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies: rabbit anti-TGF-β1 (1:1000, Proteintech, USA), rabbit anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (1:2000, ImmunoWay Biotechnology, USA), rabbit anti-collagen I (1:2000, Abcam, UK), rabbit anti-Smad3 (1:1500, Abcam, UK), rabbit anti-p-Smad3 (1:1500, Abcam, UK) or rabbit anti-β-actin (1:1500, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were processed with the horseradish peroxidase-labelled secondary antibody (1:2000, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). The bands were visualised using the ECL detection reagents (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). The ratio of the density of bands of the detected protein to that of β-actin was used for statistical analysis.Data were presented as the mean ± SD and processed with SPSS 22.0. Statistical analysis among various groups was conducted by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc test. The p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.","Compared with the control group, the LVSP, the LVEDP, the + dp/dt, and the -dp/dt of ginsenoside Rg2 group did not show significant changes (Figure 1, p > 0.05). Further histopathological examination demonstrated that myocardial fibrosis in the ginsenoside Rg2 group was the same as that of the control group (Figure 2, p > 0.05). These findings indicated that ginsenoside Rg2 alone had no effect on the cardiac function and the myocardial fibrosis in normal rats.The cardiac function of the rats was evaluated with a hemodynamic analysing system. The LVEDP of the rats in the isoproterenol group was significantly increased, as compared with the control group (p < 0.01). The LVSP, the + dp/dt, and the –dp/dt in the isoproterenol group were markedly decreased (p < 0.01). Compared with the isoproterenol group, LVEDP of the rats in the ginsenoside Rg2 groups was significantly decreased, whereas the LVSP, the + dp/dt, and the –dp/dt of the ginsenoside Rg2 groups were increased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). These results demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg2 has a property improving the cardiac function in myocardial ischaemic rats (Figure 3).The gross morphological examination showed that hearts of the rats from the isoproterenol group were significantly larger than those from the control group (Figure 4(A)). In addition, heart weight and heart weight index were significantly increased in the isoproterenol group when compared to the control group (p < 0.01). Treatment with ginsenoside Rg2 at doses of 5, 20 mg/kg abrogated partially myocardial ischaemia-induced increases of heart weight and heart weight index (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, Figure 4(B–D)).The Sirius red staining showed that there was extensive collagen deposition in the border zone of the myocardial ischaemia in the myocardial ischaemic rats, whereas treatment with ginsenoside Rg2 at doses of 5, 20 mg/kg markedly reduced contents of collagen deposition in myocardial ischaemic rats (Figure 5(A)). The red-stained area was calculated as a percentage of the total area with Image-Pro Plus software. In line with the observations mentioned above, the red-appearing collagens of the heart tissues in myocardial ischaemic animals were significantly augmented (p < 0.01). However, ginsenoside Rg2 treatment markedly decreased the contents of the collagen content in the heart tissues (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, Figure 5(B)).TGF-β1 leads to the production of collagens in myocardial fibroblasts. Smad3 is the downstream effectors of the TGF-β1 receptor. The effects of ginsenoside Rg2 on the TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway in the heart tissues were investigated in the present study. The results showed that expression of TGF-β1, p-Smad3, collagen I and α-SMA were significantly up-regulated in the heart tissues of myocardial ischaemic rats (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). However, treatment with ginsenoside Rg2 significantly decreased the expression of TGF-β1, p-Smad3, collagen I and α-SMA in the heart tissues (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, Figure 6(A–D).","Cardiomyocytes death during myocardial ischaemia leads to a multiphase reparative response. The damaged heart tissues are replaced by a fibrotic scar produced by myofibroblasts. The progression of ischaemic necrosis induces interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in heart ventricular wall. The interstitial fibrosis and focal replacement scars can prevent cardiac rupture which is a fatal complication of myocardial ischaemia. However, the progressive myocardial fibrosis is detrimental as it produces abnormalities in ventricular function and leads to heart failure (Prabhu and Frangogiannis). Therefore, attenuating myocardial fibrosis would offer a favourable prognosis in patients with ischaemic heart disease. The present study demonstrated for the first time ginsenoside Rg2 alone did not induce myocardial fibrosis and had no adverse effect on cardiac function. Ginsenoside Rg2 showed a property of alleviating the myocardial fibrosis and improving the impairment of cardiac function by regulating the TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway after myocardial ischaemia.Myocardial ischaemia causes the changes in the size, shape, and function of the heart and leads to cardiac failure. It is well known that the heart has no capacity of regeneration, and the lost cardiomyocytes will be replaced by a fibrotic scar (Laflamme and Murry). The fibrotic process after myocardial ischaemia is classified into replacement and reactive fibrosis, both of which are associated with myofibroblasts (Gao et al.). The characteristic of myofibroblasts is the expression of α-SMA. Therefore, the content of α-SMA is a commonly used to evaluate the myofibroblasts in heart tissues (Shinde et al.). Collagen I is the primary structural protein in the heart interstitium and is synthesised by myofibroblasts (van den Borne et al.). Myofibroblasts secrete a great deal of interstitial collagens after myocardial ischaemia, which is crucial for increasing heart weight and impairing cardiac function. The current study showed that cardiac function was impaired after myocardial ischaemia and there were significant depositions of collagen I in the heart tissues. However, treatment with ginsenoside Rg2 for 28 days improved cardiac function and decreased collagen I depositions, suggesting that ginsenoside Rg2 can ameliorate ischaemia-induced myocardial fibrosis.Numerous factors play a role in modulating the fibrosis induced by myocardial ischaemia. TGF-β1 is the cardinal pro-fibrotic growth factor involved in fibroblast activation and collagens production (Dobaczewski et al.). The previous report demonstrates that TGF-β1 leads to the transdifferentiation of myofibroblast and therefore increases the synthesis of extracellular matrix protein (Dobaczewski et al.). In hearts, TGF-β1 will be rapidly produced and released in response to ischaemia. TGF-β1 exerts its effects through binding to its receptor and induces phosphorylation of Smads. Smad3 is one of the major downstream regulators that are associated with TGF-β1-mediated myocardial fibrosis. The phosphorylation of Smad3 forms heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and then they translocate into the nucleus. In the nucleus, the complex regulates the expression of target genes related to fibrosis (e.g., collagen I) after binding to the Smad-binding element (Shi and Massagué). In this study, we found that the expression of collagen I in the myocardial ischaemic rat hearts was increased. Also, expressions of TGF-β1 and p-Smad3 were augmented, suggesting that the TGF-β1/Smad3 signalling pathway was involved in the process of myocardial fibrosis. Consistent with our hypothesis, ginsenoside Rg2 reduced expressions of TGF-β1, p-Smad3, and collagen I. These findings suggested that ginsenoside Rg2 alleviates myocardial fibrosis and therefore improves the impairment of cardiac function by regulating TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway after myocardial ischaemia.",The present experiments demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg2 possesses the property of alleviating myocardial fibrosis and improving cardiac function by regulating the TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway after myocardial ischaemia. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of ginseng in the clinical application for myocardial ischaemia.Changchun is at 125.35 degrees East longitude and 43.88 degrees North latitude.
23,TA040677,10.1038/s41598-023-40098-5,Mechanisms governing the impact of nitrogen stress on the formation of secondarymetabolites in Artemisia argyi leaves.,"Nitrogen is a key factor in various physiological and metabolic processes inplants. Providing an adequate supply of nitrogen is essential for improving thetotal yield and quality of the medicinal plant Artemisia argyi (A. argyi), butthe underlying mechanisms of how this nutrient alters the crop remains unclear.In this study, we conducted a series of pot experiments to investigate theagronomic traits and active components in the leaves of A. argyi plants under lowand high nitrogen stress. Additionally, we used transcriptome analysis andRT-qPCR to explore the molecular pathways associated with nitrogen stress. Ourresults demonstrate a dramatic increase in the accumulation of phenolic acids andflavonoids in the low nitrogen (LN) stress group compared to the control (CK),with increases of 40.00% and 79.49%, respectively. Interestingly, plants in thehigh nitrogen (HN) stress group exhibited enhanced plant growth with largerleaves, thicker stems, and a 3% increase in volatile oil content compared to theCK. Moreover, A. argyi in the HN group displayed a 66% increase in volatile oilconcentration compared to the LN group. Our combined transcriptome and q-PCRresults indicate that LN stress promotes the expression of genes involved inflavonoid synthesis, while HN stress promotes the expression of genes related toterpene skeleton production and photosynthesis. Taken together, these findingssuggest that different gene expression levels under LN and HN stress contributeto the photosynthesis capacity and the accumulation of active ingredients in A.argyi leaves. Our results elucidate the physiological and molecular mechanisms ofnitrogen stress on A. argyi secondary metabolites and guide fertilizationstrategies for plant cultivation.","Wang, Zixin, Zhao, Tingting, Ma, Lin, Chen, Changjie, Miao, Yuhuan, Guo, Lanping, Liu, Dahui",2023,Scientific reports,2,True,True,True,"Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development as it represents a major component of various proteins, nucleic acids, enzymes, chlorophyll, vitamins, and hormones. The element plays a significant role in many aspects of a plant’s life, including the accumulation of secondary metabolites, growth and development, and productive yield. Its involvement in the synthesis of organic osmoregulatory substances and subsequent metabolism is crucial for enhancing plant physiology and agronomy. For instance, a previous study demonstrated how nitrogen fertilizer application can significantly increase rice yield.Increasing soil nitrogen fertilization leads to a decrease in the non-structural carbohydrate content in plants, subsequently reducing the prevalence of monoterpenes that utilize these carbohydrates as substrates for synthesis. Modulating the level of nitrogen in the soil can be an effective method for altering plant chemistry and increasing the amount of volatile oils. However, as soil nitrogen increases, so does the amount of secondary compounds that use amino acids as precursors.The distinct effects of nitrogen fertilizer on plant flavonoid content may be attributed to the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis (CNB), which states that plant growth is more constrained under nitrogen stress than during photosynthesis, necessitating an increase in secondary metabolites for antioxidant accumulation. Previous studies have demonstrated that excessive nitrogen leads to flavonoid decreases in ginkgo, apple, and buckwheat. This decrease may be attributed to the reduced activity of the phenylalanine synthetic enzyme activity, which is crucial for the production of flavonoid secondary metabolites. In the presence of excess nitrogen, this enzyme exhibits diminished activity, thereby affecting the synthesis of free flavonoids. Previous studies in medicinal plants have demonstrated that a reduction of this enzyme induced by high nitrogen levels leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of some phenolic acids like chlorogenic acid. Similarly, studies have shown that low nitrogen can increase the supply of total phenols in medicinal plants such as Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Malaysian Kacip Fatimah, and nettle, allowing for the increased formation of phenolic compounds.Artemisia argyi (Artemisia argyi Levi. et Vant), commonly known as Chinese mugwort or silvery wormwood, is an edible herb belonging to the Asteraceae family with traditional uses in medicine. The shrubby perennial is well known for its ability to stop bleeding, regulate menstrual flow, alleviate cold symptoms, and reduce pain. It contains a variety of volatile oils, flavonoids, polysaccharides, and many other valuable active ingredients. In traditional Chinese medicine, a practice known as moxibustion uses the burning of the plant to externally treat or prevent diseases. Extracts are also commonly made from the leaves of A. argyi for use as a supplement called wormwood. Both chemical and organic fertilizers can be used in A.argyi cultivation to induce thicker stems, larger leaves, and higher extract yields. A.argyi leaves grown in Herb Spring, located in the Hubei Province of China, exhibit nearly double the yield of volatile oil compared to plants from other locations. This characteristic not only enhances their medicinal properties but also increases their economic value.As an essential nutrient for growth and development, nitrogen can be effectively used to increase the yield and quality of medicinal plants. The majority of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems exists as atmospheric nitrogen, or N2, a gas that cannot be directly absorbed and used by plants. Bioavailable nitrogen is scarce, leading to restrictions in plant growth and production, significantly influencing the structure and functions of ecosystems. To overcome the lack of naturally occurring nitrogen, modern growers frequently supplement their soils with fertilizers to maintain and improve crop yields. However, excessive nitrogen can reduce plant disease resistance, hindering the capacity for the accumulation of active ingredients in medicinal plants. The excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer can also increase soil caking and other potentially serious environmental consequences. Hence, it is crucial to determine the dosage of nitrogen fertilizer that will maximize the quantity and quality of A. argyi leaves without contaminating the surrounding ecosystems.In this study, we hypothesized that varying degrees of nitrogen stress affect agronomic traits and the contents of active ingredients in A. argyi leaves by regulating related genes and metabolic pathways. This study aims to provide a better understanding of the molecular effects of nitrogen on A. argyi from a genetic and metabolic perspective.","The pot experiments were conducted from January to June 2021 at the Medicinal Plant Garden of Hubei University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (30° 27′ N, 114° 15′ E). Each pot was filled with 8 kg of soil with 2 kg sand added to improve ventilation. The soil was yellow–brown and contained the following basic physical and chemical properties: pH, 5.92; organic matter, 2.6 g kg–1; total nitrogen, 0.4 g kg–1; available nitrogen, 21.4 mg kg–1; available phosphorus, 2.6 mg kg–1; and available potassium, 60.7 mg kg–1. Three herbaceous A. argyi rhizomes obtained from Qichun County in Hubei Province of China were planted in each pot in January 2021 at a depth of 3 cm. The quantities of nitrogen in each treatment were based on the Ma et al. nitrogen fertilization field trial of A. argyi in Qichun, Hubei. The treatments contained 0.5 (LN), 2 (CK), and 4 (HN) g∙10 kg−1 of nitrogen and were applied three times in total. The first application was the largest and consisted of 60% of the total fertilizer applied in January 2021. The remaining 40% was divided into two separate applications on March 23 and April 11. Additionally, we applied 1.5 g∙10 kg−1 of P2O5 and 2 g∙10 kg−1 of K2O to each treatment and added 10 mL of an Arnon trace element mixture (Ca(NO3)2 945 mg/L, K2SO4 607 mg/L, NH4H2PO4 115 mg/L, and Mg2SO4 493 mg/L) to each basin to supplement trace nutrients. After determining the emergence rate, the plants were thinned to four plants per pot and routinely managed. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.The emergence rate of A. argyi plants was investigated on March 2, 2021. Agronomic traits including plant height, stem diameter, dead leaf height, leaf number, five-leaf spacing, leaf width, leaf length, and chlorophyll content were measured on June 8, 2021. The chlorophyll content was measured with a chlorophyll meter (SPAD-502PLUS; Minolta, Tokyo, Japan). The plants were then harvested and dried in the shade. The total dry weight of A. argyi leaves and stems in each pot was measured and divided to calculate the weight per plant.A total of 10 g of dry leaves from every each pot were used for the wormwood extraction. Each sample was placed on a high-speed universal pulverizer (OAK, China) with a rotating speed of 28,000 r·min−1 for 30 s. The crushed mixture was then placed into a 2 mm sieve to remove the powder, leaving only the wormwood extract. The wormwood output rate was calculated as the ratio of wormwood to dry leaf.The leaves of A. argyi plants grown under each nitrogen treatment were harvested, dried in the shade, and crushed. The quantity of P was measured using the vanadium molybdate blue colorimetric method, and K, Mg, Ca, and Zn were measured using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. N was measured using the Kjeldahl method.The content of volatile oil was determined according to the methods described in the general rule 2204 of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Volume IV), 2020 edition. Volatile components were identified using the following steps: weigh 0.3 g of fresh A. argyi leaves; grind the leaves; place the product into a 20 mL headspace bottle of a solid-phase microextraction instrument; insert the manual sampler of pdms-dvb extraction fiber head (Supelco, USA) into the bottle; balance at 85℃ for 10 min; push out the extraction head; empty the extract for 40 min; remove the extract and immediately insert it into the sample inlet of the chromatograph; and desorb for 3 min. The conditions of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Thermo Scientific, USA) were determined based on a previous study by Chen et al.. The Mainlib library was used to search for each chromatographic peak in the total ion flow diagram of volatile oil by GC–MS. The chromatographic peaks with a probability > 50% were selected for further analysis.The total phenolic acid and flavonoid content in fresh A. argyi leaves were determined according to Estévez et al.. Extracts from each sample were collected through the ultrasonication of 0.2 g (passed through a 40-mesh sieve) of leaf tissue combined with 50 mL of 60% methanol for 40 min. The resulting extract was then filtered and utilized for the quantification of total phenols and total flavonoids. To determine the total flavonoids, 2 mL of the sample extract was transferred into a 25 mL flask and combined with 5 mL of distilled water and 1 mL of 5% NaNO2 solution. The contents were shaken for 6 min to ensure a thorough mixture. Next, 1 mL of 10% Al(NO3)3 solution was added and sitting for an additional 6 min. The solution was then mixed with 10 mL of 4% NaOH and the final volume was adjusted to the 25 mL mark by adding distilled water. The sample was allowed to stand at room temperature for 45 min before being measured for absorbance at 509 nm using rutin as the standard. Total phenols contents were measured by adding 1 mL of the sample extract into a 25 mL brown flask with 11 mL of distilled water, followed by 1 mL of Florinol reagent. The contents were mixed for 1 min and 20% NaCO3 solution was added until the mark 25 mL mark was reached. The mixture was shaken well and allowed to stand for 50 min before being measured for absorbance at 750 nm using gallic acid as the standard. The Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) was used for all HPLC analyses. The phenolic acids and flavonoids were separated using the ZORBAXRRHD Eclipse Plus 95A C18 column (2.1 9 100 mm, 1.8 lm, Agilent) and detected at 330 nm by UV. The mobile phases were acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% phosphoric acid (B) with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The separation gradient conditions were as follows: 0–0.5 min, 2–5% A; 0.5–7 min, 5–25% A; 711 min, 25–33% A; 11–14 min, 30–33% A; 14–19.5 min, 33– 45% A; 19.5–20.5 min, 45–85% A; 20.5–27 min, 85–98% A; 27–28 min, and 98–2% A.The total RNA of leaves from each A. argyi sample was isolated using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with three biological replicates. cDNA libraries were constructed using 5 μg of RNA per sample and sequenced using the Novaseq 6000 platform. After data filtering, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome using the HISAT 2.2.4 and the Bowtie2 programs. The reference genome can be found at https://iris.angers.inra.fr/gddh13/index.html. The fragment per kilobase transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values for each transcribed area were calculated using the RESM program. A fold change > 2 and a divergence probability < 0.8 were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the DESeq2 software. The screening criteria of differentially expressed genes were |log2FC|≥ 1.00 using an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05. Enrichment analysis was performed using annotations from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO).A. argyi genes involved in photosynthesis and the synthesis of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and terpenes in leaves were selected for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) detection. The primers used for this analysis are listed in Table S1. Total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the ACTIN gene (5′-CGACTATGTTCCCTGGTATTGC-3′ and 5′-AGACCCTCCGATCCAGACACT-3′) as the internal reference. The primers were designed using the NCBI primer designing tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index.cgi?LINK_LOC=BlastHome). The RT-qPCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 Instrument II and a tiangen real universal Color Premix (SYBR green). The 2ΔΔCT method was used to calculate the relative expressions of each gene. A total of three biological replicates were used for each sample.Data processing and mapping were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.00 software. All data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Each treatment was represented by at least three biological replicates. One-way ANOVA and LSD (Least Significant Difference) tests were carried out using the SPSS 20.0 statistical software. Regression models were established to estimate curvatures and Pearson’s correlation coefficient, was conducted using SPSS 20.0 software.","In this study, pot experiments were conducted to explore the effects of low (LN) and high (HN) nitrogen stress on agronomic traits and the accumulation of effective components in A. argyi. A. argyi plants were divided into three groups, each of which was treated with a different dosage of nitrogen fertilizer (LN 0.5 g/10 kg, CK 2 g/10 kg, HN 4 g/10 kg). Our results show that compared to the control group (CK), plants in the HN group displayed greener leaves, while plants in the LN group showed symptoms of nitrogen deficiency with yellow-green leaves and short stature (Fig. 1). We also found that both LN and HN treatment groups showed a decreased germination compared to the CK (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the CK group represented the largest plant height, dry plant height, dry stem height, and output of wormwood (Fig. 2B,I,K,H). The stem diameter, number of blades, leaf width, leaf length, and chlorophyll content were highest in the HN group (Fig. 2C,D,E,F,G), however, it showed a decrease in five-leaf spacing (Fig. 2J). Additionally, both the CK and HN groups showed significantly increased leaf weights, stem dry weights, and wormwood output rates compared to the LN group, with the highest output rate in the CK (Fig. 2J,K,L). Taken together, these results demonstrate that nitrogen fertilizer promotes the growth, development, and wormwood output rate of A. argyi leaves.Previous research has demonstrated that barley plants undergoing HN stress contain higher levels of other crucial elements (P, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Mn). Here, we analyzed the quantities of various elements in A. argyi leaves treated with differing levels of nitrogen and found that the HN group contained the highest nitrogen (1.98%) but the lowest K content (1.67%); the CK group contained the highest P content (0.157%); and the LN group contained the highest K content (2.50%). Additionally, in the LN, CK, and HN groups, the Mg content was 0.17, 0.31, and 0.19 mg/g; the Cu content was 6.45, 7.33, and 4.77 mg/kg; and the Zn content was 155.19, 170.76, and 170.24 mg/kg, respectively. The N and Ca levels were highest in the HN group, whereas the P, Mg, Cu, and Zn levels peaked in the CK group. The K content decreased most dramatically under HN stress (Fig. 3).Volatile oils, flavonoids, and phenolic acids are important secondary metabolic components in A. argyi. To explore the effects of nitrogen application on the accumulation of volatile elements, we determined the total volatile oil and volatile components in A. argyi leaves under LN, CK, and HN treatments. Compared to the LN group, we observed a 60.56% and 64.79% increase in volatile oil content in the CK and HN groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in oil content between the CK and HN groups (Fig. 4A). A more detailed analysis of the volatile substances revealed a drop in the relative percentage of eucalyptol from 12.86% to 23.12% in the CK and HN groups compared to LN. There was no significant difference in the relative percentage contents of 3, 6-Heptadien-2-ol, 2, 5, 5-trimethyl-, (E)-, (S)-2, 5-dimethyl-3-vinyl hex-4-en-2-ol and p-Mentha-1, 5-dien-8-ol between the LN and CK groups, but there was a significant increase in the HN group. Similarly, the relative percentage of (S)-3, 3, 6-Trimethylhepta-1, 5-dien-4-yl acetate increased significantly with the rise in nitrogen fertilizer application, increasing from 28.47% to 74.31%. Finally, the relative percentage of 1-octen-3-ol and caryophyllene oxide showed no significant changes to the nitrogen treatments (Fig. 4B–H). These results suggest that HN stress promotes the production of total volatile oils, with various volatile components displaying their own distinct trends.Next, we measured the quantities of flavonoids and phenolic acids in A. argyi leaves under differing levels of nitrogen stress. Our results demonstrate that the increase in nitrogen heavily impacted the abundance of flavonoids and phenolic acids in A. argyi plants, decreasing their amounts by 44.02%-74.39% and 28.57%-49.17%, respectively (Fig. 5A,B). Higher levels of nitrogen also led to an initial increase in the amount of eupatilin and hispidlin, but the elevated levels did not persist. Compared to the LN group, the content of jaceosidin rose by 6.82% and 35.58% in the CK and HN groups, respectively (Fig. 5C,D). There was no significant difference in the amount of jaceosidin between treatments (Fig. 5E). The contents of chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid C, isochlorogenic acid A, and isochlorogenic acid B were all highest in the LN treatment (Fig. 5F–K) and lowest in the CK treatment. Together, these results demonstrate that LN stress promotes the accumulation of total phenolic acids and flavonoids.During this study, we observed correlations in A. argyi leaves between seven mineral elements, agronomic traits, and the concentrations of various active ingredients (Fig. 6). In total, we identified 19 positively and 6 negatively correlated traits. We found that N content was positively correlated with leaf number, stem diameter, chlorophyll content, leaf yield, and stem dry weight; P was positively correlated with emerging number, leaf yield, and stalk dry weight; K was negatively correlated with leaf number and chlorophyll content; Cu was positively correlated with withering height; Zn was positively correlated with leaf number and stem thickness; N and K were negatively correlated; and N and Zn were positively correlated.We found significant correlations (correlation coefficients > 0.01) between the active ingredients and the leaf components in 87 trait pairs, 43 of which were positively correlated while the remaining 44 were negatively correlated (Fig. 6). In addition to volatile oil content, N was found to be negatively correlated with total phenolic acid, total flavonoids, neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, and total cryptogenic acid; P was negatively correlated with neochlorogenic acid; and K was positively correlated with all these variables plus caryophyllene oxide and eucalyptol content. Additionally, K elements showed a positive relationship with volatile oil content, total phenolic acid, total flavonoids, caryophyllene oxide, and eucalyptol. Cu was positively correlated with eucalyptol content and negatively correlated with 3,6-Heptadien-2-ol, and egatively correlated with2,5,5-trimethyl-, (E)-, (S)-2,5-Dimethyl-3-vinylhex-4-en-2-ol content. Ca was significantly negatively correlated with eucalyptol content.We also noted both antagonistic and synergistic interactions among the seven analyzed elements. Combined, these results elucidate the interaction between the uptake and transport of mineral elements in A. argyi leaves undergoing different N treatments.Next, we performed transcriptomic analyses on A. argyi leaves to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which nitrogen fertilizers affect plant growth and quality. We identified a total of 2,883 DEGs in leaves under LN stress compared to the CK group. These DEGs are comprised of 1,623 up-regulated genes and 1,260 down-regulated genes. In the HN group, we found that 265 genes were up-regulated and 282 genes were down-regulated compared to the CK group.Because different stresses have a significant impact on the amount of secondary metabolites in Artemisia argyi leaves, we focused our functional localization on the production pathways of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoids in order to further characterize the effects of nitrogen stress on the synthesis pathways of major A. argyi secondary metabolites. We carried out functional and pathway analyses using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (http://www.genome.jp/kaas-bin/kaas_main?mode=est_b;22), theseidentified genes were subjected to KEGG enrichment analysis (Fig. 7). We first investigated the DEGs under LN stress compared to the CK group. Of the up-regulated DEGs, 15 were enriched in ""flavonoid biosynthesis"", which involves enzymes such as chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), and flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H). An additional 30 genes were enriched in ""phenylpropane biosynthesis"", which involves enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), and p-Coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL). Of the down-regulated DEGs, 15 were enriched in ""phenylpropane biosynthesis"". Subsequently, we analyzed the identified DEGs in the HN group compared to the CK group. Two of these genes were enriched in the ""terpene skeleton biosynthesis"" pathway, which involves the enzymes such as geranyl diphosphate synthase(GPPS), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS), and terpene synthases (TPS). Four genes enriched in the ""phenylpropane biosynthesis"" pathway were up-regulated, while an additional seven were down-regulated in the same category (Fig. 7). These results demonstrate the effect of nitrogen stress on the biosynthesis of flavonoids and terpenes.Flavonoids and terpenoids are the most important active ingredients in A. argyi leaves. In this study, we compared the gene expressions of these two compound classes in leaves subjected to nitrogen stress and visualized the results using a heat map (Fig. 8). In the flavonoid synthesis pathway, there was a significant decrease in the expressions of AY175438-RA and AY239769-RA, two genes that encode phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1 (PAL) synthesis, in CK and HN groups compared to the LN group.Conversely, AY177432-RA, AY239769-RA, AY067952-RA, and AY058254-RA, which encode for trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (C4H) synthesis, showed the highest expressions under LN stress. Moreover, LN also displayed high expression levels of AY183661-RA and AY1774451-RA, which encode chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), as well as other genes that regulate enzymes required for flavonoid synthesis. The HN group showed higher expression levels of genes related to the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, which is associated with terpene skeleton synthesis (Fig. 8). In this treatment, there were elevated expression levels of AY056270-RA which encodes acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT) synthesis; AY-178405-RA which encodes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR); AY-003519-RA which encodes isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPPI) synthesis; and AY-289049-RA which encodes farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (FPPS) synthesis. The MEP synthesis pathway was more mixed, with 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) encoding genes AY291248-RA, AY236918-RA, and AY001249-RA showing higher expression under LN stress, while AY-078091-RA and AY-028159-RA showed higher expression under HN stress. Finally, HN treatments were also elevated in the expression of AY-076609-RA which encodes 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2, 4-cycloid-phosphate synthase (MDS) synthesis; AY-076609-RA which encodes MDS synthesis; and AY-028715-RA which encodes geranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) synthesis.Next, we verified key genes involved in the synthesis pathways of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and terpene synthesis in A. argyi leaves by RT-qPCR. We found that an increase in nitrogen application significantly decreased the expression levels of AY148678-RA (encoding CHS), AY067952-RA (encoding C4H), and AY177451-RA (encoding CHI) (Fig. 9A,B,C). Similarly, the expression levels of AY028393-RA (encoding F3'H), AY009396-RA (encoding CHS), and AY2633333-RA (encoding CHS) were the lowest under HN (Fig. 9,E,F). The expression of AY028715-RA (encoding GGPPS), AY150191-RA (encoding isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase-IPPI), AY178405-RA (encoding HMGR), and AY078091-RA (encoding DXS) however, were elevated in the HS group (Fig. 9G,H,I,J).Additionally, we quantitatively confirmed the expression of several genes essential for photosynthesis. In the HN group, there was a distinct increase in the expression of key genes AY065247-RA and AY241096-RA, both of which are involved in the photosynthesis pathway. The expression of AY065247-RA was significantly down-regulated under LN stress and up-regulated under HN stress, while the expression of AY241096-RA showed no differences between LN and CK (Fig. 9K,L). AY070796-RA, AY163355-RA, AY175527-RA, and AY241097-RA are all involved in the chloroplast synthesis pathway, and their expression levels were significantly higher in the CK and HN groups compared to the LN group (Fig. 9M,N,O). The expression of AY241097-RA, however, was significantly up-regulated under HN stress (Fig. 9P). These results are consistent with our transcriptomic analyses.","Many previous studies have demonstrated the significant role N plays in sustaining plant development and metabolism. Fertilizers rich in nitrogen are often used by growers to increase crop yields, but their overuse tends to degrade plant quality and leads to secondary soil salinization and energy waste. Hence, it is crucial to determine the ideal amount of supplemental N used in growing operations to ensure a balance between plant quality and the environment.Plants can create amino acids by directly combining the salts of ammonium nitrogen with organic acids created during photosynthetic reactions, which in turn are capable of producing additional nitrogenous organic matter. A. argyi plants are small (Fig. 1) with feeble stalks (Fig. 2C) and yellow leaves (Fig. 1). Our findings reveal that the chlorophyll content (Fig. 2G) in A. argyi leaves significantly increases in higher nitrogen environments, which is consistent with previous research.A.argyi leaves are rich in volatile oils, many of which are extremely important in traditional Chinese medicine. Here, we determined the volatile oil content of A. argyi leaves undergoing various nitrogen treatments and found them to be the lowest in the LN group. There was no significant difference between the CK and HN groups, which may be explained by the effects of nitrogen on growth. Flavanoids are also incredibly important plant components, and previous research has proposed that select flavonoids have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-hypercholesterolemic, and antioxidant properties. To date, > 20 flavonoids, flavanols, and their glycosides have been isolated from A. argyi leaves. In this study, we found that the total flavonoid content in A. argyi leaves decreases with high levels of applied nitrogen. We observed that eupatilin, hispidulin, and jaceosidin were most prevalent in the CK group. We also measured phenolic acid content and found them to be significantly more present in the LN group than in the CK and HN groups. Next, we assessed the synergistic and antagonistic effects of mineral element content with plant growth species and active ingredient content using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Our results showed that N content in A. argyi leaves was significantly positively correlated with photosynthesis and negatively correlated with flavonoid and phenolic acid content. This information provides a reference for future research in determining the effects of N application on metabolic pathways in A. argyi leaves. Our results support the CNB hypothesis which predicts that a higher level of carbon-based secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, are present under limited nitrogen availability. In turn, decreased nitrogen could have accelerated the metabolism of phenylpropanoids, increasing the concentration of total polyphenols in plant tissues. In this study, we identified and analyzed differentially expressed genes enriched under various nitrogen treatments to understand their functional impact. We found several enriched genes associated with the synthesis of phenylalanine, flavonoids, and terpenoid skeletons. Intermediates like PAL and C4H are among the precursors for flavonoid formation. Additionally, CHS/CHI catalyzes the formation of flavanones. Our study shows that an elevated supply of nitrogen decreases the expression of AY-175438RA and AY239769-RA, genes that control the synthesis of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1 (PAL). This contrasts with AY177432-RA and AY239769-RA. Furthermore, we noted that the gene regulating trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (C4H) synthesis is most expressed under LN conditions. Our results show that under LN conditions, there are high expression levels of chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), which catalyzes the formation of flavanones, as well as other genes controlling enzymes in the flavonoid synthesis pathway like AY-067952RA and AY-058254RA.Plant terpenoids are synthesized independently via two major pathways–the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytoplasm, and the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in the plastid. HMGR is an enzyme heavily involved in the MVA pathway, which catalyzes the formation of MVA from HMG-CoA. It is considered to be the first rate-limiting enzyme regulating cytoplasmic terpenoid metabolism. The IPP is a common intermediate in both pathways and can cross the plasma membrane, creating an intersection between the two. DXS is an important rate-limiting enzyme in the DXP pathway, which catalyzes the condensation of pyruvate and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde to form DOXP, leading to the formation of carotenoids, plastoquinones, and chlorophylls. In this study, we identified several genes including AY56270-RA, AY003519-RA, and AY289049-RA, which were highly expressed in the LN treatment and are associated with the MEP synthesis pathway. Genes related to DXS enzyme synthesis like AY291248-RA, AY236918-RA, and AY001249-RA also displayed higher expression levels under LN conditions, while genes with similar functions like AY078091-RA, and AY028159-RA were more highly expressed under HN treatments.In this study, we employed transcriptomic analysis to investigate the regulation of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoid secondary metabolites in A. argyi leaves following the application of varying nitrogen dosages. We also evaluated the regulatory genes associated with the production of enzymes and compared their expression levels between nitrogen treatment groups. Further studies are needed to validate the functions of these related genes and secondary metabolites in A. argyi leaves. Additionally, our research provides guidance for methods to improve plant development, maximize production, and increase active components. We aim to provide growers with pertinent information so they may establish effective and environmentally nitrogen fertilization routines. Our findings also seed to guide sustainable agricultural practices and enhance resource efficiency, benefiting both the environment and the production of A. argyi.",
24,TA047837,10.3727/096504020X15853075736554,Corosolic Acid Inhibits Cancer Progress Through Inactivating YAP inHepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Chemotherapy is critical for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Despite the proapoptotic effects of corosolic acid (CA) treatment, its underlyingmechanism is not completely clear. The aim of this study was to determine themolecular mechanism of CA in HCC treatment. MTT assay was used to determine theIC(50) of CA. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were used to detect theinteraction and subcellular localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP) andmouse double minute 2 (MDM2). In addition, in vivo xenotransplantation wasperformed to assess the effects of CA, YAP, and MDM2 on tumorigenesis. The IC(50)of CA was about 40 M in different HCC cell lines, and CA decreased YAP expressionby reducing its stability and increasing its ubiquitination. CA treatment andMDM2 overexpression significantly decreased the crosstalk between YAP andcAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), TEA domain transcription factor(TEAD), and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). CA stimulation promotedthe translocation of YAP and MDM2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and increasedtheir binding. In addition, CA treatment obviously reduced tumorigenesis, whereasthis effect was abolished when cells were transfected with sh-MDM2 or Vector-YAP.The present study uncovered that CA induced cancer progress repression throughtranslocating YAP from the nucleus in HCC, which might provide a new therapeutictarget for HCC.","Jia, Ming, Xiong, Yulin, Li, Maoshi, Mao, Qing",2020,Oncology research,2,False,False,True,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world. It is currently the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, accounting for approximately 800,000 deaths every year. In general, the clinical treatments for HCC include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and liver transplantation. Among them, surgical resection of tumors and liver transplantation often have a curative effect in patients. However, owing to poor prognoses and high recurrence rates after resection, a large number of patients present with advanced disease and are not eligible for surgery. Although chemotherapy is an alternative choice for advanced HCC, the efficacy of chemotherapy is often hampered by a range of adverse side effects that cause patient suffering and even death. Therefore, it is urgent to focus on the development of more effective therapeutic drugs against HCC with fewer side effects.In recent years, Chinese herbal medicines have been extensively used in various anticancer studies, and a number of them have been shown to have anticancer properties. Compared to Western medicine used at a certain stage of cancer treatment, Chinese herbal medicine always shows less toxicity and is a more efficient treatment, and tumor recurrence and metastasis are less likely. Among these herbal medicines, Actinidia valvata Dunn (Actinidiaceae), a shrub that mainly grows in eastern China, has a series of applications in traditional Chinese medicine and as a folk herb. The root of this plant, commonly known as Mao renshen in China, exhibits notable anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities and has cytotoxic effects against several types of cancer cells, including liver cancer cells. Corosolic acid (CA), which is found in water extracts of Actinidia chinensis, also exhibits significant anticancer effects in HCC cells by decreasing HCC cell migration without cytotoxicity. However, the pharmacological activity of CA remains poorly understood.Cancer cell proliferation is a critical process in tumor development; thus, antiproliferation therapy is an important approach for cancer treatment. The Hippo pathway plays a critical role in controlling organ size by regulating cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP), the downstream effector of the tumor suppressor Hippo pathway, serves as an oncoprotein that significantly contributes to liver tumorigenesis. In addition, YAP acts as a central node that connects the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, p70S6K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and c-Jun/c-Fos signaling pathways and thereby forms a complex network that maintains transformative phenotypes in liver cancer cells, suggesting that molecules that inhibit YAP may be effective therapeutic targets in HCC.In the present study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between CA and YAP and to reveal the mechanism of CA in the inhibition of HCC.","The HCC cell lines Hep3B and HepG2 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). SMMC-7721, Huh7, and HLE cells were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Huh7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco, Boston, MA, USA), Hep3B and HepG2 cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium, and SMMC-7721 and HLE cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco). All the culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. In all experiments, cells were allowed to adhere prior to their exposure to CA (formula: C30H48O4; No. 4547-24-4, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 μM), with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as control. Cells were treated with 10 μM MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich) or 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX; a protein synthesis inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich) to assess the protein degradation manner. To determine the extent of apoptosis in our assays, we collected all fractions and attached and floating cells in the culture supernatant.A plasmid overexpressing mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) (vector-MDM2, No. SC118660) and its negative control vector (vector-NC), as well as the overexpressing lentivirus vector used to upregulate YAP (vector-YAP), were all purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD, USA). The short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) used to downregulate human MDM2 (sh-MDM2) and YAP (sh-YAP) expression were obtained from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). Cells were transfected with vector-MDM2 and vector-NC using INTERFERin® transfection reagent (Polyplus, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, a total of 2 × 105 cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA. The transfection efficiency was detected by Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after 48 or 24 h of transfection, respectively.Cells were extracted in lysis buffer containing 50 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin in 10 mM tris buffer (pH 7.4), and proteinase inhibitor (1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of total protein were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were incubated overnight with monoclonal antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), cleaved caspase 3/9, caspase 3/9, TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD), CREB, Runx2, YAP, p-YAP, MDM2, p53, histone, and tubulin; all were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). The membrane was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline–Tween 20 (TBST) containing 24.2 g of Tris base, 80 g of NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for a total of 1 L. Next, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (Bioworld, St. Louis Park, MN, USA) at 37°C for 1 h. The signals were visualized using a Luminata Crescendo Western horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore).Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RT-PCR was performed to amplify the cDNA using primers specific for MDM2 mRNA (forward: 5′- ACGACAAAGAAAACGCCACA -3′ and reverse: 5′-GTAACTTGATATACACCAGCATCAA-3′), CTGF mRNA (forward: 5′-GTGGAGTATGTACCGACGGC-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCAGGCACAGGTCTTGATGA-3′), ANKRD1 mRNA (forward: 5′-CCTGTGGATGTGCCTACGTT-3′ and reverse: 5′-ACAGGCGATAAGATGCTCCG-3′), and GAPDH mRNA (forward: 5′-ATCATCCCTGCCTCTACTGG-3′ and reverse: 5′-GTCAGGTCCACCACTGACAC-3′). The RNA input was normalized to the level of GAPDH. All reactions were carried out using SYBR Green Mix (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). RT-PCR was carried out using an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Invitrogen). RT-PCR data were analyzed by the 2−ΔΔCt method.Cytoplasm and nuclear fractionation were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In brief, cells were harvested and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) containing 19 g of NaCl, 0.3 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O, and 6 g of Na2HPO4·12H2O for a total of 1 L. The cells were then lysed with the help of NE-PER Nuclear & Cytoplasmic extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation samples were stored at −80°C in preparation for Western blotting detection.To carry out immunoprecipitation (IP), HepG2 cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (control) or CA for 24 h and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4), and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were then sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-YAP antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4°C. The immunocomplexes were then incubated with PureProteome magnetic beads (Millipore) for 1 h at 4°C, washed, eluted with protein sample buffer (Millipore), and analyzed by Western blotting.Cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye after staining the living cells. Briefly, cells were incubated in 100 μl of media in 96-well plates at an initial cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. After 24 h of incubation, different concentrations of CA were added to the cells, and an appropriate volume of drug vehicle was added to untreated cells. After 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of incubation, 10 μl of an MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 3 h. An SDS/isobutanol/HCl solution (100 μl) (10% SDS, 5% isobutanol, and 12 μM HCl) was added to each culture and incubated overnight. Relative cell viability was determined by scanning with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, San Diego, CA, USA) with a 570-nm filter. Cells in five wells per dose were counted in each experiment.HepG2 cells transfected with sh-MDM2, vector-YAP, or the control vectors were collected and seeded on a 6-cm dish at a density of 200 cells for each well. Cells were continually treated with 40 μM CA. Following incubation at 37°C for 14 days, the cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min and were washed with PBS three times.HepG2 cells were seeded into a 6-cm plate and given different treatments. Following 48 h of incubation at 37°C, annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) was added into the cell suspension and incubated for 5 min in the dark. Cell apoptosis was detected by using a flow cytometer (BD FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo 7.6 software.HepG2 cells at 10% confluence were seeded onto small glass coverslips and placed into 24-well plates. After 24 h of culture, CA (40 μM) was applied. The coverslips were then removed, washed with PBS three times, fixed with 100% methanol (−20°C) for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBST three times, and blocked for 1 h with 5% goat serum in PBS. Next, the cells were incubated with anti-Runx2 (1:1,000 dilution; No. #12556; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-CREB (1:500 dilution; No. #9197; Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-TEAD (1:150 dilution; No. ab221367; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) antibodies overnight at 4°C and then incubated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) AF568 (red; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or IgG AF488 (green; Life Technologies) at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. Finally, the cells were treated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:1 × 104) for 5 min, followed by being washed three times with PBST and covered with antifade mounting medium (Vectashield, Loerrach, Germany) and placed onto microscope slides. The slides were examined under a laser scanning microscope (TCS-SP2-AOBS-MP; Leica Microsystems CMS, Wetzlar, Germany).This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University). All surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Six-week-old female nude mice weighing 20–22 g were subcutaneously injected in the right armpit region with 1 × 107 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS. After xenografts were visible (10 days after injection), the mice were treated with CA (10 mg/kg) for another 28 days before the tumor sizes were measured, and equal DMSO was used as a negative control. Four groups of mice (n = 6/group) were tested. Group 1 (control) mice were injected with HepG2 cells infected with negative control (vector-NC and sh-NC) and treated with DMSO; group 2 mice (CA) were injected with HepG2 cells infected with negative control and treated with CA; group 3 mice (CA + vector-YAP) were injected with HepG2 cells infected with vector-YAP and treated with CA, and group 4 (CA + sh-MDM2) mice were injected with HepG2 cells infected with shRNA-MDM2 and treated with CA.All data were analyzed by SPSS 23.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The significance of the differences between the means of the treated and untreated groups was compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by unpaired Student’s t-test, and a value of p < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.","To determine the IC50 value of CA, we treated SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, and HLE cells with serial concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 μM) of CA. Figure 1A showed the chemical structure of CA. The IC50 of CA in SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, and HLE were 41.2, 40.2, 40.5, 40, and 41.3 μM, respectively (Fig. 1B–F). In addition, 40 μM CA treatment induced significant increases in the levels of cleaved caspase 3/caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9/caspase 9 (Fig. 1G–K). Therefore, we chose 40 μM CA for the next experiments.We next explored the underlying mechanism of CA in the progression of HCC. YAP expression was significantly reduced, while its phosphorylation level (p-YAP) was increased when HepG2, Huh7, and Hep3B cells were treated with 40 μM CA for 24 h compared to the control group (Fig. 2A–C). Next, we evaluated how CA regulated YAP expression in HCC cells. CA treatment significantly enhanced the ubiquitination of YAP protein compared to that of the control group (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we found that treatment with CA in HepG2 cells shortened the half-life of YAP compared to that measured in the control group (Fig. 2E). Together, these results suggested that stimulation with CA inhibited YAP activation.As shown in Figure 3A, CA treatment translocated YAP protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. As the pro-oncogenic role of YAP is controlled by its transcription target, such as CREB, Runx2, and TEAD, we tested whether CA controls YAP via modulating the binding of YAP to CREB, Runx2, and TEAD. Treatment with CA triggered YAP protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and reduced its binding to CREB, Runx2, and TEAD, as shown by the immunofluorescence (Fig. 3B–D) and IP results (Fig. 3E). These results indicated that stimulation with CA inhibited HCC development through inactivating YAP signaling.A previous study reported that YAP bound to MDM2 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of 14-3-3ζ. Accordingly, we explored the effect of MDM2 on CA-induced YAP ubiquitination. Compared with the control group, CA treatment significantly increased the expression of MDM2 protein, with no obvious influence in p53 expression in HepG2, Huh7, and p53-null Hep3B cells (Fig. 4A–C). We then explored MDM2 roles in the interactions between YAP and CREB, Runx2, and TEAD proteins in HepG2 cells. The expression of MDM2 was significantly elevated when HepG2 cells were transfected with vector-MDM2, as detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting assays (Fig. 4D). The IP result demonstrated that MDM2 overexpression significantly weakened the binding of YAP protein to CREB, Runx2, and TEAD in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, compared with the control group, the expressions of CTGF and ANKRD1, downstream genes of YAP signaling, were also decreased when cells were transfected with vector-MDM2 (Fig. 4F). These data illustrated that stimulation with CA decreased YAP expression via increasing MDM2 in HCC cells.We then further revealed the role of MDM2 in stimulation with CA-induced YAP expression decrease. The expression level of MDM2, which bound to YAP protein, was increased when HepG2 cells were treated with CA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Compared with the control group, CA treatment significantly increased the contents of MDM2 and YAP in cytoplasm, while reducing their expression levels in nuclear, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5B–D) and immunofluorescence technology (Fig. 5E). In addition, we explored the role of MDM2 in CA-induced nuclear exportation of YAP protein. MDM2 expression was significantly decreased when HepG2 cells were transfected with sh-MDM2 compared with the sh-NC group (Fig. 5F). Knockdown of MDM2 increased YAP expression and decreased its ubiquitination (Fig. 5G). Moreover, downregulation of MDM2 significantly abolished CA’s role in the translocation of YAP protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. 5H and I). These results suggested that CA treatment inhibited the activation of YAP in a MDM2-dependent manner.Finally, we investigated the effect of the MDM2/YAP axis in CA-induced inhibition of HCC progression. Cell transfection with vector-YAP or sh-MDM2 significantly impaired CA-induced YAP expression repression (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the inhibitions of cell colony formation (Fig. 6B) and proliferation (Fig. 6C) induced by CA treatment were obviously neutralized when HepG2 cells were transfected with sh-vector-YAP or sh-MDM2, as well as the promotion of cell apoptosis induced by CA (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, CA administration significantly reduced in vivo tumor growth, whereas this effect was significantly impaired when cells were transfected with vector-YAP or sh-MDM2 (Fig. 6E–G). The above results illustrated that CA treatment repressed HCC progression via downregulating YAP expression and upregulating MDM2 expression.","The use of Chinese herbal medicine in cancer treatment, either alone or in conjunction with Western medicine, shows much promise in both the laboratory and the clinic. A previous study indicated that CA displayed anticancer activities in vitro and in vivo in the treatment of HCC cells. Specifically, CA stimulation exhibited antimigratory activity and antitumor effects in a xenograft model. Similarly, the present study also demonstrated the antitumor role of CA in HCC, which inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenesis and promoted cell apoptosis through translocating YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. These results indicate that CA could be a potential chemotherapeutic agent for HCC therapy.CA is a ursane-type triterpenoid that inhibits STAT3 in macrophages, myeloid cells, and ovarian cancer cells. CA also significantly inhibits endothelial angiogenic tube formation and tumor growth in lung, ovarian, and liver cancer cells. We also observed that CA had an anticancer effect in SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, and HLE cells. CA at concentrations between 0 and 10 μM was not cytotoxic to cells, and the IC50 of CA was about 40 μM. CA was reported to play an antitumor role largely due to its promotion of apoptosis, which inhibited cell viability in both a dose- and a time-dependent manner and triggered the activation of caspase 8, caspase 9, and caspase 3 in human cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells. Therefore, we focused on apoptosis in the present study. Our results were consistent with these findings and demonstrated that CA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, and HLE cells in a dose-dependent manner.YAP, a transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway, plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and organ development. The function of YAP is associated with a series of transcription factors including the TEAD family, and their interactions activate the transcription of genes such as Runx2 and CREB that control transformative phenotypes in cancer cells. The TEAD–YAP complex not only is frequently hyperactive in breast cancer but also exhibits strong oncogenic activity in liver cancer. YAP can also associate with Runx2 and control downstream Runx2 signaling cascades. Additionally, Wang et al. reported that the YAP–CREB interaction was critical for liver cancer cell survival and the maintenance of transformative phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Both CREB and YAP are highly expressed in a subset of human liver cancer samples and are closely correlated. CREB promotes YAP transcriptional output through binding to −608/−439, a novel region in the YAP promoter. In contrast, YAP promotes the stabilization of CREB through its interaction with mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14/p38) and beta-transducin repeat-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (BTRC). Here we observed that CA decreased YAP stability though accelerating its ubiquitination and reducing the binding of YAP with CREB, TEAD, and Runx2. CA treatment reduced the binding of YAP to TEAD, possibly because CA translocated YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.It is well documented that the YAP-induced promotion of cell proliferation and survival is determined by its nuclear translocation. Our study demonstrated that CA could translocate YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which explains the inhibition of proliferation and promotion of apoptosis by CA. Moreover, the current study demonstrated that CA translocated MDM2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm before YAP. MDM2 was originally identified as a gene that was overexpressed in a spontaneously transformed mouse cell line (3T3-DM), and its gene product was found to transform normal cells. MDM2 overexpression is clinically correlated with metastasis, drug resistance, and the poor prognosis of liver cancer. However, the present study demonstrated that the upregulation of MDM2 reduced the expression of CREB, TEAD, and Runx2 and their binding with YAP as well as the decreased expression of the transcriptional regulators ankyrin repeat domain 1 (ANKRD1) and CTGF. CTGF, cyclin D1, and ANKRD1 are target genes of YAP that promote its induction of growth. ANKRD1 played an antiapoptotic role in mice cardiomyocytes by inducing the expression of Bax.As MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, we speculated that CA promoted the ubiquitination of YAP through promoting its combination with MDM2 and accelerating the degradation of YAP. As expected, the IP assay showed that the ubiquitination level of YAP protein was significantly decreased when MDM2 was downregulated in HCC cells. In addition, the downregulation of MDM2 impaired the translocation of YAP from the nucleus and increased the tumorigenesis of HepG2 cells under CA administration, suggesting that CA-induced YAP translocation from the nucleus and tumorigenesis inhibition require the presence of MDM2. Moreover, it has been reported that there are interactions between p53 and YAP. The wild-type p53 is usually associated with the suppression of YAP oncogenic activity, while mutant p53 differently interacts with YAP. MDM2 is established to inhibit tumor suppressor p53, suggesting that MDM2 might play an oncogenic role via downregulating p53 expression. In the current study, we detected the effects of CA treatment on the expression of p53, and the results showed that CA treatment had no significant influence in the expression level of p53 protein in HepG2, Huh7, and p53-null Hep3B cells. However, CA treatment can positively regulate MDM2 expression. Therefore, we conjecture that CA treatment can directly downregulate YAP expression via regulating MDM2-mediated ubiquitination in a p53-independent manner.In conclusion, the present study explored the roles and underlying mechanisms of CA in the treatment of HCC. We revealed that CA decreased cell viability and tumorigenesis and promoted cell apoptosis through translocating YAP from the nucleus in HCC in the presence of MDM2.",
25,TA034147,10.1038/s41598-025-86369-1,α-Copaene is a potent repellent against the Asian Citrus Psyllid Diaphorinacitri.,"The Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri, severely threatens citrusproduction worldwide by transmitting the greening (= Huanglongbing)-causingbacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. There is growing evidence that thepush-pull strategy is suitable to partially mitigate HLB by repelling ACP withtransgenic plants engineered to produce repellents and attracting the vector toplants with a minimal disease transmission rate. Species that pull ACP away fromcommercial citrus plants have been identified, and transgenic plants that repelACP have been developed. The concept of a repellent-producing plant was firstdemonstrated with an Arabidopsis line engineered to overexpress a genecontrolling the synthesis of β-caryophyllene and other sesquiterpenes. We haveanalyzed the volatile organic compounds released by this Arabidopsis line andidentified α-humulene, α-copaene, and trace amounts of β-elemene, in addition toβ-caryophyllene. Behavioral measurements demonstrated that α-copaene repels ACPat doses ca. 100× lower than those needed for β-caryophyllene repellence. Incontrast, α-humulene is innocuous at the level emitted by the transgenic plant.We confirmed that a mixture of the three sesquiterpenes in the ratio 1:100:10repels ACP. Likewise, a commercial sample of copaiba oil containing the threesesquiterpenes, in a proportion similar to that in the transgenic plant, repelledACP.","Magnani, Rodrigo Facchini, Volpe, Haroldo Xavier Linhares, Luvizotto, Rejane Angélica Grigio, Mulinari, Tatiana Aparecida, Agostini, Thiago Trevisoli, Bastos, Jairo Kenupp, Ribeiro, Victor Pena, Carmo-Sousa, Michele, Wulff, Nelson Arno, Peña, Leandro, Leal, Walter S",2025,Scientific reports,2,False,False,True,"The Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), is a vector of the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), which causes the citrus disease known as huanglongbing (HLB) or greening. HLB has already decimated the citrus industry in Florida and continues to be a severe threat to citrus production worldwide. Brazil is the largest orange producer in the world and has been sustaining severe losses since 2004 when HLB was detected for the first time in the State of São Paulo. The latest assessment indicates a greening incidence rate of 44.35% (90.6 million citrus trees) in the State of São Paulo and the State of Minas Gerais West-Southwest region. Therefore, strategies to control ACP populations and/or reduce CLas transmission are sorely needed. One promising environmentally sustainable approach to mitigate ACP’s threat is push–pull, which integrates lures to attract (pull) and stimuli to repel (push) insect pests and disease vectors. For example, ornamental and other Rutaceae plants that attract ACP to a refuge area may be combined with transgenic plants that produce ACP repellents. Orange jasmine, Murraya paniculata (Rutaceae), known in Brazil as murta, has been demonstrated to attract ACP, but only 1% of psyllids may be infected by feeding on this plant species. On the other hand, the concept of plants that repel ACP was first shown with a transgenic Arabidopsis line and, subsequently, with sweet orange plants. The first ACP-repellent transgenic Arabidopsis line was engineered to overexpress the sesquiterpene synthase gene At5g44630, which was previously demonstrated to be involved in the synthesis of β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, α-copaene, and β-elemene. Biosynthetically, these sesquiterpenes are derived from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) by distinct cyclization and derivatization pathways. For example, while β-caryophyllene is derived from the cyclization through FPP’s carbons 1 and 11, α-copaene is produced after the cyclization of FPP’s carbons 1 and 10. Thus, the Arabidopsis line engineered to produce β-caryophyllene is expected to make other sesquiterpenes, although we cannot predict their ratios. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis line yields α-copaene, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene in the nominal ratio of 1:100:10, and trace amounts of β-elemene. Behavioral measurements demonstrated that α-copaene is a potent repellent effective at 100x lower doses than β-caryophyllene. Although these two sesquiterpene repellents did not synergize, when combined, they seemed to overload the ACP’s olfactory system, thus requiring a lower dose to repel ACP. Behavioral measurements suggest that α-humulene is innocuous at the levels produced by the transgenic plant. Therefore, the tertiary mixture emitted by the transgenic plant effectively repels ACP. Lastly, we demonstrate that a commercially available copaiba oil containing β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and α-copaene in a ratio similar to that yielded by the transgenic plant is also an effective ACP repellent.","The adults of D. citri used in bioassays were derived from a Ca. Liberibacter spp-free colony maintained for several generations in a greenhouse at FUNDECITRUS. The insects were kept in metal cages covered with anti-aphid mesh (200 mesh). Orange jasmine plants (M. paniculata) were grown in a greenhouse with no controlled-climate conditions from seeds in 2.6 L plastic pots containing a commercially available substrate (Multiplant citrus®, Terra do Paraiso, Holambra, Sao Paulo, Brazil), which is composed of 80% Pinus sp. bark, 15% vermiculite, and 5% charcoal. They were supplied once a week with a water solution of minerals and water-irrigated twice weekly. Seedlings were pruned to a height of 30 cm to stimulate the emergence of shoots. After sprouting (0.5 to 1.0 cm in length), the seedlings were placed in cages, into which 400 mated adults were released 10–15 days after emergence. The adults were kept in cages for 7 days for oviposition on the seedlings. After that, the adults were removed, and the seedlings containing eggs were retained in the cages for nymphal development. Cages containing fourth- and fifth-instar nymphs were transported to an air-conditioned room (temperature 25 ± 2 °C, relative humidity 60% ± 10%, and photoperiod 14-h L:10-h D) for the emergence of adults and maintenance of insects under environmental conditions similar to those used in behavioral assays. Newly emerged adults were removed from cages daily and confined on M. paniculata seedlings coated with a tulle-like material for mating and age control of the insects. We used mated females between 7 and 15 days after emergence for all bioassays.All repellence responses were measured with a previously described multi-choice olfactometer operated in a climate-controlled room at 25 ± 2°C, 65 ± 10% relative humidity, and 3000 lx luminosity. In brief, we used an acrylic 4-arm olfactometer (30.0 × 30.0 × 2.5 cm; length × width × height, respectively) with a transparent acrylic lid and a yellow laserjet print paper (lightness, 84.8; chroma, 98.7; and hue angle, 95.7) under the device. Compressed air (charcoal filtered and subsequently humidified) was connected to a stainless-steel line. It split into four individual 0.635-cm-diameter polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubes (Sigma–Aldrich, Bellefonte, PA, USA) connected to four flowmeters [0.1–1 L per minute (LPM), Brooks Instruments, Hatfield, PA, USA], adjusted to an airflow of 0.1 LPM. Each PTFE tube was connected to one horizontal glass chamber (20 cm length × 6 cm internal diameter) containing an odor source (two sources of α-copaene, β- caryophyllene, and α-humulene treatment, and two sources of hexane, control; both loaded on cotton swabs), and each airflow converged through PTFE tubes to one of the four device arms. Data recorded for the time of residence of individual insects in each odor field (treatment or control) were first analyzed to determine normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test with the Prism 10.1.1 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, California, USA). Data that did not meet the assumption of normal distribution were analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Descriptive statistics are provided in the figure and figure legends. Means are presented along the standard error of the means (mean ± sem).To test mixtures, it is critical to release semiochemicals in the desired ratio despite differences in the volatility of the mixture’s constituents. We used a slow-release (“dynamic”) device inspired on the “wick-baits” designed to release a steady flow of semiochemical mixtures faithfully representing the proportion of the components in the mixture. The “dynamic” device was comprised of a 2 ml screw-top clear glass vial (#27329, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) capped with a blue polypropylene screw cap (#SU860092, Supelco). A 4 cm PTFE tubing (ID 1.58 mm; OD 2.1 mm, Supelco, #20531) filled with cotton yarn wick (“barbante cru 100% algodão,” São Francisco Industrial & Comercial Textil Ltd., Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil) was inserted through the vial’s cap PTFE septum and placed 1 mm from the bottom of the vial. The cotton yarn wick was prepared by washing for 5 min in hexane, three times and then dried up before inserting into the tubing. The vials were loaded with 1 ml of hexane solutions of individual compounds or mixtures.For volatile collections, each outlet of the glass odor chambers was connected to a homemade two-way glass valve with PTFE connectors. Each side of the valve was connected to a Tenax® TA tube for capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The outlets of the two Tenax tubes were connected to a second two-way glass valve, and the final outlet tube was connected to a vacuum line. These two-way valve systems allowed continuous sampling for time course analysis without disrupting the headspace or the airflow. After a specific time (e.g., 3 min), the airflow was diverted to the oppositive side to trap VOCs for the next time measurement (e.g., 3–6 min). The Tenax tube was replaced with a clean one for the subsequent collection (e.g., 6–9 min); the trapped VOCs were analyzed as described below. The specific collection for each experiment is described in the figure legends. Multiple glass odor chambers (N = 7–11) were used for replicates.Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) captured in headspace samples were analyzed using thermal desorber–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) equipment. The volatile compounds were thermally desorbed from Tenax® TA (0.635 × 8.89 cm glass tubes containing 200 mg of 2.6-diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide 35–60 mesh; Sigma-Aldrich, Bellefonte, PA, USA) in the TD equipment (ULTRA-xr Thermal Desorber, Markes International Ltd., Llantrisant, UK) under a 50 mL/min helium gas flow heated to 280 °C for 5 min. The VOCs were directed to Tenax® TA-based cold traps and were cryogenically captured at a temperature of -20 °C. Subsequently, the cold traps were desorbed at 300 °C for 3 min—the transfer lines from the cold traps to the gas chromatographs were set at 200 °C. The GC column temperature was maintained at 40°C during the desorption phase. For GC-MS analyses, the following instruments were used: Shimadzu’s QP2010-plus (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and Thermo’s TRACE 1310/TSQ 9000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific (Austin, TX, USA). The Shimadzu’s GC instrument was equipped with Rxi-5ms columns (10 m, 0.10 mm, 0.10 μm film thickness or 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness; Restek, Bellefonte, PA). The Thermo’s GC (TRACE 1310) had a 10 m Rxi-5ms column. The Shimadzu’s and Thermo’s GC/MS transfer lines were kept at 250 °C. The ovens of the GCs equipped with 10 m columns were operated at the initial temperature of 40 °C and a rate of 20 °C/min until 250 °C, and then it was held at the final temperature for 2 min [40-20-250(2)]. The temperature program for GCs with 30 m columns was 40-7-250(5). Mass spectra were obtained at a collision energy of 70 eV, and all analyses were recorded in total ion chromatogram (TIC) mode, with a scanning range of m/z 40 to 450. Authentic compounds for chemical identification and quantification (calibration curves) were injected into a Calibration Solution Loading Ring (CSLR, Tenax® TA) at 0.1 ml/min for 5 min. The authentic compounds loaded on Tenax® TA tubes were desorbed, cryogenically captured, and subsequently injected into GCs following the sampling protocol described above for natural products. Copaiba oil was initially analyzed by injecting 0.5 µl hexane samples into GC-MS for chemical identification and estimation of the ratios. The oven was operated at 60-15-300(2), helium (0.4 ml/min) was used as the carrier gas, and the injector in the split mode (20:1) was set at 250 °C. The emission rates of copaiba oil and other individual repellents were measured with calibration curves obtained with authentic standards using the thermal desorber-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique.β-Caryophyllene (≥ 98.5% purity) and α-humulene (≥ 96.0% purity) were acquired from Sigma Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). α-Copaene (94% purity) and hexane (≥ 99.0% purity) were acquired from TRC (Toronto, Canada) and Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. Copaiba oil, labeled as ‘refined copaiba oil’ was purchased from BERACA Ingredientes Naturais (BR03310BX45, batch 09183310R, Levilandia-Anamindeuz, Para, Brazil).Seeds of the previously reported A. thaliana line overexpressing the β-caryophyllene synthase At5g23960 were grown to the flowering stage on soil in a controlled climate chamber at 22 °C and 55% relative humidity for up to seven weeks under a photoperiod 14-h L:10-h D, and 3000 lx.","Previously, we have demonstrated that ACP is repelled by authentic β-caryophyllene and volatiles emitted by A. thaliana line overexpressing synthase At5g23960. Because β-caryophyllene was also the main volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by guava plants (Psidium guajava) known to repel ACP, it was concluded that this sesquiterpene was the main active ingredient in the transgenic Arabidopsis line. Considering that in A. thaliana, At5g23960 converts farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) into β-caryophyllene, α-copaene, α-humulene, and β-elemene by different FPP cyclization pathways, we analyzed VOCs to determine the ratio of these sesquiterpenes in the transgenic Arabidopsis line.Thermal desorber–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) analyses identified β-caryophyllene, α-copaene, and α-humulene in the VOCs emitted by the transgenic Arabidopsis line (Fig. 1) based on their retention times, mass spectra, and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) library searches. Analyses of authentic standards of β-caryophyllene, α-copaene, and α-humulene corroborated these initial identifications. Given that the absolute configurations of A. thaliana-derived caryophyllene and copaene are already known as (-)-(E)-caryophyllene (=β-caryophyllene, IUPAC name, (1R,4E,9S)-4,11,11-trimethyl-8-methylidenebicyclo[7.2.0]undec-4-ene, CAS#87-44-5) and (-)-α-copaene (= copaene, IUPAC name, (1R,2S,6S,7S,8S)-1,3-dimethyl-8-propan-2-yltricyclo[4.4.0.02,7]dec-3-ene, CAS#3856-25-5), we did not pursue stereochemistry analysis. Likewise, humulene from A. thaliana has been identified as α-humulene (= humulene, α-caryophyllene, IUPAC name, (1E,4E,8E)-2,6,6,9-tetramethylcycloundeca-1,4,8-triene, CAS# 6753-98-6). The transgenic Arabidopsis line VOC samples also contained trace amounts of β-elemene.With seven replicates, we determine the relative ratio of the three sesquiterpenes in airborne volatiles emitted by the transgenic Arabidopsis line to be 0.95 ± 0.06/100/9.82 ± 0.44 (α-copaene, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene). In sum, β-caryophyllene is released on average 10x more than α-humulene and 100× more than α-copaene.For behavioral studies involving mixtures of semiochemicals with different vapor pressures (like emanations from the transgenic Arabidopsis line), it is crucial to use devices that faithfully release semiochemicals in the same ratios as their sources and in a steady fashion.Previously, we have used static devices to release semiochemicals when measuring their repellence activity. Specifically, the test compounds like β-caryophyllene were released from open glass vials (2 ml) containing hexane solutions (100 µl) of the semiochemicals.For subsequent behavioral measurements, we used a dynamic device inspired by the “wick-baits” designed to release a steady flow of semiochemical mixtures faithfully representing the proportion of the components in a mixture. We have already demonstrated that β-caryophyllene at 1 µg/µl released from a static device (open glass vial) elicited repellence activity in ACP. First, we determined the concentration of β-caryophyllene in our dynamic device equivalent to the 1 µg/µl dose in the static device. For that, we captured β-caryophyllene from the static device (n = 17) and generated a calibration curve using 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 µg/µl of β-caryophyllene solutions loaded into the dynamic devices (n = 3 for each dose). These analyses showed that the amount of β-caryophyllene in the airborne volatiles emitted from a static device (source dose, 1 µg/µl dose) is equivalent to 0.17 ± 0.01 µg/µl (mean ± sem; throughout the paper means are accompanied by the standard error of the means).Next, we measured ACP behavioral responses to β-caryophyllene (0.17 µg/µl source dose) released from our dynamic device. ACP females spent significantly more time in the control (hexane) than in the β-caryophyllene field (n = 99, p = 0.0152, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranked test; hereafter Wilcoxon test; mean residence times in the β-caryophyllene and control fields were 4.06 ± 0.39 min and 5.94 ± 0.39 min, respectively) (Fig. 2B). There were no significant differences between treatment and control when tested at lower and higher doses of β-caryophyllene (0.13 µg/µl, n = 103, p = 0.3792; 0.22 µg/µl, n = 111, p = 0.1569) (Fig. 2A, C).Next, we measured the rate of β-caryophyllene emitted from our dynamic device loaded with the active dose of 0.17 µg/µl. VOCs released from the device were captured by Tenax® TA columns and analyzed by TD-GC-MS. The release rate of β-caryophyllene was 0.044 ± 0.013 µg/min (n = 21).Additionally, we measured the time-release relationships of β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and α-copaene to determine the stability of our dynamic device throughout repellency assays (15 min; behavioral measurement time, 10 min). Solutions (n = 11) of authentic α-copaene, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene (1:100:10), β-caryophyllene concentration of 0.17 µg/µl) were loaded on dynamic devices. VOCs were captured every three minutes for 15 min, with 11 replicates. TD-GC-MS analyses showed a steady release of these semiochemicals throughout the recorded time (Fig. 3), thus corroborating earlier findings with other semiochemicals and indicating these devices are suitable for behavioral experiments.We surmised whether α-copaene or α-humulene at the rates released from the A. thaliana line overexpressing synthase At5g23960 would affect ACP behavioral responses to β-caryophyllene. There was no significant difference in ACP residence times in the odor and control fields when α-humulene was tested at the source dose of 0.017 µg/µl, i.e., 1/10th of β-caryophyllene’s dose (n = 101, p = 0.3145, Wilcoxon test; mean residence times in the treatment and control fields were 5.31 ± 0.30 min and 4.68 ± 0.30 min, respectively). By contrast, ACP females were significantly repelled by α-copaene at a dose 100x lower than β-caryophyllene in the emanations from the transgenic plant, i.e., 1.7 ng/µl (n = 106, p = 0.0168, Wilcoxon test; mean residence times in the treatment and control fields were 4.25 ± 0.31 min and 5.75 ± 0.31 min, respectively). Intriguingly, it has been reported that 1 µg/µl of α-copaene repels ACP, a dose 588x higher than the dose we tested. We surmised this discrepancy could be derived from different methods for releasing α-copaene. However, the release rate reported for the active dose (32 ± 0.2 µg/min) was 40,000x higher than the release rate of α-copaene in our experiments (n = 17, 0.80 ± 0.04 ng/min). Dose-response relationship analysis demonstrated that α-copaene is repellent at 0.9 to 2.1 ng/µl (source doses). We tested α-copaene at eight doses from 0.1 to 2.9 ng/µl. Specifically, 0.1 ng/µl (n = 99, p = 0.4262), 0.5 ng/µl (n = 107, p = 0.7954), 0.9 ng/µl (n = 129, p = 0.0042), 1.3 ng/µl (n = 126, p = 0.0052), 1.7 ng/µl (n = 106, p = 0.0168), 2.1 ng/µl (n = 117, p = 0.0210), 2.5 ng/µl (n = 107, p = 0.3124), 2.9 ng/µl (n = 103, p = 0.6154; Wilcoxon tests). At doses ranging from 0.9 to 2.1 ng/µl, ACP females spent significantly more time in the control than in the α-copaene fields (Fig. 4).Violin plots represent the differential residence times, i.e., the residence times in the arena’s control fields minus the residence times in the treatment fields. Statistical significance was determined by comparing the original residence times in the treatment and control fields (Wilcoxon test). Medians and quartiles are denoted by dashed and solid lines, respectively. The violin plots corresponding to significantly different means of residence times (p < 0.05) were colored green. The numbers of replicates are shown below each violin plot.In conclusion, at the doses calculated based on the ratio of sesquiterpenes released from A. thaliana overexpressing the enzyme involved in synthesizing these sesquiterpenes, α-copaene and β-caryophyllene are repellents, but α-humulene is not. Next, we examined whether the active repellents would synergize.Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in the ACP residence times in the control and treatment fields when a mixture of 100:1 β-caryophyllene (0.17 µg/µl) and α-copaene (1.7 ng/µl) was tested (n = 100, p = 0.6841, Wilcoxon test) (Fig. 5A). ACP females spent 5.15 ± 0.29 min and 4.85 ± 0.29 min in the treatment and control fields, respectively. Because β-caryophyllene and α-copaene are active when tested individually at these doses (Figs. 2B and Fig. 4), we hypothesized that they saturated the olfactory system when combined. To test this hypothesis, we measured the repellence with a mixture of 100:1 β-caryophyllene and α-copaene at the doses of 0.13 µg/µl and 1.3 ng/µl, respectively. ACP females spent significantly more time in the control than in the treatment fields (n = 108, p = 0.0391; Wilcoxon test) (Fig. 5B). ACP females spent 4.51 ± 0.26 min and 5.49 ± 0.26 min in the treatment and control fields, respectively. Because β-caryophyllene per se is not active at this dose (0.13 µg/µl, Fig. 2A), we concluded that α-copaene plays a more crucial role in the repellence elicited by the Arabidopsis transgenic line, which has enormous potential for practical applications.Although α-humulene was not active per se at the dose determined by the β-caryophyllene/ α-humulene ratio emitted by the Arabidopsis transgenic line (Fig. 1), we tested a tertiary mixture, given the unexpected interaction between α-copaene and β-caryophyllene (Fig. 5A). ACP females spent significantly less time in the field permeated with a 100:10:1 mixture of β-caryophyllene (0.13 µg/µl), α-humulene (0.013 µg/µl), α-copaene (1.3 ng/µl) than in the control fields (n = 112, p = 0.0224, Wilcoxon test).Whether the two repellents (β-caryophyllene and α-copaene) act on the same olfactory neuron on the ACP sensilla is unknown. Single unit recordings showed that β-caryophyllene elicits the most robust response from tested plant compounds by activating the sensory neuron B in the antennal rhinarial plate 7 (RP7), but α-copaene has never been tested. One may speculate that being isomers, α-copaene and β-caryophyllene would act on the same neuron. However, α-humulene is also a β-caryophyllene isomer and activates the sensory neuron B in RP2.We concluded that two of the sesquiterpenes enriched in the Arabidopsis transgenic line, β-caryophyllene and α-copaene, are repellents against ACP, but humulene is not. Of note, α-copaene is active at doses ca. 100 times lower than the active doses of β-caryophyllene.Copaifera species (Fabaceae), also known in Brazil as “copaiba,” are well-known sources of sesquiterpenes for applications in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Interestingly, β-caryophyllene, α-copaene, and α-humulene appear to be the chemical markers in Copaifera volatile oils. Although the contents vary remarkably among Copaifera species and variants, we noticed that the chromatogram profiles of the oil derived from a species native to Brazil, Copaifera langsdorffii, resemble that of the Arabidopsis transgenic line (Fig. 1). GC-MS analyses showed that a sample of copaiba oil from Beraca contained β-caryophyllene (517.09 ± 9.54 mg/ml), α-humulene (60.33 ± 0.71 mg/ml), and α-copaene (28.26 ± 0.50 mg/ml). A shoulder peak after the β-caryophyllene peak was tentatively identified as α-bergamotene (CAS# 13474-59-4).To test the repellence activity of the copaiba oil, we diluted the commercial product 3500X to generate a sample with approximately the same active dose of β-caryophyllene (Fig. 2B). The diluted copaiba oil repelled ACP females, which spent significantly more time in the control (6.02 ± 0.28 min) than in the treatment fields (3.98 ± 0.28 min, n = 115, p = 0.0005, Wilcoxon test). The ACP responses to control and treatments did not significantly differ when the copaiba oil was diluted 4000× or 3000× (n = 122, p = 0.1402; n = 99, p = 0.3939, respectively).Next, we measured the emission rates of the active repellents β-caryophyllene and α-copaene by TD-GC-MS (Fig. 6). The emission rates of these repellents captured in the headspace generated by 3500× diluted samples (n = 8) were β-caryophyllene (67 ± 3 ng/min) and α-copaene (8.4 ± 0.1 ng/min). The ratio of α-copaene/β-caryophyllene was 0.128 ± 0.006 (n = 8).This TD-GC-MS chromatogram was obtained with a commercial copaiba oil (Beraca) sample. The most prominent peaks were identified as (1) α-copaene, (2) β-caryophyllene, and (3) α-humulene based on their mass spectra, retention times, and comparison with authentic standards. This profile resembles the chromatogram obtained with VOCs from the Arabidopsis transgenic line (Fig. 1).As expected, the Arabidopsis transgenic line that overexpresses the sesquiterpene synthase At5g44630 yields β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, α-copaene, and traces amounts of β-elemene. With TD-GC-MS, we demonstrated that β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and α-copaene are released in an approximate ratio of 100:10:1. Our studies further corroborate that β-caryophyllene released from a dynamic device loaded with 0.17 µg/µl, a dose equivalent to 1 µg/µl in a static device (open glass vial), repels ACP females. The dynamic device loaded with 1000 µl of 0.17 µg/µl releases β-caryophyllene at 0.044 ± 0.013 µg/min. Interestingly, α-copaene is an even more potent repellent, active at 0.80 ± 0.04 ng/min, i.e., a 55× lower amount. Additionally, α-copaene showed a more comprehensive range of active concentrations (0.9 to 2.1 ng/µl) than β-caryophyllene. Previously, α-copaene has been reported as a repellent against ACP, but intriguingly, the tested dose (1 µg/µl) was more than 500× higher than the active range of concentrations we found in these studies. Although we did not find evidence of synergistic activity between α-copaene and β-caryophyllene, higher doses of the two repellents combined may overload the olfactory system. It is worth noting that upon release into the environment (whether from plants or chemical devices), β-caryophyllene and α-copaene undergo degradation, with β-caryophyllene depleting more rapidly, partly because of the two double bonds (as opposed to a single double bond in α-copaene, Fig. 1). It has been estimated that the rate constant for β-caryophyllene reaction with ozone is ca. 38× the rate constant for α-copaene. Therefore, α-copaene seems more suitable for possible repellent chemical formulations. The data presented here show that copaiba oil is an economically viable source of these sesquiterpene repellents, which may be explored to develop slow-releasing devices to repel ACP.Our studies further demonstrate that transgenic plants overexpressing β-caryophyllene and α-copaene may become a promising tool in ACP management strategies. For example, combined with plants attractive to ACP (e.g., M. paniculata, Bergera koenigii), these transgenic plants may be applied in push-pull strategies. These findings enable new studies involving ACP repellents emanated by releasers or plants combined with trap plants or other attractants to achieve behavioral control to be added to the ACP integrated management tools.",,
26,TA040077,10.1093/jxb/erad482,Carotenoid retention during post-harvest storage of Capsicum annuum: the role ofthe fruit surface structure.,"In this study, a chilli pepper (Capsicum annuum) panel for post-harvestcarotenoid retention was studied to elucidate underlying mechanisms associatedwith this commercial trait of interest. Following drying and storage, some lineswithin the panel had an increase in carotenoids approaching 50% compared with theinitial content at the fresh fruit stage. Other lines displayed a 25% loss ofcarotenoids. The quantitative determination of carotenoid pigments withconcurrent cellular analysis indicated that in most cases, pepper fruit withthicker (up to 4-fold) lipid exocarp layers and smooth surfaces exhibit improvedcarotenoid retention properties. Total cutin monomer content increased inmedium/high carotenoid retention fruits and subepidermal cutin deposits wereresponsible for the difference in exocarp thickness. Cutin biosynthesis andcuticle precursor transport genes were differentially expressed betweenmedium/high and low carotenoid retention genotypes, and this supports thehypothesis that the fruit cuticle can contribute to carotenoid retention.Enzymatic degradation of the cuticle and cell wall suggests that in Capsicum thecarotenoids (capsanthin and its esters) are embedded in the lipidic exocarplayer. This was not the case in tomato. Collectively, the data suggest that thefruit cuticle could provide an exploitable resource for the enhancement of fruitquality.","Holden, Alexandra C, Cohen, Hagai, Berry, Harriet M, Rickett, Daniel V, Aharoni, Asaph, Fraser, Paul D",2024,Journal of experimental botany,2,True,False,True,"In chilli peppers (Capsicum annuum), carotenoid pigments are responsible for the different yellow, orange, and red colouration found in ripe fruit. In addition to carotenoids conferring aesthetic and nutritional properties to the fruit, the post-harvest retention of colour is also an important fruit quality trait.The pepper crop is in demand from consumers all year round. However, due to environmental conditions in pepper-growing regions, the crop cannot be grown and harvested throughout the year. Therefore, storage of dry peppers following harvest is essential. Pepper fruits must retain quality, including colour, during post-harvest storage. Post-harvest storage losses are observed not only in fruit crops, but also in other important crops, including rice, wheat, and maize, and this affects colour and nutritional quality. Furthermore, whilst increased provitamin A capacity has been engineered in rice, resulting in a carotenoid-enriched variety known as ‘Golden rice’, maintaining such increased nutritional properties has proved challenging, as carotenoid degradation occurs upon post-harvest storage.Capsanthin and capsorubin are the two major carotenoids found in red pepper fruits, which are almost unique to the ripe fruit of peppers. Capsanthin and capsorubin are synthesized from antheraxanthin and violaxanthin, respectively, by the action of CAPSANTHIN/CAPSORUBIN SYNTHASE (CCS). Pepper carotenoids are commonly found to be esterified, making them more stable than free carotenoids. Carotenoids not only contribute to the colour properties to pepper fruits, but further have high antioxidant capacity and are therefore beneficial to human health. This antioxidant capacity is a result of their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), due to their conjugated double bond structure. Upon interaction of carotenoids with singlet oxygen (1O2), physical quenching occurs, in which energy is transferred between the two molecules. The excess energy of 1O2 is transferred to the carotenoid and yields ground state oxygen and a triplet excited carotene. Oxidation of carotenoids results in the formation of cleavage products, collectively referred to as apocarotenoids. Excessive carotenoid degradation results in colour loss. In a recent study using an identical chilli pepper panel, it was found that increased unsaturated fatty acids along with altered lipid and carotenoid-derived volatiles are associated with genotypes displaying altered colour/carotenoid retention properties. These findings have led to the hypothesis that post-harvest loss of colour/carotenoids in chilli fruit derives from lipid peroxidation and the engagement of carotenoids to scavenge and dissipate ROS, while being degraded in the process. The question arising now is: how are these ROS initiated?Waxy cuticles are an essential part of a plant’s physiology and play a fundamental role in the plant’s interaction with the environment.. The cuticle has been further suggested to have a role in the post-harvest quality of fruit. Plant cuticles are comprised of two components: cutin monomers and waxy, or lipophilic, components, which are embedded within the cutin matrix, as reviewed in. The cuticle provides a barrier to control the entrance and exit of gases in fruits, which lack stomata. Intact pepper fruit cuticle has been shown to be permeable to a small amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen, though this permeability increases significantly upon wounding of the cuticle. Whilst gaseous exchange is essential, negative effects may be observed as a result. The role of antioxidants is evident in protecting against the harmful effects of ROS, which may be formed during the process of gaseous exchange.There is some dispute over whether this ‘cuticular’ layer, which penetrates several cell layers deep, can be termed the ‘cuticle’. For this reason, the ‘cuticular layer’ spanning several cell layers has been termed the ‘wax exocarp’, which is defined as the outermost lipophilic layer of the pericarp of an angiosperm fruit, external to the mesocarp. Pepper fruit cuticular components, and associated cuticle morphology quantitative trait loci have been previously identified.In the present study, the association of post-harvest carotenoid retention traits in chilli with altered fruit surface structure has been investigated.","All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, UK, unless stated otherwise. A commercial panel of 12 chilli pepper genotypes displaying diversity in colour intensity and retention phenotypes was provided by Syngenta. Capsicum annuum L. cv. CM334 (Criollo de Morelos 334) was also included in the diversity panel. Material was grown in glasshouses (25°C, 16/8 h light/dark).Pepper fruits were harvested when ripe and dried in an oven (30–40 °C) under a 12/12 h light cycle. Pepper fruits were dried for 2 weeks before being stored in hessian bags (4 °C) for a period of between 2 and 12 weeks. These conditions were selected in order to replicate the industrial drying and storage process that occurs during commercial growing and storage of chilli peppers.Carotenoids were extracted from lyophilized and homogenized chilli pepper powder. A 10 mg aliquot of tissue was used in the extraction process, employing chloroform (500 µl) and HPLC-grade methanol (250 µl). The suspension was incubated on ice, in the dark, before HPLC-grade water (250 µl) was added. A phase separation was created, and the organic layer was collected. Chloroform (500 µl) was again added to the material for extraction, a phase separation was created, and the organic layer was pooled with the initial organic phase. Separation and detection of carotenoids was performed by HPLC with photodiode array (PDA) detection, using a C30 reverse-phase column (250 × 4.6 mm), purchased from YMC, Wilmington, NC, USA. The solvent system used has been detailed previously. Carotenoids isolated from pepper fruit exocarp discs (1 cm) were extracted by washing discs in chloroform and methanol (1:1 ratio; 10 ml) in dark conditions, on a rotator. Wash solution was replaced every 24 h, and all solvent used for extraction were pooled and evaporated. Exocarp carotenoids were analysed by HPLC-PDA, as described.Discs (1 cm) of fruit pericarp tissue were dissected, and cuticle tissue was isolated using pectinase (1.5% w/v) and cellulase (0.1% w/v) in citrate buffer (0.2 mM, pH 3.7), with sodium azide (1 mM). Samples were incubated with shaking in dark conditions (35 °C; 4 d, 100 rpm). Cutin monomer extraction was performed as previously described. Analysis of extracted cutin monomers was performed using a GC-MS system (Agilent 7683 autosampler, 7890A gas chromatograph, and 5975C mass spectrometer).Fruit discs of 1 cm were dissected and dipped in chloroform (10 ml; 10 s), with the cuticle side facing downwards, into solvent to extract cuticle-bound waxes. Deuterated triacontane (C30, 10 µg) was added as an internal standard. Ten discs per biological sample were dipped. Following cuticle wax extraction, the extract was transferred to a cleaned glass vial and dried under nitrogen. Extracts were resuspended in fresh chloroform (500 µl) and transferred to a glass GC-MS vial. Extracts were dried under nitrogen, and derivatized for analysis using pyridine (30 µl) and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA; 70 µl). Samples were incubated (40 °C; 1 h) before analysis. Analysis of cuticle waxes was performed using a GC-MS system (Agilent 7820A gas chromatograph and 5977B mass spectrometer).For both cutin monomer and cuticle wax analysis, a DB-1HT capillary column (Agilent, J+W 122-1131; 30 m×250 µm×0.1 µm) was used, with a flow rate of 1.2 ml min–1. Samples were injected in splitless mode at 200 °C, with helium as the carrier gas. The oven temperature was held at 70 °C for 2 min, before ramping at 10°C min–1 to 150 °C, and then ramping at 3 °C min–1 to 310 °C. The final temperature was held for a further 20 min. MS was performed in full scan mode. Identification of chromatogram components was performed by comparing mass spectra with literature-reported spectra, in-house libraries, and the NIST 2.0 MS library. Quantification was performed by calculating peak areas relative to the internal standard.Fresh fruit were harvested, and hand sectioning was used to dissect cross-sections from the middle of the fruit. Sections were collected in distilled water. Nile Red (0.5 mg ml–1) in acetone was used to stain lipids, and Fast Green (0.5% w/v) in ethanol (90%) was used to stain subepidermal cell layers. Sections were washed in distilled water, before mounting on glass slides. A Leica DM 500 compound light microscope was used for visualization, with ×10 and ×20 objective lenses. IMS (Imagic, Imaging Ltd) software was used to capture images.Exocarp thickness was measured using ImageJ software employing light microscopy images. Exocarp was defined as the area stained pink following Nile Red staining. Three images per genotype were measured, and six measurements per image were recorded.Cross-sections of fruit were sectioned, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then sublimed (2 min) and coated with platinum. Cryo-SEM was performed using a Quorum Technologies PP3010T cryo-SEM system.Fruit samples were mounted on aluminium pin stubs (SEM sample supports), using adhesive carbon tabs. SEM was carried out using a Zeiss Evo LS15 scanning electron microscope. Sample imaging was carried out using variable pressure mode, and images were captured via a C2D detector.Three independent fruits at each of the designated developmental stages from one plant were used, with each plant representing a biological replicate. The transcriptomic analysis focused on line R8 because it showed medium carotenoid retention and high colour retention, compared with other lines such as R5 and R6 that had high carotenoid retention but medium colour retention. In addition, R8 was one of the most amenable lines to the extraction of RNA with good integrity profiles. Abrasive paper was used to isolate fruit epidermal cells, and total RNA was extracted and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen, UK) and the PureLink RNA Minikit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (ThermoFisher Scientific) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Following quality control, an mRNA library was prepared using NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep with sample purification beads, and in-house (Syngenta Ltd, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) 8 bp indexes. Libraries were sequenced using a Hi-Seq system (Illumina). Gene count was normalized using the R package EDASeq v2.16.3, and filtered. Reads were mapped to the published CM334 chilli pepper genome. The unprocessed transcriptomic data have been deposited with the NCBI under BioProject PRJNA640935.Fruits were harvested and dried as previously described. Fruits were treated with varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), either before or after fruit drying, and then stored (4 °C) for 1 month. Carotenoid content was measured using HPLC-PDA analysis.All experiments typically used 3–6 biological replicates, unless stated otherwise. This refers to one plant from which three fruit are used/harvested and analysed as an independent biological replicate. Graphs were compiled using GraphPad Prism 8 software, and means, SD, and SE were calculated using Excel (Microsoft). Significance testing, including Student’s t-tests and ANOVA, were carried out using XLstat software (Addinsoft). Student’s t-test significances were represented as: *P<0.05; **P<0.01.","Previous studies have classified the colour retention properties of the commercial panel used, on visual colour intensity, image analysis, and end-point carotenoid content, following post-harvest storage (Table 1). To increase the robustness of this classification, the present study measured carotenoid contents of the pepper fruit before oven drying and throughout post-harvest storage (Table 1). Over this period, the 13 genotypes displayed varying levels of carotenoids. The genotype R3 contained only 2.5 mg g–1 DW of carotenoids at the fresh fruit stage, whereas genotype R7 contained >18 mg g–1 DW of carotenoids at the same fruit stage (Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, the change in carotenoid content during the 12 week post-harvest storage period differed between the 13 pepper varieties analysed. Carotenoid retention was calculated as the change in carotenoid content between the fresh fruit time point and following 12 weeks of post-harvest storage. Some genotypes displayed very little change in total carotenoid content during post-harvest 4 °C storage, such as lines R1 and R12, whereas other lines showed significant increases (R5) or decreases (R7) in total carotenoid content. Effectively, this approach took into consideration initial carotenoid intensity, biosynthesis, and/or degradation during drying and throughout storage, all contributing to a measure of retention. However, other factors augmenting colour retention should not be ignored and it should be stated that carotenoid retention and colour retention are not the same parameter.Pepper genotypes were characterized as low, medium, or high carotenoid retention dependent on the change in carotenoid content during post-harvest storage. Arbitrary values were used to determine carotenoid retention phenotypes: lines which decreased in carotenoid content by >10% were deemed to be low retention (R3, R4), lines which showed a change in carotenoid content between –10% and 10% were deemed to be medium carotenoid retention (R1, R2), and lines which increased in carotenoid content by >10% were characterized as high retention (R5, R6). However, it should be stressed that a medium classified genotype that shows negligible loss in carotenoids over storage by definition has a colour retention trait, as is the case with the R8 line. In this case, the line has been referred to as a medium/high genotype to take into consideration the multiple classification parameters used. The R8 line is also ideal for this study as, besides having carotenoid retention, it has high colour retention, meaning that other parameters besides carotenoids could contribute to the trait of interest, in comparison with lines R5 and R6 that may have high carotenoid retention but display medium colour retention. Thus, there is a greater opportunity to elucidate parameters beyond carotenoids that contribute to colour.Post-harvest drying of pepper fruits resulted in vastly different fruit surface textures when comparing the 13 pepper genotypes. Following oven drying, some pepper fruits, such as genotypes R1, R6, and R8, retained the smooth, waxy surface texture that all genotypes had at the fresh time point, whilst other genotypes, such as R3, R4, and R7, displayed significant surface ‘wrinkling’. Therefore, all pepper genotypes were characterized as having either a smooth cuticle surface or a cracked cuticle surface (Supplementary Fig. S1). Genotypes characterized as low carotenoid retention tended to display a wrinkled surface texture following drying, whilst medium and high carotenoid retention fruits tended to display a smooth surface texture following drying (Fig. 1A).SEM further supported these differences between medium/high and low carotenoid retention pepper genotypes in their fruit surface texture. Low carotenoid retention genotypes R3 and R4 both had a ‘wrinkled’ surface texture, and showed evidence of surface cracks (Fig. 1B), whilst the medium/high carotenoid retention genotypes R6 and R8 both had smooth surface textures with no cracks present on the surface (Fig. 2A, B).Due to the differences observed between medium/high and low carotenoid retention genotypes in fruit surface structure following post-harvest drying, further analysis of the fruit surface structure was carried out.The outer surfaces of the pepper fruit, defined as the fruit exocarp, of fruits within the pepper diversity panel were observed using light microscopy (Fig. 2A) to determine whether variation in the fruit exocarp structure is associated with the carotenoid retention phenotype. Nile Red was used to stain the wax exocarp and Fast Green was used to stain pericarp, to clearly differentiate between these two tissue types. This method demonstrated that there was a clear difference in exocarp thickness within the fruits of the 13 pepper genotypes studied (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2). Staining showed that epidermal cells were embedded within the wax exocarp layer and, in some cases, the wax exocarp layer penetrated several cell layers deep into the fruit. Whilst some genotypes had a very thin exocarp layer, for example R3 and R7, which showed just one layer of cells embedded within the wax exocarp layer, other genotypes, such as R5 and R6, displayed up to four or five layers of cells embedded within the wax exocarp. This difference in exocarp thickness was further supported following cryo-SEM, which demonstrated that low carotenoid retention lines R3 and R4 both had just one layer of cells embedded within the outer layer, whilst lines R6 and R8 both displayed several cell layers embedded within the outer layer (Fig. 2B).Clear differences were observed in the thickness of the wax exocarp layer between different genotypes within the pepper panel. Whilst lines R1, R5, R6, and R8 all had an exocarp thickness ranging from 90 µm to 120 µm, lines R3 and R7 both had a thinner exocarp, with a thickness between 30 µm and 40 µm. The general trend appeared in which genotypes characterized as high or medium carotenoid retention also tended to have a thicker exocarp (Fig. 2C).The carotenoid retention phenotype is only observed upon ripening of the pepper fruit, thus the cuticle composition was analysed in ripe fruit using an established GC-MS-based method (see the Materials and methods), as this was deemed to be the most biologically relevant developmental stage for this trait. As a comparator, the cuticle of mature green fruit was also profiled (Supplementary Table S2).Significantly lower levels of 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid were observed in both low carotenoid retention genotypes, R3 and R4, when compared with the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype, R8, but not, however, compared with R6 (Fig. 3E). This compound accounts for ~90% of the total content of the cutin polymer, suggesting that low carotenoid retention is associated with lower total cutin content. In ripe fruit, R3 (low retention) had significantly lower levels of ferulic acid compared with genotypes R4 (low retention) and R6 (high retention) (Fig. 3A), and of octadeca-9,12-dienoate compared with genotypes R4, R6 (high retention), and R8 (medium/high retention) (Fig. 3C). The low carotenoid retention genotype, R3, displayed significantly lower total cutin monomer content when compared with the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype, R8, but no significant difference was observed between other genotypes (Fig. 3G). Overall, the differences in cutin monomer content reflect the differences observed in pepper exocarp thickness. When the cuticle components are represented as percentage composition per genotype (Supplementary Table S3), the data showed good corroboration. Only minor compositional changes are evident, the most notable being increased ferulic acid in R4, R6, and R8 (ranging from a 2- to 10-fold) increase. There were also minor compositional increases in the total cutin monomer component of R6 (high) and R8 (medium/high). A caveat that should be stated is the large dynamic range in the amounts of cuticle components experienced, and domination by total cutin monomers makes compositional changes difficult to interpret.The low carotenoid retention genotype, R3, displayed a significantly thinner exocarp compared with the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype, R8, and this significant difference between these two genotypes is further supported by the differences in their cutin compositions. The high carotenoid retention genotype, R6, also showed a thicker exocarp compared with R3 (low retention). However, no difference in total cutin monomer was reported between these two varieties. Thus, although there was no absolute correlation with the panel studied, the data suggested a trend between increased cutin monomer and carotenoid retention.Cuticular lipophilic components, which are embedded within the cutin matrix, were analysed in the four pepper fruit genotypes (R3, R4, R6, and R8). Whilst β-sitosterol levels were decreased in the low carotenoid retention genotype, R3 (Fig. 3I), no other significant differences, with which cuticular lipophilic composition and cuticle thickness were associated, were detected (Supplementary Table S2). The low carotenoid retention genotype, R4, displayed significantly higher levels of hentriacontane compared with the other genotypes analysed (Fig. 3H); however, this did not follow the emerging trend in which exocarp thickness, and hence cuticle composition, associates with the carotenoid retention phenotype. Consequently, cuticle lipophilic components did not appear to be associated with the carotenoid retention phenotype, or with exocarp thickness.RNA-seq was used to determine gene expression patterns in pepper fruit epidermal cells during cuticle development. From the R3 (low) and R8 (medium/high) retention genotypes, total RNA was isolated from pepper fruit epidermal tissue, in order to provide spatiotemporal resolution to gene expression analyses. This comparison was made based on the classification of retention provided in Table 1, exocarp thickness, fruit surface texture, biochemical changes in the cuticle composition, and logistical issues in obtaining RNA of sufficient quality from epidermal tissues. Genes involved in cuticle biosynthesis were identified in pepper, based on homology with orthologues in other species, previously reported to be involved in cuticle biosynthesis. Differentially expressed transcripts for gene ontologies associated with exocarp, epidermal/subepidermal cell layer, and development/differentiation only reveal one gene transcript throughout fruit development and ripening; this gene was Ca03g05300, cell differential protein rcd1 putative (Supplementary Dataset S1). A comparison of differentially expressed gene transcripts between R3 (low) and R8 (medium/high) retention are reported in Table 2. The pepper orthologue of the ABC transporter PERMEABLE CUTICLE1/ABCG32 (PEC1), which functions in the transfer of cutin components over the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis thaliana, was identified as significantly up-regulated in the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype compared with the low carotenoid retention genotype. Lipid transport proteins (LTPs) are considered to be involved in the transport of cutin monomers to the site of cuticle synthesis. Several LTPs were identified as differentially expressed between the medium/high and low carotenoid retention genotypes. Bodyguard (BDG) has been identified as playing a major role in cutin biosynthesis, and an orthologue of this gene was found to be up-regulated in the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype compared with the low retention genotype. Interestingly, a MYB16 transcription factor was found to be down-regulated in the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype during early fruit development. The orthologue of this gene has been shown to be involved in the regulation of cuticle development, along with WAX INDUCER/SHINE1 (WIN1/SHN1) in A. thaliana. Thus, it could be expected that this gene would be up-regulated in the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype, as these fruits had a thicker fruit cuticle compared with the low carotenoid retention genotype. However, WIN1/SHN1 orthologues were not found to be differentially expressed in pepper. Two genes were annotated as ECERIFERUM1 CER1 in the pepper Sol Genomics Network and, interestingly, they displayed differences in expression between the medium/high and low retention genotypes. CA09G18740 was shown to be up-regulated in the medium/high retention line at anthesis +45 d, whilst CA12G22670, also annotated as CER1, was shown to be down-regulated in the medium/high retention genotype in ripe fruits. CER1 is involved in reduction and decarbonylation of the very long chain fatty acids to cuticular alkanes. A cytochrome P450 enzyme designated midchain alkane hydroxylase (MAH1) is involved in the oxidation of alkanes to secondary alcohols and ketones in Arabidopsis. MAH1 genes were found to be up-regulated in the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype compared with the low carotenoid retention genotype throughout fruit development (Table 2).The differentially expressed genes involved in cuticle biosynthesis between the medium/high and low carotenoid retention genotypes provide further evidence that the carotenoid retention phenotype is controlled, in part, by the structure of the fruit surface.Upon enzymatic isolation of exocarp discs from pepper fruit, it was observed that the red pigment was retained within the wax exocarp tissue, despite the removal of all other pericarp tissue (Fig. 4A). It was consequently hypothesized that carotenoids may be located within the epidermal cells found in the isolated exocarp layer. The waxy exocarp layer penetrated several cell layers deep within the fruit, particularly in genotypes R6 and R8; these carotenoids may remain within the exocarp due to the protective nature of this layer. A comparison was made with tomato fruit exocarp discs, but the red pigment observed in pepper exocarp discs was not present in tomato discs (Supplementary Fig. S3).Carotenoids were isolated from exocarp discs by sequential chloroform and methanol washes over a period of 3 d. HPLC analysis was used to quantify carotenoids extracted from exocarp discs. These values were then compared with the carotenoid amounts extracted from whole fruit discs, and results were expressed as a ratio (Fig. 4B). This approach allowed the quantity of exocarp-bound carotenoids to be compared in a relative manner with the whole-fruit carotenoid content, regardless of variations in total fruit carotenoid content between the genotypes.Interestingly, significant differences were only observed in the ratio of capsanthin and capsanthin esters between the genotypes analysed. This suggests that these carotenoids may be responsible for causing the observed red colour of exocarp discs in these genotypes. A significantly greater exocarp to whole fruit ratio for capsanthin diesters was observed in the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype, R8, relative to the three other genotypes analysed (Fig. 4B). This trend was further reflected in total carotenoid content when comparing R8 (medium/high retention) with the other genotypes analysed (Fig. 4B).The fruit surface structure has been demonstrated to be associated with the carotenoid retention phenotype; it was hypothesized that the fruit surface may be crucial in protecting against carotenoid degradation. Cracks were not observed on the surface of medium/high carotenoid retention fruits. Therefore, it could be postulated that the fruit surface may provide a protective barrier against oxidative degradation of carotenoids.Pepper fruits were treated with H2O2, as an oxidative agent, to determine the role of the fruit surface in protecting against carotenoid degradation. Fruits were harvested when ripe; control fruits were treated with varying concentrations of H2O2 immediately following harvest, and were oven dried and stored for 4 weeks.Following post-harvest storage, a decrease in total carotenoid content was observed in the low carotenoid retention genotype, R3, peppers treated with 2 mM H2O2 before drying when compared with peppers treated with 0 mM H2O2 (Fig. 5A), at which point the cuticle remained smooth and exhibited no cracks. No decrease was observed in peppers treated with 0.2 mM H2O2 before drying. In contrast, R3 peppers treated with both 0.2 mM and 2 mM H2O2 after fruit drying displayed decreases in total carotenoid content (Fig. 5B) compared with peppers treated with 0 mM H2O2 at this time point. Fruits treated with H2O2 following drying were more susceptible to carotenoid degradation when a lower concentration (0.2 mM) H2O2 was used. After drying, the fruit surface displayed cracking; this structural alteration could have facilitated the entrance of oxidative species into the fruit and promoted carotenoid degradation.The medium/high carotenoid retention genotype, R8, displayed no difference in total carotenoid content, regardless of the H2O2 concentration used (Fig. 5A, B). This was observed in fruits treated both before and after fruit drying. The fruit surface remained smooth in the R8 genotype (medium/high retention) and intact following drying, suggesting a protective barrier was in place to limit the entry of oxidative species into the fruit.","The retention of colour during post-harvest storage is an important quality trait for ripe chilli pepper fruit.The major carotenoid conferring red colour in chilli peppers is capsanthin, whilst other xanthophylls such as violaxanthin, neoxanthin, and antheraxanthin, along with β-carotene, are also present in fruits. Whilst carotenoid content in harvested pepper fruit has been studied previously, the change in carotenoid content during post-harvest storage, defined as carotenoid retention, has been understudied to date. Identification of genotypes which retain high levels of carotenoids is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this trait. The study presented here has demonstrated that pepper genotypes can retain carotenoids to different extents following post-harvest storage (Table 1). Interestingly, some pepper fruit genotypes showed an increase in carotenoid content during post-harvest storage, including genotypes R5 and R6, which showed carotenoid increases of 48% and 24%, respectively, following oven drying. This increase in carotenoids during post-harvest storage has previously been observed in pepper varieties, and it has been postulated that biosynthesis can proceed during post-harvest storage. In addition to carotenoid pigments, the measure of colour can encompass several other parameters. The inclusion of image analysis data in the classification of genotypes has added to the robustness and contextual interpretation of the present data.Carotenoid retention is a key quality trait not only in pepper, but also in other crop species. Carotenoid losses during post-harvest storage are well reported in a variety of crop species, and this affects both the colour quality and nutritional quality. Elevated carotenoid content has been engineered in a variety of crop plants, including rice, maize, and cassava. Whilst these studies have been successful in engineering elevated carotenoid content and, consequently, increased provitamin A capacity in these crops, significant challenges have been encountered due to the fact that these crops do not retain these carotenoids during post-harvest storage.The cuticle of fruit species has been acknowledged as a modulator of post-harvest quality, influencing the shelf-life potential of fruit crops. This study proposes the pepper fruit surface, and specifically the fruit cuticle, as a key structural feature in protecting the fruit against carotenoid losses during post-harvest storage. The carotenoid retention phenotype is associated with the fruit surface structure of pepper, which was noted because genotypes characterized as low carotenoid retention tended to show a ‘wrinkled’ or ‘cracked’ fruit surface upon fruit post-harvest drying, whilst genotypes characterized as high carotenoid retention tended to show a smooth fruit surface upon drying (Figs 1, 2). Ferulic acid has previously been demonstrated to be associated with suberin deposition in melon fruits. Suberin deposition occurs in response to wounding, to seal the compromised tissue. Interestingly, high levels of ferulic acid were observed in genotype R4, which further displayed wrinkling upon drying. Consequently, the high levels of ferulic acid, which are precursors for suberin, could be associated with cracking of the fruit surface, which involves suberin deposition.Upon further inspection of the fruit surface using light microscopy, it was noted that pepper genotypes with a smooth surface also possessed a thicker fruit exocarp. The exocarp described here consisted of a lipidic layer in which cells were embedded (Fig. 2). The fruit cuticle is normally localized only on the outer surface of epidermal cells; however, in some genotypes studied here, this lipid layer penetrates several cell layers deep within the fruit, and is consequently termed the ‘exocarp’. Microscopic analysis of the tomato cultivar M82 revealed a small amount of subepidermal cuticular material deposition; however, this did not appear to penetrate multiple cell layers deep into the fruit as presented here in the case of chilli pepper fruits. The cuticular layer has been reported to surround more than a single cell layer below the outermost epidermis in Ailsa Craig tomatoes; however, deposition of cuticular components penetrating below the epidermal cell layer has not been widely reported to the extent demonstrated in this study in pepper fruits. Genotypes possessing a smooth surface tended to have more layers of cells embedded within this lipid layer. A resistance to cuticle cracking has previously been demonstrated to correlate with a thicker fruit cuticle in the case of cherry tomato.The cuticle is composed of two components: a cutin-rich section and embedded cuticular lipophilic components. Here, increased total cutin monomer content, along with an increase in specific cutin monomers, for example 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid, were shown to be correlated with the high carotenoid retention trait in pepper fruits (Fig. 3). In contrast, cuticular wax content was not shown to be associated with the carotenoid retention phenotype (Fig. 3). This indicates that the thicker exocarp consisted of a cutin matrix, which may be supported by the finding that the tomato cd1 mutant, which presents a deficiency in cutin, displayed a significantly thinner cuticular layer with less subepidermal deposits than the M82 control. These findings suggest that the subepidermal deposits observed in the M82 tomato, and in the pepper genotypes presented here, are largely comprised of cutin. Cuticular waxes showed no association with exocarp thickness, or with the carotenoid retention trait, and this may be due to their localization to the outermost layer of the fruit surface. Further, total cuticular waxes have been shown not to correlate with water loss rate in a diverse pepper collection. This indicates that cuticle waxes may not play a critical role in traits influenced by the fruit cuticle structure, as demonstrated by their lack of correlation to water loss rate, or to the carotenoid retention trait.The cutin matrix penetrates several cell layers deep within the fruit pericarp in the form of subepidermal deposits; this suggests that subepidermal cell layers, along with epidermal cells, may synthesize cuticular components. Previous identification of attached and detached subepidermal globules in the tomato M82 cuticle raised questions regarding the mechanism responsible for depositing cuticular material in subepidermal layers. Two hypotheses were presented: (i) subepidermal cuticular material is derived from epidermal cells and trafficked into subepidermal walls; or (ii) subepidermal cells, along with epidermal cells, synthesize small amounts of cuticular components. The data presented here may support the second of these two hypotheses, in that subepidermal cells can synthesize cuticular components, as a significant trafficking network would be required to explain the depth to which cuticular components penetrate the fruit pericarp in some of the pepper genotypes described in this study. Cuticle precursor transport is not entirely understood; however, data presented here suggest that the claim that epidermal cells are responsible for cuticle synthesis and transport may need to be reconsidered.The differential expression of cuticle biosynthesis genes between the medium/high and low carotenoid retention pepper genotypes supports the finding that the fruit surface structure is associated with the carotenoid retention phenotype. Gene products identified previously as involved in pepper cuticle biosynthesis were amongst those identified as differentially expressed gene transcripts between the medium/high and low carotenoid retention genotypes. Several genes involved in the biosynthesis of A. thaliana cuticle were found to have orthologues in pepper, which were differentially expressed between the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype, with a thick exocarp (Table 2), and the low carotenoid retention genotype, which possessed a thinner fruit exocarp. An orthologue of the BDG, known in A. thaliana to be involved in cutin biosynthesis, is significantly up-regulated in the medium/high retention genotype fruits. This supports the finding that cutin monomer content is also increased, and that the exocarp is thicker, in this medium/high carotenoid retention genotype (Fig. 2). However, the Cutin Deficient 2 (CD2) gene, which in tomato has been reported to regulate cutin monomer biosynthesis, is up-regulated in the low carotenoid retention pepper genotype. Despite the fact that a cd2 tomato mutant was found to have a 98% decrease in cutin content, suggesting the crucial role of CD2 in regulating cutin biosynthesis in tomato fruit, the same influence of this gene product may not be exerted in pepper. Differential expression of genes involved in cutin monomer transport, including PEC1 and various LTP genes, may indicate that transport of these cuticular components is critical to determining the extent of subepidermal cutin deposits, and consequently exocarp thickness. Increases in these gene products could result in increased subepidermal cutin deposition. Therefore, it would seem that cuticle precursor transport is a critical step in determining cutin content. Several genes encoding components of cuticular wax biosynthesis, such as ECERIFERUM1 (CER1), ECERIFERUM3 (CER3), and the midchain alkane hydroxylase (MAH1), which are involved in alkane formation from very long chain and midchain fatty acid precursors, respectively, were also shown to be differentially expressed. In these cases, differences in gene expression did not correlate with cuticular wax content, potentially suggesting that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are operating. The data also show examples where gene transcript levels do not correlate with previously predicted functional studies; for example, MYB16 is known to be a positive regulator of cuticle development but is down-regulated in R8. These studies were performed in hot pepper accessions of a different species, Capsicum chinese, and, in the case of, low carotenoid (yellow) accessions were studied. Despite this difference, the studies were in agreement that 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid is the dominant cutin monomer and is influential in altering total cutin. In such cases, the effect of the genetic background should be considered. The creation of isogenic lines harbouring the trait could assist in future studies.Overexpression of the tomato MIXTA-like MYB transcription factor gene (SlMX1) has previously been shown to result in increased cuticle deposition in the peel, along with an increase in total fruit carotenoid content. However, the present data showed that homologues of this gene transcript were not found to be differentially expressed between the medium/high and low carotenoid retention pepper genotypes.Interestingly, carotenoids have been shown to be associated with the ripe pepper fruit exocarp. This phenomenon has not previously been observed in pepper, or in other similar fleshy fruit species, such as tomato. The observation of carotenoids within the lipidic exocarp layer following enzymatic degradation of the cell walls suggests that the lipid exocarp layer protects carotenoids from degradation. Consequently, the structure of the lipid exocarp directly influences the carotenoid retention phenotype.Further to this, the ratio of exocarp to whole-fruit capsanthin diester content is significantly greater in the high carotenoid retention genotype, R8, compared with the low genotype, R3. This suggests that the waxy, lipophilic environment of the exocarp favours the storage of more non-polar carotenoids, specifically diesters in this case (Fig. 4). Esterified carotenoids have been shown to be more stable than their non-esterified counterparts, and this may explain the increase in total carotenoid content of these cells in the high retention genotype, as esterified carotenoids are less susceptible to oxidative degradation. Whilst the mechanism by which increased esterified carotenoids are accumulated in these exocarp embedded cells is unknown, one explanation may be that these cells have an increased capacity for storage of carotenoids in subchromoplast organelles, specifically in fibrillar plastoglobuli, which are well documented regarding their role in the sequestration and storage of esterified carotenoids in pepper fruit. An increase in fibrillar structures would facilitate the accumulation of increased pigment levels within the chromoplasts of high carotenoid retention genotypes, as has previously been demonstrated.Carotenoids are localized to cells within exocarp. Spatial localization of carotenoids within outer fruit layers may influence the visual perception of the fruit, and their localization within cells embedded within a lipid layer appears to provide protection against degradation.Treatment of pepper fruits with a cracked surface structure (low carotenoid retention: R3, dried fruits) with H2O2 as an oxidative agent resulted in greater degradation of carotenoids than observed in smooth surface fruits (medium/high carotenoid retention: R8, fresh and dried fruits) (Fig. 5). This was presumably due to the cracked cuticle being more permeable to H2O2, therefore resulting in increased ROS within the fruit responsible for initiating endogenous lipid peroxidation and consequently increased carotenoid degradation. Capsorubin, capsanthin, and capsanthin diesters are well characterized as having high quenching capacity for singlet oxygen and hydroxyl free radicals, but are degraded in the process. Collectively, these data provide further evidence that the fruit surface structure is critical in protecting the fruit from permeation of ROS or their precursors. Upon permeating the cuticle barrier, ROS can initiate lipid peroxidation. Carotenoids acting as cellular antioxidants are then degraded as they dissipate reactive molecular species associated with lipid peroxidation. These findings support those postulated by, whereby altered carotenoid retention is associated with altered fatty acid content, lipid peroxidation, and the dissipation of ROS by carotenoids. The present data now demonstrate the involvement of the fruit surface structure as a means of either preventing or enabling the entry of pro-oxidants into the fruit tissue.In summary, the present study has characterized a panel of chilli pepper accessions displaying altered post-harvest carotenoid/colour retention properties. Although not exclusive, the data imply a contributory role for the fruit surface structure in post-harvest retention of pepper colour. Further studies and the construction of biparental populations and/or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to reveal robust correlations between metabolites, traits, and genetic components. These resources could in the future be used as a strategy to maintain colour/carotenoid retention in crops for improved quality and nutritional quality.",

For the cytotoxic profiles, all compounds evaluated showed moderate andnon-selective activity against both tumor and normal cell lines, where PsQ andPsG were the most active compounds (GI₅₀ values between 5.8 μM to 12.0 μM). Withrespect to their anti-microbial activity the compounds showed good and selectiveactivity against the Gram-positive bacteria, while they did not show activityagainst the Gram-negative bacterium or yeast. PsU, PsQ, PsS, seco-PsK and PsGwere the most active compounds (IC₅₀ 2.9-4.5 μM) against S. aureus and PsG, PsUand seco-PsK showed good activity (IC₅₀ 3.1-3.8 μM) against E. faecalis,comparable to the reference drug vancomycin (4.2 μM).","Correa, Hebelin, Aristizabal, Fabio, Duque, Carmenza, Kerr, Russell",2011,Marine drugs,2,False,False,True,"The discovery of selective and potent therapeutic activity of pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins isolated from the octocoral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae and the high degree of chemical variation among specimens collected at different locations throughout the Caribbean region, have motivated several authors to pursue this field of study. Thus far, 30 pseudopterosins (PsA-Y, iso-PsE, 2-O-Ac-PsQ, 3-O-Ac-PsQ, 2-O-Ac-PsU and 2-O-Ac-PsQ) and 11 seco-pseudopterosins (seco-PsA-K) have been isolated from specimens collected in the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Florida Keys and the Colombian islands of San Andrés and Providencia.The pseudopterosins (PsA-D, PsE, iso-PsE, PsM-O, PsX and PsY) and seco-pseudopterosins (seco-PsA-G) isolated from specimens collected in the North Caribbean Sea (the Bahamas, Bermuda and the Florida Keys) have been evaluated as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antimicrobial agents. Among them, PsN, PsA, iso-PsE and PsE were found to be the most potent compounds in mouse ear anti-inflammatory assays. Furthermore PsA and PsE, appeared to prevent eicosanoid biosynthesis by inhibition of PLA2, 5-LO and COX, degranulation of leukocytes and the consequent liberation of lysosomal enzymes. PsA-E, PsK, PsX, PsY and seco-PsA-D showed excellent and selective activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Pseudopterosins are also used in several skin care products. Methopterosin is a simple derivative of PsA and has completed Phase I and II clinical trials as a wound healing agent.Specimens of P. elisabethae collected in the southwest Caribbean Sea, specifically at the Islands of San Andres and Providencia (Colombia), have been shown to contain new pseudopterosins (PsP-V, 2-O-Ac-PsQ, 3-O-Ac-PsQ, 2-O-Ac-PsU and 2-O-Ac-PsQ, PsG and PsK), seco-pseudopterosins (seco-PsH-K), and an inter-converting mixture of non-glycosylated diterpenes (10-acetoxy-9-hydroxy- and 9-acetoxy-10-hydroxy-amphilecta-8,10,12,14-tetraenes (IMNGD)). However, only a limited number of these compounds has been evaluated for anti-inflammatory, anti-tuberculosis, anti-viral, anti-malarial and anti-cancer activity.In regards to their anti-inflammatory activity, our experiments showed that fractions enriched with pseudopterosins (PsG, PsK, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT and PsU) and seco-pseudopterosins (seco-PsJ and seco-PsK) were able to inhibit the inflammation in a 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-acetate (TPA)-induced edema assay, with results comparable to those shown by indomethacin used as the control standard. Additionally, in in vitro experiments, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU and IMNGD showed good activity for the inhibition of MPO release; PsP, PsT and IMNGD inhibit NO release and PsR inhibited thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and the superoxide anion (O2−).In other experiments, PsP was evaluated for anti-viral activity (against HSV-1, HSV-2, HVMV and VZV), and PsQ, PsR, PsU, PsV, seco-PsH and seco-PsI evaluated as anti-malaria agents (against Plasmodium falciparum) and as anti-tuberculosis agents (against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv). There is only one report discussing the cytotoxic activity of PsQ, PsR, PsU, PsV, and 3-O-acetyl-PsU against MCF-7 (breast cancer), NCI-H460 (non-small-cell lung cancer), and SF-268 (CNS) cells. These data suggest that some of these pseudopterosins have some cytotoxicity but lack potency.While there has been considerable effort towards characterizing the biological activity of pseudopterosins isolated from octocoral samples collected in the northern Caribbean, much is unknown about the bioactivity of such compounds isolated from octocoral collected from the Islands of San Andrés and Providencia. For this reason, and with a goal of expanding the potential of these compounds, here we report for the first time the antimicrobial profile against four pathogen microorganisms (S. aureus, E. faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans) and report a more complete cytotoxic profile against five human cells lines (HeLa, PC-3, HCT116, MCF-7 and BJ) for the compounds: PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU, 3-O-acetyl-PsU, seco-PsJ, seco-PsK and IMNGD (Figure 1).","The following substances were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, USA): Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), staurosporine, vancomycin, penicillin G, gentamicin, nystatin, Luria-Bertani Broth (LB) and Sabouraud Dextrose broth (SD). Fetal bovine serum (FBS), salts for phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and organic solvents, were purchased from WRW (PA, USA).Fragments of individual colonies of P. elisabethae were collected by SCUBA (ca. 20–30 m depth) at Providencia and San Andrés islands (SW Caribbean) and identified by Dr. Monica Puyana. Voucher specimens coded as INV CNI 1612–1616, were deposited at the invertebrate collection of Museo de Historia Natural Marina Colombiana (MHNMC) at Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas de Punta Betín (INVEMAR).The dried colony fragments (30 g) from each location were extracted separately with a dichloromethane-methanol (1:1) mixture. The resulting extracts were filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation to obtain a dark green oil. The isolation of each compound was carried out according to our previously described procedures with some modifications. Each extract was subjected separately to flash C18 column chromatography and eluted with 500 mL of each solvent mixture of decreasing polarity (methanol-water 1:9, fraction F1; methanol-water 1:1, F2; methanol-water 4:1, F3; methanol 100% F4; ethanol 100% 5, F5; acetone 100%, F6; dichloromethane-methanol 5:5, F7; and dichloromethane 100%, F8). Checking by LC-MS and TLC, the fractions F4 and F5 from the Providencia extract contained a mixture of pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins and F5 from the San Andrés extract contained the interconverting mixture of non-glycosylated diterpenes (IMNGD). Fraction F4 and F5 from Providencia were mixed and subsequently separated by flash chromatography using a diol column (150 g) yielding PsG (19.1 mg), PsP (9.6 mg), PsQ (58.1 mg), PsS (2.3 mg), PsT (14.5 mg), PsU (46.6 mg), 3-O-Ac-PsU (3.5 mg), seco-PsJ (16.2 mg) and seco-PsK (1.2 mg). Final purification of all compounds was performed on HPLC, using a column Gemini C-18 (5 μm, 10 × 250 mm) and MeOH-water (9:1) as the mobile phase with a 3.0 mL/min flow rate. The isolated compounds were carefully identified by comparison of their spectral data with that shown by our previously isolated compounds. Purity was confirmed by HPLC and NMR.The cell lines HeLa (cervical cancer), PC-3 (prostate cancer), HCT116 (colorectal cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer) and normal human cell line BJ (skin fibroblasts) were used and maintained in DMEM with 5% of FBS and gentamicin 50 μg/mL. Cultures were held in 75 cm2 culture flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 100% relative humidity, changing media at least twice a week.Cells were harvested, counted, and transferred into 96 well plates and incubated for 24 h prior to the addition of the test compounds. Test sample solutions (10 μL) at the desired dilutions were added to the wells containing the cells and incubated for 48 h. Microtitration colorimetric method of MTT reduction was used to determine surviving cells at the end of the treatment period.A solution of MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was prepared in PBS and 100 μL of this solution was added to each well after the removal of 100 μL of treatment solution. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The solution in each well, containing media, unmetabolized MTT, and dead cells, was removed by suction and 100 μL of DMSO was added to each well. The DMSO was mixed by pipetting and optical density was recorded using a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader to measure the absorbance at 570 nm. Percentages of cell survival relative to vehicle control wells (wells containing only cells and DMSO) were calculated.Stock solutions (5 mg/mL) were prepared by dissolving pure compounds in DMSO and storing at 4 °C. Serial dilutions with culture media were prepared just prior to addition to test plates. The concentration of DMSO in wells was consistent across dilutions at 0.38% v/v. Staurosporine was used as the positive control and vehicle (DMSO + media) as blank. Control and test compounds (PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU, 3-O-Ac-PsU, seco-PsJ, seco-PsK and IMNGD) were assayed in duplicate for each concentration and replicated for each cell line at concentrations of 5000, 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1 nM for staurosporine and 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, and 20.0 μg/mL for compounds.Compounds isolated from P. elisabethae were tested against a panel of microorganisms including the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 375, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10741, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 14210 and the yeast Candida albicans ATCC 14035. Bacterial strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani Broth (LB) and C. albicans was cultured in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SD), for 18 h at 37 °C and 220 rpm in a humidified incubator.The antimicrobial activity was determined by a microdilution method (IC50) in 96-well microtiter plates using LB media for bacteria and SD media for the yeast seeded liquid media. In all cases, a pre-inoculated dilution was made with fresh broth. A volume of 180 μL of each microorganism suspension was inoculated in each well (105 cells/mL) and mixed with 20 μL of treatment solutions. Stock solutions were prepared by dissolving pure compounds and controls in 20% DMSO and storing at 4 °C. Penicillin G (S. aureus), vancomycin (E. faecalis), gentamicin (P. aeruginosa) and nystatin (C. albicans) were used as positive controls and vehicle (DMSO + media) as blank. The final DMSO concentration used for dissolving the extracts was less than 20%. Controls and test compounds (PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU, 3-O-Ac-PsU, seco-PsJ, seco-PsK and IMNGD) were assayed in duplicate for each of the following concentrations: 64.0, 32.0, 16.0, 4.0, 1.0, 0.25 and 0.06 μg/mL.Microplates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and optical density was recorded using a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader to measure the absorbance at 600 nm. For each experiment, correction for background absorbance was made by subtracting the value for OD600 after the compounds were added (time 0 h). Percentages of microorganism survival relative to vehicle control wells (wells containing only microorganism and DMSO) were calculated. The IC50 of the controls were also determined in parallel experiments in order to control for the sensitivity of the standard test organisms.Data were normalized and analyzed using non-linear regression to elucidate IC50 values from sigmoidal dose-response curves. Comparison between cell lines and microorganisms used extra sum-of-squares F test to evaluate IC50 between data sets. P < 0.05 was considered as indicative of significance using GraphPad Software, Prism V. 5.0.","In this study, PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU, 3-O-acetyl-PsU, seco-PsJ, seco-PsK and IMNGD were isolated (Figure 1) by flash chromatography and HPLC and identified by spectroscopic means. The structures of all compounds were previously reported by us, and preliminary assessment of their cytotoxic (Table 1) and antimicrobial (Table 2) properties is presented here.The cytotoxic activity of the pseudopterosins (PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU and 3-O-acetyl-PsU), seco-pseudopterosins (seco-PsJ and seco-PsK) and IMNGD against five cell lines: HeLa (cervical cancer), PC-3 (prostate cancer), HCT116 (colorectal cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer) and BJ (fibroblasts) was investigated using the MTT reduction colorimetric assay. Although no compound showed significant activity, according to the GI50 cut off value of 10 nM for pure compounds suggested by Bugelski et al., all compounds evaluated showed moderate to weak (GI50 5.8–83.9 μM) and non-selective activity against both tumor and normal cell lines as shown in Table 1.While none of these compound showed comparable activity to the reference drug staurosporine (GI50 13.6–105.6 nM) against the four tumor cell lines, PsQ and PsG were the most active compounds (GI50 values between 5.8 μM to 12.0 μM) and IMNGD showed a moderate activity with GI50 values of 9.7–19.9 μg/mL. These results are comparable with those previously reported by Rodriguez et al., who determined the GI50 values for PsQ, PsU and PsV in the NCI-H460-cell line. Results for PsQ showed a GI50 between 1.7–5.8 μM. In the same screen, PsU and PsV were generally much less toxic (GI50 20–100 μM). For the normal cell line BJ (Table 1), PsS, 3-O-acetyl-PsU, PsP, PsT and seco-PsJ did not show a considerable cytotoxic effect (GI50 > 10 μM) while PsQ, PsG, seco-PsK and PsU showed a moderate cytotoxic activity (GI50 4.5–9.3 μM). The IMNGD showed a moderate activity with GI50 of 8.3 μg/mL.The selectivity of the cytotoxic activity of the compounds, measured as the differential effect on growth of different types of cell lines, was made by comparing the effect of the compounds on inhibiting cell growth in both normal and tumor cells. The results showed no selectivity of compounds between the lines used, and all compounds induced reduction in cell survival to a similar magnitude in all lines.Preliminary conclusions regarding structure-activity relationships can be drawn from an examination of the cytotoxic activity. The position of glycosylation on the terpene skeleton appears to affect the inhibitory activity profile as, for example, PsG (glycosylated in C-9 with fucopyranose) is more active than PsP (glycosylated in C-10 with fucopyranose). Further, the type of sugar moiety also influences the activity as, for example, PsP which is glycosylated with fucopyranose is more active than PsT which is glycosylated with arabinopyranose. Likewise, PsQ (C-4’ mono-acetylated fucose as sugar moiety) is more active than PsU (C-4’ mono-acetylated arabinose as sugar moiety) and seco-PsK (non-acetylated fucose as sugar moiety) is more active than seco-PsJ (mono-acetylated arabinose as sugar moiety).The antimicrobial activity of the pseudopterosins, seco-pseudopterosins and IMNGD was investigated against one Gram-negative bacterium (P. aeruginosa), two Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and E. faecalis) and one yeast (C. albicans), using a microdilution method. The majority of compounds evaluated showed a good IC50 (2.9–7.64 μM) and all showed a selective activity against both Gram-positive bacteria tested (Table 2), while they did not show activity against the Gram-negative bacterium or the yeast.PsU, PsQ, PsS, seco-PsK, PsG were the most active compounds (IC50 2.3–4.5 μM) against S. aureus. The IMNGD showed good activity with IC50 of 2.3 μg/mL. For E. faecalis, PsG, PsU and seco-PsK showed better activity (Table 2) compared to the reference drug vancomycin (4.2 μM) while, seco-PsJ and PsT exhibited similar activity. The IMNGD showed good activity, with an IC50 of 3.5 μg/mL. These results are comparable with the activity previously reported for PsA-E, PsK, PsX and PsY isolated from specimens collected in the north Caribbean Sea, which were reported to have minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between 4.2 and 8.8 μM.The selectivity observed in our study is comparable to that reported by Ata et al., who reported that other pseudopterosins (PsA-E, PsK, PsX and PsY) inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (S. pyogenes, S. aureus,and E. faecalis), while they were inactive against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa). This finding can be related to the fact that many Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to toxic agents in the environment, due to the barrier of lipopolysaccharides on their outer membrane.Examination of the data in Table 2 suggests the following structure–activity relationships. Firstly, PsG (glycosylated in C-9 with fucopyranose) is more active than PsP (glycosylated in C-10 with fucopyranose). Secondly, PsT glycosylated with arabinopyranose is more active than PsP, which is glycosylated with fucopyranose. Likewise, PsU (mono-acetylated arabinose as sugar moiety) is more active than PsQ and PsS (mono-acetylated fucose as sugar moiety). However, this behavior initially observed in pseudopterosins (amphilectane skeleton) is not retained when the results are compared with seco-psedopterosins (serrulatane skeleton), where, the seco-PsK (glycosylated with fucoyranose) showed more activity than seco-PsJ (glycosylated with arabinopyranose). Clearly, additional work is required to fully understand the structure–activity relationships for this family of terpenes.From the above discussion, one can note that the pseudopterosins, seco-pseudopterosins and IMNGD isolated from P. elisabethae collected at the Islands of San Andrés and Providencia (southwest Caribbean Sea) have a similar drug-like potential as the related compounds isolated from specimens collected in the north Caribbean Sea (the Bahamas, Bermuda and the Florida Keys). Further, due to their wide applicability in commercial additives, in the cosmetic industry, it might be important to consider P. elisabethae collected in Colombian waters as an alternative source of such compounds. As has been shown, the anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and cytotoxic activity of this family of compounds isolated from P. elisabethae collected at different locations at the Caribbean Sea are quite similar, regardless of a small number of differences in their structure (type of sugar moiety, position of glycosylation and stereochemistry).",,"All results presented here contribute to the demonstration that the compounds isolated from P. elisabethae (SW Caribbean) are promising molecules with potentially useful antimicrobial activity profiles. This confirms that this marine organism has great value as a source of lead compounds with pharmaceutical applications. Specifically, PsU, PsQ, PsS, seco-PsK and PsG are the most promising anti-bacterial agents. For this reason, it will be interesting to continue with molecular targeted high-throughput screens in order to understand their mechanism of action."

Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)is a biomarker for gastric cancer and is involved in cancer stemness. By inducingcancer stemness in various types of cancer, the polarization of macrophages intotumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) controls tumor progression. Betulinic acid(BA) is a bioactive natural compound with anticancer properties. However, whetherGRP78 regulates TAM-mediated cancer stemness in the tumor microenvironment andwhether BA inhibits GRP78-mediated cancer stemness in gastric cancer remainunknown. In this study, we investigated the role of GRP78 in gastric cancerstemness in a tumor microenvironment regulated by BA. The results indicated thatBA inhibited not only GRP78-mediated stemness-related protein expression andGRP78-TGF-β-mediated macrophage polarization into TAMs, but also TAM-mediatedcancer stemness. Therefore, BA is a promising candidate for clinical applicationin combination-chemotherapy targeting cancer stemness.","Chen, Jen-Lung, Tai, Yun-Shen, Tsai, Hsin-Yi, Hsieh, Chia-Yuan, Chen, Chun-Lin, Liu, Chung-Jung, Wu, Deng-Chyang, Huang, Yaw-Bin, Lin, Ming-Wei",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"The therapeutic efficacy of gastric cancer treatment has remained limited because cancer cells acquire stemness through self-renewal. Previous studies have indicated that cancer stemness plays an essential role in chemoresistance and tumor recurrence. Gastric cancer stem cells express high levels of the surface marker CD44 and the stemness-related transcription factor OCT4. These CD44+ gastric cancer cells are invasive and resistant to chemotherapy. CD44 interaction with OCT4 signaling plays a critical role in the acquisition of cancer stem-cell properties, including chemoresistance, in cancer cells. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperon that produces an adaptive response in order to promote cell survival under stress. This protein has been identified as a human gastric-cancer biomarker and has been linked to gastric cancer stem cell-like characteristics, stemness-related protein expression, and cancer-associated fibroblast activation in the tumor microenvironment. However, the role in GRP78-mediated cancer stemness undertaken by other cells, particularly macrophages, in the tumor microenvironment remains under investigation.Generally, M1/M2 macrophage polarization regulates the progression of tumors in various cancers. M1 macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are regarded as antitumor macrophages, whereas M2-polarized macrophages expressing arginase 1 (Arg1) modulate cancer-related activities, including cancer stemness. To promote cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance, cancer cells induce macrophage M2 phenotype polarization in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) secreted by cancer cells or the tumor microenvironment promotes the differentiation of nonactivated macrophages into a tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotype while suppressing proinflammatory M1 phenotypes. This positive feedback, generated by TGF-β loops, drives the polarization of macrophages toward the protumor TAM phenotype. Additionally, the modeling of macrophage polarization influences the efficacy of cancer treatment. Therefore, inhibition of TGF-β-induced macrophage polarization is essential for TAM-induced chemoresistance related to cancer stemness.Betulinic acid (BA) is a bioactive pentacyclic triterpenoid present in white birch. Although some studies have reported that BA exhibits anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties and can be used to treat neglected tropical diseases, only a few studies have investigated the antiproliferative and migration effects of BA against gastric cancer cells. In addition, the ability of BA to regulate the tumor microenvironment by modulating TAM polarization and gastric cancer stemness remains unclear.Cancer stemness is a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment. Both cancer stemness targeting and combined chemotherapy may assist in inhibiting tumor growth and preventing cancer recurrence. In this study, we examined the stemness of human gastric cancer cells at molecular level and the regulation of GRP78/TGF-β1-mediated TAM polarization and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion by BA. We then investigated the inhibitory effect of IL-6 reduction on gastric-cancer cell stemness.","An AGS human gastric cancer cell line (CRL-1739) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). AGS cells were maintained in an RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. AGS/NC (shLacZ, clone ID: TRCN231722), AGS/GRP78-OE (GRP78-Bip-pLAS2w cloning vector), and AGS/sh-GRP78 (shHSPA5, clone ID: TRCN218611) were purchased from the National RNAi Core Facility (RNA Technology Platform and Gene Manipulation Core, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan). Transfected AGS cells were cultured in an RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) containing 10% FBS and 1.5 μg/mL puromycin under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. A RAW 264.7 monocyte/macrophage-like cell line (TIB-71) was purchased from the ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Stock solutions of BA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich) in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared and dissolved in the culture medium before treatment. Recombinant human TGF-β1 (GFH39-5; Cell Guidance Systems, Cambridge, UK) and recombinant human IL-6 (CYT-1150; ProSpec, East Brunswick, NJ, USA) were prepared and dissolved in the culture medium before treatment.Human gastric cancer cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Total protein samples were then extracted, and protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal quantities of total proteins were separated using Bolt Bis-Tris Plus 4–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Thermo Fisher Scientific, New York, NY, USA) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After the membranes were washed with PBS and Tween 20, they were then blocked with a blocking buffer (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies GRP78 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), OCT4 (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), β-actin (1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology), TGF-β1 (1:1000; Abcam), Smad2/3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), Arg1 (1:1000; Proteintech, Martinsried, Planegg, Germany), iNOS (1:1000; Abcam), STAT3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 °C. Finally, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h and analyzed using an electrochemiluminescence detection system.Conditioned medium was obtained from AGS treated with BA or from AGS/NC, AGS/sh-GRP78, or AGS/GRP78-OE treated with SB431542. The TGF-β1 level was then determined using a TGF-β1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Abcam) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.Conditioned medium was obtained from RAW 264.7 cells treated with TGF-β1 or from AGS/NC or AGS/GRP78-OE treated with SB431542. The IL-6 level was then determined using an IL-6 ELISA kit (Abcam) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.To generate conditioned media from AGS/NC, AGS/GRP78-OE, or AGS/GRP78-OE treated with SB431542 (GRP78-OE+SB), gastric cancer cells (2 × 106) were seeded in 10 cm dishes and cultured in a medium containing 1% FBS for 2 days before being washed. A fresh nonconditioned medium was then added, and the gastric cancer cells were cultured for 24 h. Subsequently, the medium conditioned by gastric cancer cells was filtered, evaluated using ELISA, and used with RAW 264.1 cells. To evaluate the polarization of macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells were incubated in a tumor-conditioned medium for 2 days and then washed. A fresh nonconditioned medium was then added, and the RAW 264.7 cells were cultured for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were analyzed using Western blotting, and the medium conditioned by RAW 264.7 was filtered, evaluated using ELISA, and used with AGS cells. To evaluate the stemness of gastric cancer cells, AGS cells were incubated in a macrophage-conditioned medium for 2 days, and cancer stemness was analyzed using Western blotting and flow cytometry 2 days thereafter.After treatment, the cells were washed with cold PBS and stained for 45 min with a surface marker antibody. After being stained, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS before analysis. Flow cytometry was then used to evaluate the expression of CSC markers (CD44; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) on human gastric cancer cells.All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software, version 8, San Diego, CA, USA). The results are presented as mean ± SEM. Significance calculated from Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA analysis was set at p < 0.05.","GRP78 is involved in the expression of TGF-β and the stemness of gastric cancer cells. However, whether BA inhibits GRP78 to regulate stemness and TGF-β remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed that BA downregulates the expression of GRP78 in human gastric-cancer AGS cells (Figure 1A,B). To determine whether BA inhibits gastric cancer-cell stemness through a GRP78-TGF-β-mediated pathway, we evaluated TGF-β1 and the expression of the stemness-related transcription factor OCT4 in AGS cells after BA treatment. The results indicated that BA inhibited TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling, TGF-β1 secretion, and OCT4 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C–E). Similar results were also observed in MKN45, another human gastric cancer cell line (Figure 1F–J). OCT4 is a key regulator that maintains the pluripotency and self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Knockdown of the cell surface stemness marker CD44 suppresses stem cell-like properties by downregulating OCT4. In addition, TGF-β1 promotes the growth of CD44+ populations in AGS, and the TGF-β inhibitor SB431542 reverses the TGF-β1-induced increase in CD44+ cells (Figure 1K,L). These findings indicate that GRP78 and TGF-β are involved in the expression of stemness-related markers in BA-treated human gastric cancer AGS cells (Supplementary Material).In colon cancer, GRP78 overexpression promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition through autocrine TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling. According to previous studies, TGF-β1 promotes the expression of the pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 and cancer stemness characteristics. In this study, to determine whether GRP78 regulates the expression of the TGF-β1-mediated stemness marker OCT4 in human gastric cancer, we evaluated the expression of TGF-β1 and OCT4 in AGS cells with GRP78 overexpression and knockdown by using Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicated that the GRP78 level in AGS cells regulated the expression of TGF-β1 and OCT4 (Figure 2A–F). In addition, TGF-β1 activated the Smad2/3 signaling pathway and regulated the transcription process through both Smad2 and Smad3. Smad2/3 downregulation also enhanced the suppression of OCT4. These findings indicate that GRP78 and BA regulate the activation of Smad2/3 (Figure 2G–J), suggesting that BA may regulate the expression of the human gastric-cancer stemness marker OCT4 through the GRP78-TGF-β1-Smad2/3 signaling pathway.Generally, TAMs facilitate tumor progression, and TGF-β, which is secreted by cancer cells, promotes the differentiation of macrophages into M2-like TAMs. As depicted in Figure 1A–C, BA regulated the expression of TGF-β1 in gastric cancer cells, confirming that TGF-β1 plays a role in macrophage polarization. As indicated in Figure 3A–D, TGF-β1 induced macrophages to express the M2-type marker Arg1 and downregulated the expression of the M1-type marker iNOS. In addition, IL-6 derived from TAMs increased the CSC population, and TGF-β1 regulated the expression of IL-6 in macrophages (Figure 3D).To determine whether GRP78-expressing gastric cancer cells regulate macrophage polarization through the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, macrophages were treated with either a conditioned medium containing GRP78-overexpressing gastric cancer cells or a conditioned medium containing the TGF-β1 receptor inhibitor SB431542. NC, GRP78-OE, and GRP78-OE AGS cells treated with SB431542 were then cultured for 48 h. As shown in Figure 4A, which depicts macrophage polarization assays, the cells were washed, placed in a fresh medium containing 1% FBS, and cultured for 24 h to generate a cancer cell-conditioned medium (shown in pink). RAW 264.7 cells were then incubated for 48 h in the cancer-conditioned medium. The medium was subsequently removed, and the macrophages were cultured in a fresh medium for 24 h to generate a macrophage-conditioned medium (shown in yellow). The IL-6 concentration in the macrophage-conditioned medium was then analyzed using ELISA. After 48 h of incubation in the macrophage-conditioned medium, the AGS cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. The results indicated that the conditioned medium with GRP78-overexpressing gastric cancer cells promoted the expression of the TAM/M2 marker Arg1 and suppressed the expression of the M1 marker iNOS in macrophages. In addition, SB431542, a TGF-β1 receptor inhibitor, reversed the TAM-type promotion effects, indicating that the GRP78-overexpressing gastric cancer cells promoted TAM-type macrophages through the TGF-β1 signaling pathway (Figure 4B–D). Generally, IL-6 derived from TAMs is a potent inducer that enriches CSC populations. In this study, IL-6 levels were increased in macrophages treated with a conditioned medium containing GRP78-OE and decreased in GRP78-OE containing SB431542 (Figure 4E), indicating that gastric cancer induced macrophage IL-6 elevation through the GRP78-TGF-β1 pathway.The results confirmed that GRP78-overexpressing gastric cancer cells induced macrophage IL-6 expression and that the conditioned medium containing macrophages (Figure 4A) enriched the CD44+ gastric CSC population through the TGF-β1 signaling pathway (Figure 5A,B). IL-6 is a TAM-produced cytokine that is involved in tumor progression and metastasis through the STAT3 signaling pathway and is responsible for the prosurvival adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia. In this study, macrophage-derived IL-6 was regulated by the GRP78-mediated secretion of TGF-β1 in gastric cancer cells. As shown in Figure 5C–H, IL-6 activated the STAT3 signaling pathway and induced cancer stemness by upregulating the expression of OCT4 and CD44 in gastric cancer cells.","Chemotherapy is the primary treatment method for solid cancers. However, M2-like TAMs secrete cytokines that promote tumor aggressiveness and cancer stemness through epithelial–mesenchymal transition. TAM-derived IL-6 induces tumorigenic and invasive effects and promotes breast, colorectal, and hepatocellular cancer or gastric tumor chemoresistance through the STAT3 signaling pathway. In non-small-cell lung cancer, IL-10 derived from M2 macrophages promotes cancer stemness through the JAK1/STAT1/NF-κB/Notch1 pathway. In addition, TAM-induced IGF promotes thyroid cancer stemness and metastasis by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and TGF-β induces M2-like macrophage polarization. Therefore, the suppression of macrophage polarization into M2-like TAMs in the tumor microenvironment may inhibit TAM-derived IL-6-induced cancer stemness.Small natural compounds, including BA, are potential candidates for combined therapy. Overall, this research has demonstrated the importance of GRP78-mediated cancer stemness in gastric cancer. Generally, the stemness of gastric cancer can be identified by analyzing the expression of cell surface markers (CD44) or stemness-related transcriptional factors (OCT4). In addition, pluripotency proteins are co-expressed by CD44+ cells, and OCT4 participates in self-renewal and chemoresistance and may represent the stemness of gastric cancer. In accordance with our findings, we suggest that BA may regulate the microenvironment of gastric tumors to eliminate cancer stemness by downregulating the stemness-related transcription factor OCT4. The results revealed that GRP78 regulated the expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-β1-mediated stemness in human gastric cancer cells and that TGF-β1 derived from gastric cancer cells promoted macrophage polarization and IL-6 secretion. In addition, IL-6 stimulated gastric cancer stemness by activating the STAT3 signaling pathway and upregulating the stemness-related marker OCT4. Moreover, BA dose-dependently inhibited the GRP78-mediated secretion of TGF-β, thereby suppressing macrophage polarization, IL-6 secretion, and IL-6-mediated gastric cancer stemness (Figure 6). In a previous study, TGF-β signaling was reported to involve a positive feedback loop in the regulation of triple-negative breast cancer and macrophage-mediated cancer stemness and progression. The results also indicated that BA-induced downregulation of TGF-β through the GRP78-mediated pathway may inhibit the positive feedback loop between gastric cancer cells and macrophage-mediated cancer stemness and tumor progression.In addition to inducing GRP78/TGF-β-mediated IL-6 expression, BA may directly inhibit the secretion of IL-6 by modulating NF-κB in mononuclear cells. BA may target both cancer cells and macrophages to suppress cancer stemness in the tumor microenvironment.","Targeting cancer stemness in gastric tumors by using natural compounds may be an effective treatment option for patients with gastric cancer. BA inhibits gastric cancer stemness by regulating GRP78/TGF-β1 in gastric cancer cells, TAM polarization, and macrophage-derived IL-6 signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, BA is regarded as a promising reagent in clinical combination therapy."

Compound **2** was obtained as an optically active ([α] <sup>25</sup> D = −55, *c* = 0.10, CH3OH) yellow gummy solid with molecular formula C21H32O9, as established by HR-ESIMS. The <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum, which was interpreted taking into account data from the 2D NMR HSQC and HMBC experiments, indicated the presence of one ester carbonyl (δ<sup>C</sup> 178.7); two olefinic carbons (δ<sup>C</sup> 129.4 and 133.9); one anomeric carbon (δ<sup>C</sup> 98.7); seven additional oxygenated methines (δ<sup>C</sup> 83.1, 81.4, 76.7, 76.5, 73.5, 70.3 and 65.9); one oxygenated unprotonated carbon (δ<sup>C</sup> 61.8); one oxygenated methylene (δ<sup>C</sup> 61.4); and eight additional sp<sup>3</sup> carbons, including two methines, three methylenes, and three methyls (Table [1\\)](#page-3-0). Accordingly, the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of **2** (Table [1\\)](#page-3-0) showed a *sp*<sup>2</sup> methine signal at δ<sup>H</sup> 5.56, a series of oxymethine and oxymethylene protons between δ<sup>H</sup> 4.37 and 3.17, and three methyl signals, namely a deshielded singlet at δ<sup>H</sup> 1.76, a singlet at δ<sup>H</sup> 1.36, and a doublet at δ<sup>H</sup> 1.27. These data were indicative of the sesquiterpene lactone glycoside nature for compound **2**, whose structure was assigned on the basis of a detailed inspection of the 2D NMR correlations and comparison with data of known compounds [\\[12\\]](#page-8-15). In particular, the COSY spectrum of **2** revealed the presence of three spin systems, namely (i) from the sp<sup>2</sup> methine H-1 to H2-3, (ii) from H-5 to H-9 including the H-11/H3-13 branching, and (iii) the sugar spin system (H-1<sup>0</sup> to H2-6<sup>0</sup> ). The sugar unit was assigned as a β-D-glucopyranoside on the basis of the coupling constant H-1<sup>0</sup> /H-2<sup>0</sup> (*J* = 7.5 Hz) and acid hydrolysis of **2**, which afforded the free sugar unit, identified as D-glucose through co-TLC and optical rotation sign. The HMBC correlations of **2** were instrumental to join the above deduced fragments. In particular, 3 *J* cross-peaks of H3-14 with C-1, C-9, and the unprotonated sp<sup>2</sup> C-10 and of H3-15 with C-3, C-4, and C-5 indicated the presence of the ten-membered ring. Moreover, cross-peaks of both H-6 and H3-13 with the ester carbonyl carbon C-12 indicated the presence of the lactone ring. The linkage of the D-glucopyranose moiety at position 9 was indicated by the <sup>3</sup> *J* HMBC correlation of H-1<sup>0</sup> (δ<sup>H</sup> 4.10) with C-9 (δ<sup>C</sup> 83.1). The presence of an epoxyde ring at C-4/C5, which accounted for the remaining unsaturation degree, was in perfect agreement with the NMR resonances of the involved carbons (C-4 = 61.8 ppm and C-5 = 65.9 ppm). The NOESY correlations were, then, used to deduce the relative configuration of compound **2**. In particular, NOESY cross-peak of H-1 with H3-14 indicated the *Z* configuration of the endocyclic double bond. The relative configuration of the five consecutive stereogenic centers (C-4 to C-11) was deduced on the basis of the following NOESY correlations: H3-15/H-6, H-5/H-7, H2-3/H-5, and H-7/H3-13. Finally, the NOESY cross-peak of H-7 with H-9 pointed to the α-orientation of both protons. Thus, compound **2** was identified as the new 1Z-9β-hydroxyparthenolide-9-*O*-β-D-glucopyranoside. The ∆ 1,10 -*E* isomer of **2** has been recently isolated from *Asteriscus graveolens* [\\[25\\]](#page-8-16) and, accordingly, its reported <sup>13</sup>C NMR resonances for C-1 and C-10 showed significant differences as compared with those of **2**. Both compounds **1** and **2** are close analogues of sesquiterpenoids previously isolated from the same species and we have assumed that they share the absolute configuration of their co-occurring analogues. The isolated metabolites (**1–9**) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Tables [2](#page-4-0) and [3\\)](#page-5-0). Compounds **1**–**3** showed antifungal activities against human pathogenic fungi, with a growth inhibitory activity around 80% at 50 µg mL−<sup>1</sup> against *Candida albicans* and *C. parapsilosis,* respectively. The respective minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of **1**–**3** were 0.21, 0.26, and 0.38 µg mL−<sup>1</sup> against *C. albicans* and 0.25, 0.31, and 0.34 against *C. parapsilosis*. This finding is in agreement with our previously reported results on antifungal activity of guaianolide sesquiterpenoids [\\[26\\]](#page-8-17). In addition, **1–3** also showed activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria with MIC ranging from 2.3 to 6.3 µg mL−<sup>1</sup> (Table [3\\)](#page-5-0). Chlorogenic acid (**4**), a non-sesquiterpenoid, showed a significant inhibition against pathogenic fungi (Table [2\\)](#page-4-0) and strong antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria *E. xiangfangensis* and *E. fergusonii*. Ester derivatives **6** and **7** showed neither antifungal nor antibacterial activity at 25 µg mL−<sup>1</sup> . <span id=""page-4-0""></span> | Compound     | Growth Inhibition<br>(%, mean ±<br>SD)

']nan","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.",,"['**4. conclusions** This investigation on the Saudi Arabia plant *A. garcinii* yielded two additional members of the sesquiterpene lactone class, a new guaianolide, anticipated as precursor of garcinamine E, and a new parthenolide glycoside. Both of these compounds have been evidenced to have a significant antifungal activity, complementing that which had already been revealed for previously isolated congeners of the same family. Therefore, this study clearly evidences the potential of even a single plant to provide a countless list of bioactive phytochemicals and, more in general, of the Saudi Arabian flora to enrich the global phytochemical effort.

30,TA042435,10.3390/molecules27217215,Microplastic-Free Microcapsules to Encapsulate Health-Promoting Limonene Oil.,"Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry has long included many appealingessential oils in products to meet consumers' needs. Among all, the demand forlimonene (LM) has recently surged due to its broad-spectrum health benefits, withapplications in cosmetic, detergent, and food products. However, LM is extremelyvolatile, hence has often been encapsulated for a longer shelf-life. To date,mostly non-biodegradable synthetic polymers have been exploited to fabricate themicrocapsule shells, and the resulting microcapsules contribute to theaccumulation of microplastic in the environment. So far, information onLM-entrapping microcapsules with a natural microplastic-free shell and theirmechanism of formation is limited, and there is lack of an in-depthcharacterisation of their mechanical and adhesive properties, which are crucialfor understanding their potential performance at end-use applications. Thepresent research aims towards developing safe microcapsules with a core of LMfabricated via complex coacervation (CC) using gum Arabic (GA) and fungallysourced chitosan (fCh) as shell precursors. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) forLM was quantified by gas chromatography (GC) separation method. The morphology ofmicrocapsules was investigated via bright-field optical microscopy and scanningelectron microscopy, and their mechanical properties were characterised using amicromanipulation technique. Moreover, the adhesive properties of the resultingmicrocapsules were studied via a bespoke microfluidic device fitted with apolyethylene-terephthalate (PET) substrate and operating at increasinglyhydrodynamic shear stress (HSS). Spherical core-shell microcapsules (EE ~45%)with a mean size of 38 ± 2 μm and a relatively smooth surface were obtained.Their mean rupture force and nominal rupture stress were 0.9 ± 0.1 mN and 2.1 ±0.2 MPa, respectively, which are comparable to those of other microcapsules withsynthetic shells, e.g., urea- and melamine-formaldehyde. It was also found thatthe fCh-GA complexed shell provided promising adhesive properties onto PET films,leading to a microcapsule retention of ~85% and ~60% at low (≤50 mPa) and highshear stress (0.9 Pa), respectively. Interestingly, these values are similar tothe adhesion data available in literature for microplastic-based microcapsules,such as melamine-formaldehyde (50-90%). Overall, these findings suggest thatmicroplastics-free microcapsules with a core of oil have been successfullyfabricated, and can offer a potential for more sustainable, consumer- andenvironmentally friendly applications in FMCGs.","Baiocco, Daniele, Zhang, Zhibing",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"Limonene (LM) is one of the most available hydrophobic monocyclic monoterpenes in the vegetable kingdom. As with other phytochemicals, it naturally occurs in many blends of essential oils (EOs), which provides them with an agreeable piny-lemon turpentine-like scent. Over the years, its proven harmlessness for humans and potential health promoting properties have brought LM towards increasingly high acceptance, especially for applications in cosmetics and pharma-nutraceutical formulations, as well as agri-food & beverage. Specifically, LM’s pleasant odour has long been playing a crucial role in perfume and personal care products. Similarly, LM has been extensively exploited as food & beverage aid by manufacturers to boost consumers’ satisfaction towards building their lifelong relationship. More importantly, LM provides not only a delightful sensation, but also has demonstrated broad-spectrum therapeutic benefits encompassing anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, anti-hyperalgesic, immunomodulatory, antinociceptive, anticancer, antigenotoxicity, antidiabetic, antiviral, antiallergic, antimicrobial and gastroprotective effects. Moreover, LM has demonstrated herbicidal and anthelmintic activities, hence may offer a novel, safer and greener bio-alternative to highly popular synthetic pesticides, which are typically delivered using non-degradable microplastic-based carriers. However, some limitations are associated with LM due to its extreme volatility and thermo-chemical instability. LM is prone to evaporating and may easily undergo degradation/autoxidation when exposed to hostile environment, such as heat, oxygen, and light. Therefore, LM has often been encapsulated to circumvent such shortcomings, hence achieving a longer shelf-life of products containing LM itself. To date, researchers have mainly focused on using non-biodegradable synthetic polymers to fabricate the microcapsule shells, such as highly performing melamine-formaldehyde,, but the resulting microcapsules contribute to the accumulation of persistent microplastic in the environment. Recently, animal-based ingredients, such as seafood-derived chitosan and bovine/swine gelatine, have proven effective to form the microcapsule shells around emulsified LM droplets. More specifically, researchers have investigated the potential of animal sourced chitosan (a-Ch) as an encapsulating ingredient. Interestingly, a-Ch is a cationic polyelectrolyte derived from shellfish exoskeleton which has proven effective in encapsulating lipophilic ingredients, such as LM, leading to multifunctional microcapsules with a potential for personal care products. Notwithstanding, recent research has evidenced the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in blood as well as animal tissues, and seashells indeed. This type of contamination may also pose a severe risk to humans once microplastic-integrated seafood has entered the human food chain. Similarly, microcapsules with a-Ch based shell may occur with microplastics, which are then non-fully biodegradable. Accordingly, there have been increasing regulations on restricting the use of synthetic solid polymers and/or environment polluting microplastic residues in the microcapsule shells. Alongside, there is a growing demand from end-use consumers for genuinely plant-based ingredients to tackle the risk associated with animal sources (e.g., protopathic diseases), and to meet their personal and religious beliefs. As a step forward to comply with the foregoing requirements, noteworthy efforts are being undertaken by researchers to shift towards using more sustainable microplastic-free materials as the shell precursors. In our previous works, we reported the potential of fungally fermented chitosan (fCh) which had proven effective to form shells around model perfume (i.e., hexyl salicylate) and food flavour (i.e., L-Carvone) oils by complex coacervation. When compared to crustacean sourced chitosan, fCh occurs with a relatively lower chitin content, thereby resulting in a larger number of covalently decorated β-glucan branches. Therefore, fCh may benefit from enhanced conformational extensibility, as well as a more pliable structural scaffolding. Moreover, unlike a-Ch, fCh requires no aggressive acid-driven treatment to eliminate calcium carbonate and other mineral impurities.To date, information on LM-entrapping microcapsules with a natural microplastic-free shell and their mechanism of formation is very limited, and there is lack of an in-depth characterisation of their mechanical and adhesive properties, which are crucial for understanding their performance at potential end-use applications, such as in textiles and laundry detergents. Although Souza et al. have reported using Ch microcapsules to immobilise onto cellulose fabrics, their study only focused on the kinetic release of the active ingredient (LM). Similarly, Sánchez-Navarro, Pérez-Limiñana, Arán-Ais and Orgilés-Barceló have described the potential of melamine-formaldehyde and gelatine-carboxymethylcellulose microcapsules retaining LM to incorporate via simple hydrodipping-impregnation procedure into footwear linings and insoles, respectively, which may have a beneficial effect against sweating. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, no extensive study on the mechanical and adhesive properties of vegetable chitosan based LM-entrapping microcapsules has been conducted so far. Therefore, the present research aims towards (i) developing safe microcapsules with a core of LM, fabricated via complex coacervation using gum Arabic (GA) and fCh as the shell precursors, (ii) characterising their mechanical properties using an advanced micromanipulation technique while being cognisant of the potential effect of specific fragrance oils (LM) on the microcapsule mechanical strength in comparison with the state of the art, and (iii) studying their adhesive properties using a bespoke microfluidic device fitted with a smooth polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate and operating at increasingly hydrodynamic shear stress and different environmental pHs to mimic real fabric washing and/or human sweat conditions. ","Gum Arabic (GA) and fungally fermented chitosan (fCh, degree of deacetylation ~80%) were obtained from Nexira Food (Rouen Cedex, France, EU) and Kitozyme S.A. (Herstal, Belgium, EU), respectively. Analytical grade chemicals including D-limonene (LM; specific gravity at 25 °C ≃ 0.84 g·mL−1, CAS number: 5989-54-8), sorbitan triolate (Span85, CAS number: 26266-58-0), triethanolamine (TEA; CAS number: 121-44-8), 50% (w/w) aqueous glutaraldehyde (GLT; CAS number: 111-30-8), sodium hydroxide (NaOH; CAS number: 1310-73-2), ethanol (CAS number 64-17-5), n-nonane (CAS number 111-84-2) and 36% (w/v) fuming hydrochloric acid (HCl; CAS number: 7647-01-0) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, Dorset, UK), stored according to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) guidelines, and utilised without additional purification. All the solutions/suspensions were prepared employing demineralised water (MilliQ water, 18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C).The microcapsules were fabricated via one-step complex coacervation according to Baiocco, Preece and Zhang. Briefly, LM (45 mL) was added to an aqueous admixture (130 mL) containing GA (2% w/w) and fCh (0.3% w/w) at pH 1.95 which had been acidified by HClaq (pH probe in solution; FP20, pH resolution ± 0.01, Mettler Toledo, UK), thus affording two phases. Sorbitan triolate (0.8g; surfactant-to-oil weight ratio 0.02) as the emulsifier was added. Emulsification (1000 rpm; 30 min) was carried out immersing a six-blade Rushton turbine (Ø 34 mm) paired with an overhead stirrer (IKA Eurostar 20, Germany, EU) inside a cylindrical jacketed vessel (liquid Height (H)/Tank diameter (T) = 1; T = H = 0.16 m; Clearance (C)/Impeller Diameter (D) ~3/4) with four baffles (baffle width (b)/Tank diameter (T) ~0.1) and thermostated at 25 ± 0.1 °C (Dyneo™ DD-300F, Julabo Ltd., Stamford, UK) to achieve oil-in-water (o/w) droplets of ~30µm measured by laser diffraction (Malvern Mastersizer 2000, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, England, UK). Complex coacervation between GA and fCh was induced by increasing the pH to 3.4 gradually via addition (160 mL) of TEAaq (30 µL·s−1) with a syringe pump (Ultra 70-3007, Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA, USA) into the emulsified solution to increase the pH gradually to 3.4 (pHCC) under continuous stirring (400 rpm). GLT (0.3 g/g-biopolymer) was added to trigger the crosslinking with amines along the microcapsule shells (reticulation). The suspension of microcapsules was left crosslinking under stirring (300 rpm; ~15 h). The slurry of microcapsules was separated out by vacuum filtration (N938.50KT.18, Laboport Mini Diaphragm Vacuum Pump, KNF Neuberger™, Freiburg, Germany) using membrane filter paper (pore size 0.2 µm; diameter 47 mm, Whatman GmbH, Dassel, Germany, EU), and stored within airtight vials covered with aluminium foil.Laser diffraction technique was employed to quantify and compare the mean size and size distribution between the emulsion droplets and the resulting microcapsules (Mastersizer2000, Malvern Instruments, UK). The emulsion or microcapsule suspension (~3 mL) was added into the continuously stirred (2500 rpm) sample dispersion unit coupled with the instrument. The tests were performed at ambient temperature by a He–Ne laser with a measurement capability range of 50 nm–0.9 mm. The overall refractive index (~1.5), mean Sauter diameter D[3,2] and Span were calculated according to Baiocco, Preece and Zhang.The morphology of the oil droplets and the resulting microcapsules were assessed by bright-field microscopy (Leica DM RBE microscope, Leica Microsystems GmbH, Dassel, Germany, EU). The microscope was equipped with the appropriate magnification lenses (PL Fluotar, 5×/0.12, 506001& 10×/0.30, 506010, 1.0/1.25/1.6×, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and paired with an image capturing software package (Motic Images Advanced version 3.2, Motic China Group Ltd., Xiamen, China) which enabled real-time digitalised image capturing of the photomicrographs (Moticam Pro 205B Digital Camera, Leica Microsystems Imaging Solution Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK).A scanning electron microscope (JEOL 6060, Peabody, MA, USA) was operated at a working distance of 8 mm and accelerated voltage of 15–30 kV to assay the microcapsules for their morphology, surface topography, and structural properties. An aliquot (100 µL) of suspended microcapsules were placed onto an adhesive carbon tab (Leit 9mm disc, Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) attached to the underlying specimen stub, and left until fully dried. Subsequently, the resulting dry microcapsules were coated with platinum via sputter deposition (Polaron Sputter Coater SC7640, QuorumTech, Sussex, UK) under vacuum (~10−3 Pa) and moderate emission current (~25 mA) to achieve a thin metal layer (~8 nm) over 2 min in order to hinder any undesirable charging effect during imaging. Moreover, the SEM micrographs were preliminarily used to estimate the shell thickness of microcapsules which had been cryogenically frozen with liquid nitrogen (−196 °C), and subsequently ground within an agate mortar and pestle to provoke their mechanical fracture.TEM micrographs were acquired to image the cross-sectional areas of thirty microcapsules, as well as to measure their shell thickness (JEM-2100 TEM, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan operating at 200 kV). TEM samples were prepared according to Long, York, Zhang and Preece by embedding microcapsules into hard-grade white acrylic resin inside a centrifugal rotator (4 rpm, 3 min). The resulting cake was left in an oven (60 °C) to set overnight (~15 h). Subsequently, it was sliced into ultrathin sections (~100 nm) by a microtome (UltracutE, Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria) prior to fixation onto the carbon coated copper grids (2 mm2). The sample was carefully loaded into the TEM stage which was then evacuated (~10−5 Pa) to attain the maximal resolution during imaging.Gas chromatography separation method was employed to detect GC-amenable LM from liquid samples and quantify its content via standard calibration. Payload (P%) and Encapsulation efficiency (EE%) were determined according to Baiocco, Preece and Zhang. Air-dried LM-microcapsules (2.5 mg) were suspended in absolute ethanol as the receptor medium (50 mL) within airtight glass vials which were ultrasonicated (VWR Ultrasonicator, USC200TH, Lutterworth, UK) over 60 min to rupture the microcapsule shells hence releasing their oil load. Subsequently, the LM-abundant phase (supernatant) was separated by centrifugation (Sigma 3-18KS, Buckinghamshire, England, UK) and transferred into an automatic parse screw-top amber glass vial (Agilent Technologies, 9-425, CA, US) specially designed for GC. The GC system was a Shimadzu GC-2010, with AOC-20i Injector and AOC-20s Auto-sampler, (Shimadzu UK Ltd., Wolverton, UK) utilising nonane as the internal standard (IS). The column used was a Phenomenex ZB-5 (95% Polydimethyl siloxane/5% Polydiphenyl siloxane) connected to the gas cylinders of He, N2, and compressed air as the carrier gases. Based on the response of LM to the specific detector in the column, the elution time of LM was 7.5 min. The experiments were performed in triplicate.The mechanical properties of microcapsules were investigated using a micromanipulation technique based on the parallel plate compression of individual microcapsules. Two droplets (~75 µL/droplet) of LM-microcapsule suspension were pipetted onto a specially designed highly tempered glass slide with a smooth polished flat surface (2.5 cm2; length 2.5 cm; width 1.0 cm; thickness 0.3 cm) using a micro spoon spatula, which were left air-drying for 4 h. The glass slide was secured onto a metal stage and placed beneath a borosilicate glass probe (initial diameter 0.1 cm, Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Kent, UK) with a flat-end tip of 60 µm (total length 0.8 cm) which had been polished (bending angle 0°) against a microfine lapping sheet (1 µm) using a rotating micropipette grinder (Model EG-40, Narishige, MicroInstruments Ltd., Long Hanborough, UK). The tip was longitudinally superglued (Loctite Cyanoacrylate Superglue, Henkel, Germany, EU) onto the output borosilicate glass tube (outer diameter 1 mm, inner diameter 0.58 mm; Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Kent, UK) of a selected force transducer head (Series 403A, Model 1568, maximum force scale 5.0 mN, Sensitivity 0.459 mN⋅V−1; Aurora Scientific Inc., Ontario, Canada) paired with an electrically powered control box. The force transducer was mounted onto a three-dimensional fine micromanipulator controlled by a servo motor (DC Servocontroller/Driver, CONEX-C, Newport, California, US). The high resolution (±0.2 µm) micromanipulator was operated to move the glass probe upwards/downwards. A descending speed of 2.0 μm·s−1 was selected, which allowed the probe tip to contact and progressively compress each single microcapsule. Microcapsules were digitally observed through a high-speed side-view camera (high magnification (10×–140×); 30 fps; AM4023CT, DinoEye C-Mount Camera, Dino-Lite, Hemel Hempstead, UK). A semi-automatic compression mode was set, which enabled the probe to retreat automatically to its default position once the selected microcapsule had been squashed out. Thirty single randomly selected microcapsules were squashed to generate statistically significant results. The compliance of the force transducer probe was recorded three times prior to compressing the microcapsules, and the corresponding mean value was used to quantify the real displacement of the force transducer probe. The used micromanipulation rig is shown in Figure S1.Zeta potentiometry was employed to quantify the net surface charge (NSC) of water suspended microcapsules (0.25% w/w) with a fCh-GA coacervate shell. A Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK) was operated at ambient temperature. The equipment software relied on Smoluchowski’s mathematical theory which converts electrophoretic mobility measurements of colloids into zeta (ζ) potential or NSC values. Zeta potentiometric titrations were performed utilising 0.1N HCl and 0.1N NaOH to vary the pH of the microcapsule suspension. Specifically, nine specimens at increasingly high pH were titrated to cover the pH range 2.0–10.0, which were stored in airtight glass scintillation vials until zeta potentiometric inspection. Subsequently, the specimens were loaded into disposable polycarbonate-based folded capillary zeta measurement cell equipped with gold-plated electrodes (DTS1070, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK) which had been thoroughly pre-rinsed three times using deionised water (18.2 MΩ·cm−1) prior to performing each measurement.The flow chamber utilised in this study was based on a previous report by Lane, et al.. Its design consisted of two parallel-fitting metal plates (top and bottom plate), which had been manufactured with precipitation-hardened 6061-aluminium alloy (Poynting Physics Workshop, University of Birmingham, West Midlands, UK). A chamber window was built on each plate at the same position. Each window was fitted with pre-cut tempered glass (7.2 ± 0.1 cm × 2.1 ± 0.1 cm; thickness ~0.2 cm), applying cyanoacrylate glass glue (Loctite SuperBonder, Henkel Loctite, CA, USA) to each edge. Silicon O-rings (BS044/046, Polymax, Bordon, UK) were mounted inside to seal the chamber. As detailed by Lane, Jantzen, Carlon, Jamiolkowski, Grenet, Haseltine, Galinat, l. J., Allen, Truskey and Achneck, the flow chamber had length and width of 10.5 cm and 1.7 cm, respectively. The resulting central rectangular area (10.5 cm × 1.7 cm) is etched to a depth of 280 µm (flow height), which provides a unique recessed area in the liquid flow path. A fully flat, transparent, smooth, and amorphous PET film (thickness 0.25 mm; Goodfellow Cambridge Limited, Huntingdon, England, UK) was selected as the model fabric. The PET film was cut out into the required rectangular shape (17 ± 0.4 cm × 3.5 ± 0.2 cm) in order to fit in between the top and bottom plates of the chamber. Such configuration allowed to cover the recessed area securely without affecting neither the flow height nor the accuracy of the resulting shear stress which is flow height dependent (Equation (1)). The plates were secured onto each other using ten stainless steel screws (cordless electric screwdriver, AS6NG, Black&Decker, MD, USA) to assure a liquid-tight assembly. Inlet/Outlet soft silicone tubing (inner Ø ~3 mm) was fitted with one-/three-way stopcocks as well as female/male lock-ring luer connectors (Cole Parmer Instruments, England, UK). A luer lock-tip syringe (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) was employed for sample inoculation, the tip of which was connected to one side of a split-end silicone tubing. The other tubing end was connected to a syringe (60 mL; Becton Dickinson, Spain, EU) loaded with the test solution at the required pH. The syringe was fixed to a syringe pump (Ultra 70-3007, Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA). The full schematic of a flow chamber system is shown in Figure 9, whereas the actual system is displayed in Figure S2.Fluids are fed in and out of the parallel plate flow chamber through the inlet and outlet sections, respectively. Fluids are flowed through the chamber passageways at a given flowrate, thereby generating a shear stress against the walls of the flow chamber. The wall shear stress (τw) represents the force per unit area applied to a solid boundary (wall) against a fluid moving in a longitudinal direction to the wall. For a rectangular shaped flow chamber, τw can be evaluated as follows: where μ [kg·m−1s−1] is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, vv is the flowrate set on the syringe pump [m3·s−1], α = 1/6 is the dimensionless shape factor, δ [m] and h [m] are the inner width and height of the flow chamber, respectively. As reported in literature, the flow is expectedly laminar, which can be confirmed by Reynolds number (laminar flow regime if Re < 2.1 × 103) for non-circular ducts: where ρw [kg·m−3] is the density of the fluid, and Dh is the hydraulic diameter [m] to be evaluated as follows: which is derived as a ratio of cross-sectional area to the wetted perimeter of the duct.Test solutions at different pH (3.2, 4.2, 5.1, 6.1, 7.2) were prepared for each experiment to investigate the effect of pH on the retention performance of perfume microcapsules onto PET films. Each test solution was prepared with deionised water by dropwise addition of aqueous 0.1N HClaq and 0.1N NaOHaq to the required pH.Specimens (i.e., diluted suspension of microcapsules to inoculate into the flow chamber) were obtained from microcapsule slurries. Each slurry (~0.05 g) was weighed and added to the required test solution (20 mL) with the desired pH in order to achieve a 0.25% (w/w) suspension of perfume microcapsules. The resulting specimens were left to rest to equilibrium (30 min), which is similar to the detergent dissolution at the beginning of a real washing cycle. Each specimen was gently shaken prior to its inoculation into the chamber. The size distribution of microcapsules was also measured to prove their size suitable for the height of the passageway (microcapsule-to-height ≤ 0.3) so that no aggregates formed.Loading: The test solution at the required pH was infused into the chamber with a syringe pump (5 mL·min−1; 3 min). The outlet of the flow chamber was slightly tilted upwards to achieve no air bubbles within the system. The chamber was then secured onto the flat microscope stage, and configured downwards according to ρr,LM;Image focusing: The PET film was adjusted into focus onto the lower surface of the PET film in agreement with ρr,LM. The focus included the cross-sectional area of the chamber;Deposition: A specimen aliquot (4 mL) containing suspended microcapsules was inoculated into the flower chamber. Microcapsules were left to rest to equilibrium (30 min), which was monitored via digitalised optical microscopy;Cleaning: The test slurry at the required pH and flowrate (15 μL·min−1) was fed into the system (5 min). This step helped to remove free oil droplets, which may be due to microcapsules rupturing when inoculated;Flushing: Increasing flowrates were selected, leading to a gradual increase of the shear stress. Each flowrate (0.065, 0.125, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, 9.0, 12.0 mL·min−1) was held for 3 min to afford the equilibrium between microcapsules and the PET film. Accordingly, images of microcapsules adhering to the PET film were captured every 3 min from a fixed position via bright-field optical microscopy.One of the most relevant parameters is the relative density (ρr) of microcapsules in aqueous media (ρw). It is essential to know whether the microcapsules naturally float (ρr < ρw) or settle down (ρr > ρw) in order to configure the flow chamber correctly. For microcapsules with a specific gravity greater than water (ρr,oil > ρw), the flow chamber should be positioned standardly, with the top plate upwards and facing the microscope lens. However, the specific gravity of LM-entrapping microcapsules is lower than water (ρr,LM < ρw), thus the flow chamber should be positioned reversed, with the top plate downwards and facing the microscope light. The morphology of microcapsules, their deposition onto PET model films, as well as the topography of the PET model film were assessed by bright-field microscopy. Specifically, the key steps of the process are summarised herein:Images taken during flushing were analysed using an open-source image analysis (IA) software package being ImageJ (1.53c, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Ad-hoc coding was developed to automatically analyse the images (supporting information), which enabled to evaluate the specific area () occupied by microcapsules as compared to their background. Images were first fully desaturated to grey scale, and then converted into black & white to minimise any shading effect. Any hollow hole was automatically filled up for LM-microcapsules to appear as black spots on a white background. The area covered by each microcapsule (Ak) was quantified by detecting the diameter of its corresponding black spot. The total number of spots allowed to determine the cumulative area (Ac) actively covered by all microcapsules on each image, hence: where Ad and Ab are the maximised area occupied by microcapsules at nil shear stress and the baseline area of commercially available model films (where defects might occur), respectively.Three independent replicates of each flow chamber experiment were performed unless indicated otherwise. The difference among the results was expressed as mean value ± standard error (St.E).","Figure 1 displays the digitalised photomicrographs of LM-entrapping microcapsules fabricated by complex coacervation. As can be seen, suspended microcapsules with a yolk-white structure were obtained. Specifically, the microcapsules exhibited individual oil droplets encircled by fCh-GA polymer shells with a slightly elongated or eye-like shape. As previously observed by Leclercq, Harlander and Reineccius from gelatine based microcapsules with a core of LM, this eye-shaped configuration may be ascribable to fast stirring while inducing coacervation, thereby triggering the alignment of the droplets/microcapsules with the flow pattern within the agitated vessel. Moreover, Baiocco, Preece and Zhang have elucidated that some excess shell-forming material could be deformed around the oil droplets by the agitation during the development of the shell, hence generating the eye shape, as reported for microcapsules with a core of hexyl salicylate within a fCh-GA based shell. Interestingly, the suspended microcapsules did not tend to agglomerate. The outline of each individual microcapsule with a relatively smooth surface was clearly visible. Moreover, no free oil droplets were found, which might provide some qualitative information on the encapsulation efficiency of microcapsules. However, this does not mean that the whole volume of oil (LM) used (45 mL) was entirely encapsulated within the coacervate shells. LM tends to evaporate quickly at ambient conditions (psv,LM (20 °C) ~0.2 kPa), and even quicker during homogenisation due to the dissipated heat leading to an increased temperature (~35 °C). In other words, some emulsified oil droplets originally occurring in bulk might have been evaporated prior to being caught up by a coacervate network. Notwithstanding, a proper quantification of the encapsulation efficiency and payload of microcapsules by UV-Vis is required.SEM micrographs of LM-microcapsules are displayed in Figure 2. Individual and clusters of microcapsules with a spherical shape and relatively smooth surface were observed (Figure 2A). The surface topography of microcapsules suggests the presence of surface wrinkles which may be a consequence of the high vacuum during SEM. Moreover, several dark spots were also discernible. Since they appeared blurred, they might be located at a significant depth from the shell surface. Most likely, these dark spots might indicate the presence of subshell reservoirs of LM (Figure 2B). Partly incomplete microcapsules and polymeric debris were also found (Figure 2C). Hemispherical microcapsules with a core-shell structure were evident. SEM micrographs also enabled to estimate the shell thickness of LM-microcapsules preliminarily, which was around 0.5–1.5 µm. However, this estimation was not accurate, thus TEM was performed.Figure 3 displays the size distribution of LM microcapsules in the range of 9–112 μm (SPAN = 1.21), with a mean Sauter (surfaceweighted D[3,2]) diameter of 38 ± 2 μm. As shown, a single-peak distribution suggested that clusters of microcapsules were unlikely in suspension. Moreover, statistical analysis showed that a log-normal distribution can be fitted to the size distribution data with 95% confidence. These results also confirmed that the size of microcapsule was suitable for their inoculation into the flow chamber (inner height of the flow chamber 280 µm) as described in Section 3.3.8, without any risk for clogging of the passageways of the microfluidic device.LM-microcapsules were assayed for EE and payload via GC. The EE and payload were 44 ± 3% and 29 ± 2%, respectively. These results appeared in good agreement with the values which had been obtained from microcapsules with a core of hexyl salicylate (HS), regardless of the different analytical technique used (i.e., UV-Vis for HS-microcapsules). Interestingly, the standard errors associated with both EE and payload from LM-microcapsules were approximately three-fold lower than those of HS microcapsules (EE%,HS = 47 ± 11% and P%,HS = 40 ± 7%). This finding is probably ascribable to the different level of accuracy and sensitivity between these two analytical techniques. As reported in literature, GC is often preferred for the identification, quantification, and separation of specific terpenic analytes, such as limonene. Although highly accurate, GC is time consuming and rather expensive, whereas UV-Vis is more rapid and versatile. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the static leakage (in air) of terpenic compounds from fCh-GA coacervate shells was negligible after 50 days. Similarly, another model oil (i.e., hexyl salicylate) encapsulated within a fCh-GA shell showed no significant oil leakage in water after one month. Having said that, limonene laden microcapsules may be expected to perform similarly, which can be appealing for many fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) requiring a prolonged retention of the active. The LM leakage rate under different environmental conditions remains to be measured directly, which is future work.Figure 4A displays the rupture force of LM-microcapsules as a function of diameter. Interestingly, the rupture force increased with diameter, which is consistent with the trend of microcapsules with a similar nature (HS microcapsules) and/or different chemistry (i.e., melamine-formaldehyde). Similarly, the nominal rupture stress (Figure 4B) decreased with diameter, whereas the displacement at rupture increased with diameter (Figure 4C). Although the trends were found to be in good agreement with those from the other microcapsules, their average values differed significantly. The average rupture force of LM-microcapsules (0.93 ± 0.10 mN) was approximately half of that of HS-microcapsules (2.0 ± 0.1 mN). Interestingly, this result was approximately one third of the maximum value of commercially relevant microcapsules (2.66 ± 0.31 mN) with similar size (15–25 µm) and a melamine-formaldehyde based shell with a 10:1 (w/w) admixture of HB40-kerosene as the core (HB40-microcapsules). When dealing with the number-based diameter of LM-microcapsules obtained from micromanipulation, its value (dLM = 24.4 ± 1.2 µm) appeared to be similar to that of HS-microcapsules (dHS = 27.5 ± 1.5 µm). Thus, the mechanical properties of the two types of microcapsules may be compared directly. Based on the results, LM-microcapsules seem to be naturally weaker and easier to rupture than HS microcapsules. However, the rupture force as such is not sufficient to fully compare the mechanical strength between two types of microcapsules. Their deformation at rupture and nominal rupture stress were thus examined. For two kinds of microcapsules, if one ruptures at a significantly smaller displacement, this is related to a higher structural brittleness of the microcapsule; in contrast, if the other ruptures at a larger displacement, this is associated with a greater structural flexibility and stretchability of the microcapsule. The average displacement at rupture of LM-microcapsules was 3.4 ± 0.4 µm, which is approximately half of that of HS-microcapsules (6.3 ± 3.1 µm). This seems to confirm that LM-microcapsules were ruptured at a smaller deformation on average than HS-microcapsules. Therefore, LM-microcapsules might be structurally more brittle. The average nominal rupture stress was 2.1 ± 0.2 MPa for LM-microcapsules, whereas that of HS-microcapsules were higher (3.6 ± 0.3 MPa). For completion, the average rupture tension, which is normally independent of size, of both types of microcapsules should be verified, which is defined as the rupture force to mean diameter ratio of microcapsules. Accordingly, the rupture tension of LM-microcapsules was determined to be 37.7 ± 3.0 N/m, which is approximately half of that of HS microcapsules (71.6 ± 3.9 N/m), as expected. The relevant mechanical parameters of LM-microcapsules in comparison with those from other types of microcapsules are listed in Table 1.Overall, these values highlighted that LM-microcapsules were structurally weaker than HS-entrapping microcapsules. Generally, if two microcapsules have similar size, displacement at rupture, and rupture force and hence rupture tension, they then possess comparable mechanical strength. Although the same chemistry and process (i.e., complex coacervation) were applied to fabricate the shell of both LM- and HS-microcapsules, significantly different mechanical properties were found. Therefore, additional considerations should be given. Although LM is deemed to be a relatively stable terpene in microencapsulation, the effect of the Span-stabilised emulsion droplets, their chemistry, and the resulting surface interfacial tension on fCh-GA coacervates is still unknown. When two immiscible liquid phases (e.g., core oil phase (LM) and polymer-abundant aqueous phase (fCh/GA)) are mixed in an agitated vessel, the combined effects of turbulence (i.e., flow pattern, agitation conditions, impeller and vessel geometry) and their interfacial energy is conducive to the formation of emulsified droplets. However, the resulting emulsions are thermodynamically unstable which may revert back as separate phases promptly. As for our work, surface active agents (SAAs; surfactants) have been broadly utilised to stabilise the disperse phase droplets. SAAs are typically made of amphipathic segments (i.e., hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups) which can adsorb onto the biphasic interface sterically and/or ionically based on their nature. Accordingly, the effective adsorption of SAAs at the droplet interface leads to reducing its interfacial tension and the resulting energy level alignment, thereby stabilising the emulsions. It is widely accepted that the minimisation of surface energy is a necessary but not sufficient criterium towards microencapsulation. Under the appropriate processing conditions (pH, temperature, relative humidity, mechanical agitation, core to shell weight ratio, etc), SAA-assisted energetically lowest lying emulsion systems may offer the most energetically favourable conformations for a coating to form around a droplet. To this end, Tasker et al. have reported a possible interrelationship between the interfacial energy of two-phase emulsions stabilised with a cationic class of SAAs (Cetrimonium bromide (Cx-TAB)) and the morphology of the resulting microcapsules. It is well known that the microcapsule morphology is administered by the interfacial energy balance (IEB) between the phases in the microcapsule and depends upon the wetting conditions between the occurring phases in the system. Specifically, the authors employed poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) dispersed in an organochlorine solvent (methylene chloride (MTC)) as the encapsulant polymer and key commercial fragrance oils (i.e., HS and cyclamen aldehyde) as the core ingredient. Based on the mathematical evaluation of the spreading coefficients from the interfacial tensions between the phases present in the final capsule slurry, the microcapsule morphology was tentatively predicted. For encapsulating both fragrance oils, a core-shell structure was predicted and indeed achieved experimentally. This suggested that the polymer-rich phase was sufficient to wet the core phase selectively in MTC. In other words, an energetically favourable configuration between the shell and the core materials along with the appropriate wetting conditions were met, which allowed core-shell microcapsules to form via evaporation of MTC. The evaporation of MTC progressively reduced the polymer solubility within the core phase, thereby triggering the precipitation of PMMA matter onto the core oil droplets. Interestingly, there appeared that microcapsules with similar structures (core-shell morphology) and surface roughness were attained although different encapsulant oils were used. However, the work provided no information on whether such microcapsules (i.e., same shell chemistry and different oil cores) may perform similarly or rather differently with regard to their mechanical properties. In our work, sorbitan triolate (Span85®) was used as the SAA to stabilise LM microdroplets prior to inducing encapsulation by complex coacervation, as also reported in the literature. As previously discussed, our findings have elucidated that LM-microcapsules were found to be mechanically weaker than the HS-microcapsules, although the same shell chemistry and SAA were employed, as well as the processing conditions. In other words, it seemed that physicochemical interplays between the coacervate shells and oils may not be negligible, which were more evident in the case of LM as the core oil. Sharkawy et al. utilised animal sourced chitosan and gum Arabic to fabricate microcapsules with a core of limonene oil by coacervation. Span85 was used as a SAA which led to mostly mononuclear microcapsules, which is in very good agreement with our findings (Figure 1). In addition, the authors encapsulated vanillin essential oil following the same methodology. Both oils led to core-shell microcapsules with similar surface characteristics. In contrast, the use of polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) as the SAA, under the same processing conditions, resulted in microcapsules with a polynuclear morphology in both cases. Based on their results, the type of the emulsifier (Span85/PGPR) seemed to have a significant influence on the microcapsule morphology, and also on their size, encapsulation efficiency, and barrier properties (i.e., release profile of the core oil through the shell into n-hexane as a receptor medium). However, no insight into the mechanical properties of microcapsules was given. Interestingly, the studies presented by Tasker et al. and Sharkawy et al. seemed to suggest that the morphological, surface, and barrier properties might be directly ruled by the IEB between the phases occurring in the microcapsules. Regardless of the encapsulation methodology, core-shell systems are controlled by the relative surface energy of each phase involved towards a total interfacial energy minimisation status. In contrast, if the internal core-shell surface energy is relatively large, then a partial/complete detachment between the phases may be favoured. This may tentatively help explain why LM-microcapsules were found to be mechanically weaker than the HS-microcapsules.This phenomenon may be associated with the interfacial interaction and energy level alignment of the core oil (LM) towards the innermost lining of the fChGA coacervate network. The interfacial energy can vary significantly depending on the specific interaction between a certain solid (e.g., fChGA coacervate network) and a given medium (inner oil phase). The inner core-shell (LM-fChGA) surface energy may be large enough to possibly impair the intermolecular bonds forming the shell network, thereby affecting the resulting thickness and stability of the shell, in turn hindering the overall robustness of the microcapsule. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the LM-fChGA energy level may be significantly higher than that of HS-fChGA due to the nature of terpenic molecules (LM), hence leading to a partial weakening of the solid phase (fChGA) at its intermolecular level. Although feasible, the encapsulation of LM seemed less favourable with regard to the microcapsule mechanical properties when compared to that of HS which is an ester oil. Likely, LM is less stable physico-chemically which may have led to the mechanically depleted microcapsule shells.Despite the key role of the interfacial energy towards determining core-shell interaction and stability, as well as the thickness and robustness of the shell, surprisingly, no experimental attempt linking the core-shell IEB to the mechanical properties of microcapsules has arisen so far. It is therefore imperative to conduct further studies to determine the dependency of the microcapsule mechanical properties on the core-shell IEB. This may help towards a new understanding in this field in order to meet the current manufacturing challenges as well as developing novel and highly functional products with enhanced quality at end-use applications. Figure 5A displays the cross-section of a LM-microcapsule. There appeared to be a relatively homogeneous shell at point α and β, and the thickness was 1.25 ± 0.02 µm and 1.33 ± 0.04 µm, respectively. In contrast, point C showed an unclear region, which might result from random slicing at planes other than the equator during sample preparation (artifact). Thirty cross-sections of LM-microcapsules were selected and imaged, which had proven statistically representative. Accordingly, the apparent mean shell thickness (h) of LM-microcapsules was determined to be 0.87 ± 0.09 µm which was not statistically different from that of HS-microcapsules (0.78 ± 0.06 µm), as reported in our previous work. The different key mechanical properties between HS- and LM-microcapsules (Table 1) might result from their different structural configuration, and compactness of the shell materials. Furthermore, a strong relationship (R2 = 0.94) between the shell thickness and the diameter of microcapsules arose (Figure 5B). Interestingly, it was found that h increased linearly with the diameter, suggesting that the larger the oil droplet, the thicker the protective shell. Fundamental characterisation of the adhesive properties of LM microcapsules onto fabric substrates is vital to understand their potential applications in fabric care via maximising their retention onto target fabrics. A smooth and flat PET film as a model substrate may help to avoid any typical steric effect and physical interference due to crimp and coarse woven fabrics. The retention performance (RP) of LM microcapsules onto PET films as a function of the hydrodynamic shear stress (τ) and the Reynolds number (Re) is shown in Figure 6. The corresponding laminar regime within the chamber (0 < Re ≤ 30 or 0 < τ ≤ 0.9 Pa) is relevant to real washing hydrodynamics, as reported elsewhere. At a low acidic pH 3.2, it was found that the RP of LM-microcapsules was ~70% and ~60% at <0.1 Pa (Re < 5) and 0.9 Pa (Re ≃ 30), respectively. In addition, at τ > 0.1 Pa the RP of LM-microcapsules was not significantly impaired, and only a marginal reduction at increasingly high Reynolds numbers (5 < Re < 30) was observed. This finding suggests that an equilibrium between the two contact surfaces (i.e., microcapsules and PET films) may have been reached. As for pH 3.2, LM microcapsules also exhibited a similar behaviour to that at pH 4.1 where a high RP of ~70% at 50 mPa was recorded. However, unlike pH 3.2, a mild (~5%) reduction in their RP (~55%) at pH 4.1 was observed. Interestingly, at weakly acidic (pH 5.1–6.2) and near neutral (pH 7.2) environments under τ ≥ 0.45 Pa (Re ≥ 15), the corresponding curve showed a dramatic drop of the RP of microcapsules to 20–30% and <15%, respectively. As can be seen, these values were found to be much lower than those achieved at pH 3.2 and 4.1, where around 60% and 55% of microcapsules had been retained successfully under moderate (0.45 Pa) and high hydrodynamic shear stress (0.9 Pa). At pH 5.1, the RP of LM microcapsules exposed to 0.9 Pa (Re ≃ 30) was determined to be ~25%, whereas only <10% of microcapsules had been retained at pH 6.2 and pH 7.2. Overall, the highest RP of LM microcapsules onto PET films was identified at pH 3.2. This finding seems to suggest that a direct effect of the environmental pH on the RP of the microcapsules onto the PET films is significant, regardless of the shear stress applied. Figure 7 displays an example of real-time removal of microcapsules adhering to a fully flat PET film at pH 3.2 under increasingly high shear stress (0–0.9 Pa).Since LM microcapsules were fabricated via pH-driven CC, their shell may be plausibly pH sensitive. Consequently, the environmental pH may affect the surface charge of microcapsules and the mutual hydrophobic interaction between the shells and PET substrates, hence their adhesive properties. Figure 8 shows the net surface charge (NSC) response of microcapsules with a fCh-GA shell at different pH. As can be seen, a negative trend between the microcapsule NSC and the environmental pH was attained. It was found that the NSC decreased significantly from 15.7 ± 0.4 mV at pH 2 to 3.6 ± 0.1 mV at pH 3 likely due to the increase in OH− in the system. As the pH is further increased to pH 3.4, the isoelectric point (pHiep) of the microcapsules was approached with a slightly negative NSC of −0.6 ± 0.1 mV. This result was in line with our previous work elucidating that the optimal pH at which complex coacervation between fCh and GA was driven (pHCC 3.4) effectively led to coacervate shells with almost nil net surface charge. As also documented by Butstraen and Salaün, animal chitosan-gum Arabic coacervate shells can be obtained successfully with the strongest electrostatically binding force at pH 3.4–3.6. However, the slightly negative NSC detected at pH 3.4 may be ascribable to the residual ionic strength and/or local ionic imbalances occurring across the electric double layer (Stern and slipping planes) surrounding the microcapsule, which may result in a relative excess of hydroxide ions. As expected, the switchover of the microcapsule surface charge occurred approximately at pHCC. As the pH is progressively increased above pHiep, more and more negative NSC values were detected. At moderately acidic pH (pH 4–6), the NSC was in the range from −6.4 ± 0.4 mV to −11.3 ± 1.6 mV, whereas at neutral pH, the corresponding NSC was −14.7 ± 1.4 mV. When mirroring the NSC values of LM-microcapsules (Figure 8) with their corresponding RP (Figure 6) at the same pH, it can be noticed that the adhesive properties of the microcapsules onto PET films were maximised around pHCC ∼ pHiep. At increasingly high environmental pH values (4.1 < pH ≤ 7.2) their RP was significantly depleted. As reported in literature, untreated PET and polyester fibres are negatively charged at pH 3–9 with a surface charge approximately ranging from −2 mV to −35 mV. Therefore, an increasingly negative surface charge of PET with the pH certainly contributed to promoting the repulsive interaction between the microcapsule shell and the PET film since both were highly negatively charged at pH > 4.1. Moreover, the effective attachment of LM microcapsules onto the PET may also be related to multiple adhesion mechanisms, such as hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals forces. When dealing with chitosan, Liu, et al. have also suggested that both amines and carboxyl groups along the backbone of fCh and GA, respectively, were not only responsible for the coacervated shells but also contributed to generating significant hydrogen bonding, which may promote the adhesive properties of the resulting microcapsules, especially at low acidic pH. However, it is not clear how the pH affects possible hydrophobic interaction and Van der Waals forces between the microcapsules and PET film, which remains to be investigated in future. ",,"The fabrication of LM-laden microcapsules within a vegetable microplastic-free fCh-GA shell via pH-driven complex coacervation was investigated. Spherical as well as slightly elongated microcapsules were attained with a mean Sauter diameter of diameter of 38 ± 2 µm. The highest EE of the microcapsules was ~45%, which is similar to those in literature for similar microcapsules via CC from animal-derived Ch and other biopolymers. The mechanical properties were quantified by a micromanipulation technique. The micromanipulation results highlighted that the rupture force of the microcapsules increased with the diameter, whereas the nominal rupture stress decreased with the size on average, which is similar to other microcapsules reported in literature. However, the formed microcapsules with a core of LM were found to be mechanically weaker than those of vegetable chitosan microcapsules with a core of HS. The mean rupture tension of LM-laden microcapsules was 37.7 ± 3.0 N/m, which was significantly lower than that of HS-microcapsules (71.6 ± 3.9 N/m). Similarly, the comparison between their average nominal rupture stress suggested that LM-laden microcapsules (2.1 ± 0.2 MPa) were also lower than the HS-laden microcapsules (3.6 ± 0.3 MPa). Besides, the microcapsules exhibited an average displacement at rupture of 3.4 ± 0.4 µm, which is approximately half of that of HS-microcapsules (6.3 ± 3.1 µm). In addition, TEM analysis suggested that the shell thickness of LM-laden microcapsules increases linearly with their diameter with an average value of 0.87 ± 0.09 µm, which appeared to be statistically equal to that of HS-microcapsules (0.78 ± 0.06 µm). In other words, LM-laden microcapsules averagely ruptured at a smaller force and strain than HS-microcapsules suggesting the occurrence of less robust shells. This phenomenon may be due to the LM-fChGA interfacial energy level being relatively higher than that of HS-fChGA, possibly leading to microcapsule shells with a less energetically favourable configuration owing to the intermolecular weakening of the solid fChGA particles forming the shell. Under wet conditions, the adhesive properties of LM-laden microcapsules were investigated by a microfluidic device fitted with PET films. The highest retention performance (~60–70%) of LM microcapsules onto PET films was identified at pH 3.2 which is very similar to pHCC 3.4 and the isoelectric point (pHiep) of the microcapsules. It seemed that such pH may promote a strong mutual electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the PET film and the coacervate shells for the investigated hydrodynamic shear stress (0–0.9 Pa). Moreover, it was found that net surface charge of LM-laden microcapsules became more and more negative as the pH was increased, which contributed towards promoting the repulsive interaction between the microcapsule and the PET films already occurring with a negative charge, resulting in a reduced microcapsule retention. Overall, the results herein presented suggest that microcapsules with a core of limonene may offer an opportunity towards more environmentally and user-friendly applications in many FMCG formulations (e.g., fabric care), as well as tackling the ongoing global issues concerning animal-sourced, and microplastic-based products."
31,TA038373,10.1007/s00253-007-0953-5,Functional analysis of genes involved in the biosynthesis of isoprene in Bacillussubtilis.,"In comparison to other bacteria Bacillus subtilis emits the volatile compoundisoprene in high concentrations. Isoprene is the smallest representative of thenatural product group of terpenoids. A search in the genome of B. subtilisresulted in a set of genes with yet unknown function, but putatively involved inthe methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway to isoprene. Further identificationof these genes would give the possibility to engineer B. subtilis as a host cellfor the production of terpenoids like the valuable plant-produced drugsartemisinin and paclitaxel. Conditional knock-out strains of putative genes wereanalyzed for the amount of isoprene emitted. Differences in isoprene emissionwere used to identify the function of the enzymes and of the correspondingselected genes in the MEP pathway. We give proof on a biochemical level thatseveral of these selected genes from this species are involved in isoprenebiosynthesis. This opens the possibilities to investigate the physiologicalfunction of isoprene emission and to increase the endogenous flux to theterpenoid precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, forthe heterologous production of more complex terpenoids in B. subtilis.","Julsing, Mattijs K, Rijpkema, Michael, Woerdenbag, Herman J, Quax, Wim J, Kayser, Oliver",2007,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2,False,False,True,"Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene; I) or actually isopentenyl diphosphate (IDP; II) is the general precursor of all terpenoids, that represent a very diverse class of natural products. Two evolutionary distinct routes occur in nature for the biosynthesis of IDP. The spread of the two pathways is well investigated for organisms with a sequenced genome (Lange et al.; Boucher and Doolittle; Rohdich et al.). In eukaryotes and archaea IDP and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP; III) are formed via the mevalonate pathway (reviewed by Kuzuyama). This pathway is well studied and for many organisms the enzymes are characterized and the encoding genes identified. More recently, another pathway to IDP was discovered in some eubacteria and in plastids of higher plants, that proceeds via the intermediate methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) (Rohmer et al.; Rohmer).Most Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, use the MEP pathway and for E. coli this is now well documented. For Gram-positive bacteria the situation is less clear. Gram-positive cocci have been reported to only possess genes for the mevalonate pathway (Wilding et al.). In Streptomyces aeriouvifer both pathways are found (Seto et al.). In Bacillus subtilis, being regarded as the prototype for Gram-positives, only homologues of the genes for the MEP pathway are present (Wagner et al.).For E. coli the complete MEP pathway has been elucidated and the genes involved have been identified and the corresponding enzymes described (reviewed by Eisenreich et al.). The pathway exists of seven subsequent enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). The first reaction of the MEP pathway is catalyzed by a transketolase (DXS) and concerns the condensation of pyruvate (IV) and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (V) to 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (VI) (Sprenger et al.; Lois et al.). 1-deoxy-d-xylulose is a branching intermediate in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, thiamine (vitamin B1) (White; David et al.), and pyridoxol (vitamin B6), respectively (Hill et al.). The second step is catalyzed by the IspC protein, initiating a rearrangement in the carbon skeleton followed by a reduction in the keto function of (VI), and finally delivering 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (Takahashi et al.). Five other subsequently acting enzymes are needed for the synthesis of IDP, including a phosphocytidyl transferase (IspD), a kinase (IspE), a cyclophosphate synthase (IspF), and two reductases (IspG, IspH) (Fig. 1).  Bacteria use the precursors IDP and DMADP for the synthesis of several compounds including the side chains of ubiquinone or menaquinone. Next to that, several bacterial species use these precursors to synthesize isoprene, that is emitted to their environment (Kuzma et al.). B. subtilis emits isoprene in high levels compared to other bacterial species as has been described for B. subtilis 6051, B. subtilis 23059, and B. subtilis 23856 (Kuzma et al.). Using a bioreactor system, the emission of isoprene by B. subtilis 6051 was found to occur in three phases during the growth curve (Wagner et al.). The phases correspond with respectively, glucose metabolism and secretion of acetoin, catabolism of acetoin, and the early stage of sporulation. The general laboratory strain B. subtilis 168 showed another pattern of isoprene emission, lacking phases 2 and 3 (Fall and Copley). The function of the emitted isoprene has been postulated as being a signal molecule in the natural environment of the microorganism. Another possible explanation for the emitted isoprene is the efflux as an overflow metabolite in the bacterial pathway to isoprenoid structures (Fall and Copley). The uptake of isoprene by microorganisms present in soil samples has been described as a sink of atmospheric isoprene (Cleveland and Yavitt). However, there is no full evidence supporting one of the hypotheses mentioned. Isoprene originates from DMADP. The conversion of DMADP in isoprene is known to be an enzymatic process in the poplar tree from which a gene has been isolated and characterized (Miller et al.; Schnitzler et al.). Attempts to prove the enzymatic conversion to isoprene in B. subtilis suggested the involvement of an enzymatic step. Enzymatic activity has been partially purified, but the enzyme turned out to be very labile (Sivy et al.). Until now the encoding gene could not be identified. A search for a homologue protein of the isoprene synthase from poplar tree in the genome of the B. subtilis did not yield a candidate. Based on homology with known genes, mostly from E. coli, candidate genes for the other enzymatic steps in the MEP pathway in B. subtilis have been suggested. Identification of the genes involved in this pathway should shed some light on the function of isoprene synthesis in Bacillus physiology. Due to the essentiality of the products downstream of the isoprenoid biosynthesis, like menaquinone, it is not remarkable that the candidate genes, except for the isomerase, have been shown to be essential genes for the survival of the bacterial cell (Kobayashi et al.). In the construction of the BFAN collection these knock-out strains were not viable and therefore conditional mutants have been made using a pMUTIN3-vector. The expression in these strains can be regulated by the isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible Pspac promoter (Yansura and Henner; Vagner et al.). Using this mutant system, expression levels can be regulated to a minimum for survival by decreasing the amounts of IPTG. In that way, the function of the genes can be investigated. Identification of the involvement of certain genes in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, may create possibilities to redirect the metabolic flux toward IDP. The possibilities of pathway engineering have shown their strength already in other microorganisms, like E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The metabolic flux was dependent mainly on the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), the isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (Idi), and the prenyltransferase delivering farnesyl diphosphate (IspA) (Harker and Bramley; Kim and Keasling; Kajiwara et al.; Martin et al.). By up-regulation of the MEP pathway, B. subtilis can be developed as an interesting host organism for the production of complex terpenoid compounds, such as the valuable drugs artemisinin and paclitaxel. In the present study we describe the functional analysis of genes in B. subtilis putatively encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the terpenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate. We used quantitative isoprene emission of different well controllable knock-out Bacillus strains in their environment to determine the function of the tested genes.","Bacterial strains used are listed in Table 1. B. subtilis strains 6051, 23059 and 23856 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, USA). B. subtilis mutant strains were obtained through a chromosomal integration of pMUTIN3 derived plasmids (Vagner et al.). Experiments were performed using Luria-Bertani (LB)-medium containing 1% bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl (all purchased from Duchefa, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands). If required, medium was supplemented with erythromycin (2 μg/ml; Duchefa, the Netherlands) or the specified concentration of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Duchefa, the Netherlands). For growing on plates the medium was solidified with 1.5% agar.  A single colony of the different B. subtilis strains was transferred from a plate to 10 ml Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (if required supplemented with 2 μg/ml erythromycin and 100 μM IPTG) and grown over night (37°C; 300 rpm). Before the inoculation (1:100) of fresh LB medium containing different specified concentrations of IPTG, cells were gently washed three times with fresh LB-medium without IPTG by resuspending and centrifugating.Isoprene accumulation was measured on-line by sampling every 15 min, during a period of nine hours, 15 ml of the air above 50 ml bacterial culture, growing (37°C; 300 rpm) in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer air tight flask (CBN, the Netherlands), and transferring into a gas-chromatography system suitable for the sensitive detection of isoprene (Syntech Spectras GC955 series 601, Synspec BV, the Netherlands) (Loreto and Delfine). The air was pumped through a Tenax GA trap, desorbed at 180°C and transferred to an AT 5 column under a flow of 2.5 ml/min nitrogen (3.7 bars; quality 5). The temperature program used was 3 min at 50°C followed by an increase in temperature to 70°C at 5 min; kept at this temperature until 12 min and than lowered to 50°C again. The isoprene present was detected by photo ionization at 10.6 eV. The gas chromatograph was calibrated using the dynamic gas dilution principle with several concentrations of gaseous isoprene using liquid isoprene (Sigma, USA) diluted in methanol and evaporated with a gas dilutor (MK5, MCZ Umwelttechnik, Germany). During the isoprene detection the growth of the bacterial culture was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD600 nm) every hour.","The emission of isoprene from B. subtilis wild type strains 168, 6051, 23059, and 23856 was investigated. For all four strains isoprene accumulated in the logarithmic phase of growth, leading to a high increase in isoprene in the flask. The absolute maximum of wild type strains varied between 400 and 700 μg/m3. Starting from the late logarithmic phase to the beginning of the stationary phase the amount of isoprene in the flask decreased slowly.Figure 2 shows the accumulation of isoprene during the growth of the wild type strains 168 and 6051. B. subtilis 6051 reached higher levels of isoprene, but this is probably not caused by a higher production rate rather than the amount of cells present, as reflected by the optical density of these strains. Corrected for the amount of cells, determined as the optical density at 600 nm, B. subtilis 168 accumulated at maximum 148 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm compared to 166 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm for B. subtilis 6051. The other two wild type strains tested, 23059 and 23856, showed a similar accumulation of isoprene as the strains described before. Corrected for the amount of cells, 23059 produced 192 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm and 23856 produced 112 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm isoprene at maximum accumulation (Table 2).   To find the optimal conditions in which expression of the genes can be limited without killing the cells, each conditional mutant strain was subjected to IPTG depletion by growing the strains on agar plates containing different concentrations of IPTG varying from 0 to 1 mM. Decreasing the concentration of IPTG caused growth inhibition after overnight incubation resulting in smaller and finally no colonies (on plates without IPTG) at 37°C. Table 3 shows the minimal concentration of IPTG at which still some growth was observed for the different conditional mutant strains. This concentration of IPTG was used in our experiments and defined as the condition causing limited induction. Most mutant strains indeed showed growth inhibition at lower concentration of IPTG. The mutant strain168IyqfY, the mutant for the putative gene encoding a homologue of the IspG protein (step 6) did not show any dependency on IPTG on plates (varying IPTG concentrations from 0 to 1 mM). Plates without IPTG incubated overnight resulted in the growth of normal colonies and the liquid cultures obtained growth curves comparable with wild type B. subtilis 168, independent of the concentration of IPTG. For some of the other mutant strains there was some growth of the bacterial cultures without IPTG as well, although severely impaired.  For all conditional knock out strains isoprene emission was measured at the concentration of IPTG with limited expression in comparison to 1 mM (full induction) and no IPTG (full repression).Figure 3 represents the data for strain 168IyqiE, the conditional mutant strain for the first step in the biosynthetic pathway. Full induction of the dxs gene resulted in a normal growth curve of the bacterial culture and in an isoprene accumulation profile comparable to the profile of the wild type stain B. subtilis 168. Depletion of IPTG inhibited cell growth. The maximal concentration of isoprene accumulated in the flask and corrected for the amount of cells was 15 fold lower for the culture supplemented with 10 μM IPTG (8 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm) than for the culture with 1 mM IPTG (119 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm).  Table 3 shows the maximum concentration of isoprene accumulated in the flask calculated on the amount of cells present at that time point for all tested mutant strains. Mutant strains for putative genes yluB, yacM, yabH, yacN, and yqfP encoding enzymes for respectively, steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 showed significant differences in isoprene emission, varying from a 5–28 fold decrease at limited expression levels in comparison to full induction.The knock-out strain of ypgA, putatively encoding an isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (step 8), is the only knock-out of a nonessential gene. The mutant strain showed a normal growth curve and did not show a significant difference in the emission of isoprene in comparison to the wild type strain B. subtilis 168.We also tested the function of yqiD, encoding a homologue for farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDP; 7), synthase IspA (step 9) of E. coli. Depletion of IPTG to 10 μM did not result in a significant change in the isoprene emission by the mutant strain, while it did show to be dependent on IPTG for growth.","To identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of the highly volatile compound isoprene, an efficient online detection system for this terpenoid (precursor) in the air above bacterial cultures was developed. Since the B. subtilis strains 6051, 23059, and 23856 were known to emit isoprene (Kuzma et al.), we used these strains to set up the detection system for B. subtilis 168 for which the genome has been sequenced (Kunst et al.) and functional knock outs have been made. All four strains emitted isoprene in our experiment. The differences in the amounts of isoprene emitted corresponded with the levels as described before, where B. subtilis 6051 and B. subtilis 23059 emitted higher amounts than B. subtilis 23856 (Kuzma et al.). Since B. subtilis 168 showed emission of isoprene, the use of the experimental set up to investigate the isoprene synthesis by the mutant strains was justified. From the profile of isoprene emission with a maximum at the transition of the growth curve from the logarithmic phase to the stationary phase, it was concluded that from this time point on maximum isoprene concentrations had been reached and that amounts sampled from the culture every 15 min exceeded the production of new isoprene. We could not detect isoprene production in three phases using standard incubation in a shaking flask as has been described for B. subtilis 6051 grown in a bioreactor.The conditional knock out strain of the yqiE encoding DXS, the transketolase responsible for the first step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, appeared to be highly dependent on IPTG. The dramatic decrease in isoprene production at low concentration of IPTG supported the role of this gene in the biosynthetic pathway of isoprene. yqiE has been identified as dxs encoding 1-d-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate in B. subtilis before (Harker and Bramley; Hecht et al.). However, the confirming results for this mutant strain proved that the experimental set up of our work was valid to investigate the function of the other putative genes. Apparently, the isoprene emission is severely decreased when genes in the pathway are expressed at lower level than in the wild type strain.Growth at the end of the incubation after several hours, as shown for many of the liquid cultures under IPTG depletion or even without suppletion of IPTG, may be explained by the occurrence of reversions in the mutant strain (Zanen et al.). Another explanation could be the presence of a not fully repressed promoter in the complementation strain. It has been reported that in the used vector pMUTIN3 the Pspac promoter can give some low expression even in the absence of IPTG (Vagner et al.; Petit et al.). For genes showing low levels of expression in the wild type strain it is easy to get a pseudo wild type level of expression in the mutant strain. This may be in particular the case for highly efficient enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway.For the putative genes yluB, yacM, yabH, yacN, and yqfP, encoding homologues of the enzymatic steps 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, the isoprene accumulation of the conditional knock outs by depletion of IPTG clearly proved the involvement of these genes in the biosynthetic pathway isoprene. B. subtilis 168IyqfY (step 6) did not depend on IPTG and therefore nothing can be concluded from the data obtained with this mutant strain other than that this enzyme may be highly efficient leading to complementation already obtained at the low expression levels caused by leaking activity of the Pspac promoter (Zanen et al.).The nonessential gene ypgA encodes a homologue protein for an isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (Idi) (step 8). The B. subtilis gene ypgA encodes for a so-called isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase type II protein (Takagi et al.), while the genome of E. coli harbours a gene for a different Idi type I enzyme (Hahn et al.). Interestingly, all archaea contain the Idi type II and all eukaryotes contain Idi type I. In genomes of eubacteria both are found, but there are also genomes without any of the described genes (Boucher and Doolittle). In contrast to all other genes investigated in this study, the gene ypgA encoding for the IdiII was shown to be a nonessential gene in B. subtilis (Takagi et al.). We also observed that the knock-out mutant of the bacterial strain is viable and produces isoprene. The idiI gene of E. coli has also been shown to be nonessential. Deletion mutants of this gene were viable on minimal medium (Hahn et al.). Our findings, that the isoprene emission is not influenced by the knock out of the ypgA gene, can be explained by the enzymatic mechanism of the IspH protein, step 7, before the isomerase. IDP and DMADP can be synthesized independently by the catalytic action of IspH. A hypothetical mechanism for this reaction has been described (Eisenreich et al.). This supports the nonessential character of the gene. The presence of isoprene proves that the isomer DMADP is still synthesized in the mutant and that the cells do not depend on the isomerase for the production of DMADP from IDP only. The isomerase functions in the balance of IDP and DMADP as a salvage protein (Eisenreich et al.).The first enzymatic biosynthetic step downstream the formation of the precursors IDP and DMADP is catalyzed by IspA, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (step 9). Therefore the putative gene is not involved in the biosynthesis of isoprene itself. The observation that isoprene is still emitted while the expression of the gene was depleted is easily explained by its function in the pathway downstream of IDP biosynthesis. Although some accumulation of the precursors IDP and DMADP could be expected by blocking yqiD, no significant differences in the flux toward the isoprene emission were detected. Apparently the efflux of isoprene is not influenced by the changes in FDP synthesis downstream in the isoprenoid pathway. This can be regarded as a contradiction to the hypothesis that isoprene emission functions as an efflux of an overflow metabolite.In this study the involvement of several B. subtilis genes in the MEP pathway to isoprene was established by studying isoprene emission of mutants. Five genes, essential for viability, yluB, yacM, yabH, yacN, and yqfP, were shown to be essential for the isoprene production as well. Where these genes were at first instance depicted based on homology of the encoding proteins, the results of this study proved the functional involvement of the genes in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids on a biochemical level. A knockout of the sixth candidate gene, yqfY, did not yield a reduction in isoprene emission, nor a growth retardation, which might be explained by a not fully repressed Pspac promoter present in vector pMUTIN3. Knock-outs of the two other genes investigated in this study, showing no growth retardation as well as no reduction in isoprene emission, behaved in accordance with expectation.Although it remains unknown why isoprene is emitted by bacteria, the knowledge about the pathway to isoprene can be used for further investigations towards a better understanding of the metabolic flux to IDP and its physiological function. Next to that the IDP pool can be optimized by metabolic pathway engineering, creating a B. subtilis strain as an efficient Gram-positive host for the heterologous production of terpenoids, like the valuable plant-derived pharmaceuticals artemisinin and paclitaxel. The potential of using heterologous production organisms for the supply of terpenoids is already under investigation for E. coli and for several yeast strains (Martin et al.; Lindahl et al.; Ro et al.; Dejong et al.). For the purpose of metabolic pathway engineering it is interesting to search for a gene encoding isoprene synthase in B. subtilis as well. Evidence for an enzymatic bioconversion and the identification of this specific enzyme could give the possibility to block the efflux of isoprene thereby increasing the amount of isoprenoid available for the synthesis of terpenoids.",
32,TA049273,10.1371/journal.pone.0186020,Phytochemical residue profiles in rice grains fumigated with essential oils forthe control of rice weevil.,"In the present study, we investigated the fumigant potential of five edibleessential oils (EOs) against Sitophilus oryzae and their phytochemical residuesin treated grains. Among the tested EOs, peppermint oil proved significantlyeffective (P ≤ 0.05) on S.oryzae at 400 μl/L air concentration, inducing 83 and100% mortalities in with-food and without-food conditions respectively over 72 hexposure. In addition, it was also observed that the binary mixtures ofpeppermint + lemon oil (1:1 ratio) produced an equivalent effect to that ofpeppermint oil alone treatments. The phytochemical residue analysis by GC-MSrevealed the presence of six compounds upon 72 h exposure to EOs. Further, theanalysis of physico-chemical properties of the compounds indicated a positivecorrelation between polar surface area (PSA) and its residual nature. The residuelevels of eugenol were significantly elevated corresponding to its high PSA value(29) in clove and cinnamon oils. On the other hand, the compounds with zero PSAvalue imparted very less or no (D-Limonene, caryophyllene, pinene andterpinolene) residues in treated grains. With respect to the most activepeppermint oil, L-menthone, menthyl acetate and eucalyptol residues were at 67,41 and 23% levels respectively. The outcome of the present study indicate thepeppermint oil as a potent fumigant against S. oryzae, and although the residuesof phytochemicals in treated grains is higher; they belong to the generallyrecognised as safe (GRAS) status leaving no harmful effect.","Vendan, S Ezhil, Manivannan, S, Sunny, Anila M, Murugesan, R",2017,PloS one,2,False,False,True,"Plant essential oils (EOs) are considered as alternatives to conventional pesticides and have been well documented for their toxicity on stored product insect pests. Nearly, 3000 EOs has been reported from plants and about 10% of oils are commercially used as flavour and fragrants. Naturally, EOs are derived from different parts of plant tissues, which play a vital role in plant defense system. The EOs comprises of complex mixture of phytochemicals belonging to multiple groups and is responsible for various bioactivities in target insect pests. Among the phytochemicals in EOs, terpenes are known to have high vapour pressure and can easily diffuse in air at normal atmosphere. Monoterpenes (C10H16) are volatile in nature and are responsible for fumigant actions in EOs. Many studies have demonstrated the fumigant action of monoterpenes (e.g., limonene, menthone, eugenol, eucalyptol and menthol) against a range of insect pests.Most recently, Isman and Grieneisen stated that insecticide research on essential oils has increased nearly 15% during the past decade. However, no information is available in the literature regarding the commercialization of EO based fumigants for stored product insect control. In India, phytochemical based pesticides for commercial use are very less and EO based fumigants are nil as per Central Insecticides Board and Registration Committee. Thus, alternative strategies and adequate data are required to formulate EO based fumigants. Rajendran and Sriranjini had suggested that, further studies are required to understand the phytochemical residue/sorption levels on different food commodities and in EOs mixtures to validate the potentiality of EO based fumigants for stored product insect pest control. However, very less reports are available currently on the phytochemical residual analysis in EO fumigated commodities considering their high molecular weight and low vapour pressure. Similarly, the data on commercial use of EOs as food preservative agents remains unclear in the context of phytochemical residues and their toxicities.The rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) is one of the most destructive and cosmopolitan insect pest of stored cereals worldwide. Presently, phosphine is predominantly used across the globe to eradicate this pest species effectively from the infested commodities. Due to resistance development in insects, the target concentration of phosphine required to achieve 100% insect control has increased from 80 ppm to 1000 ppm during the years 1992 to 2001. Reddy et al. stated that, complete mortality of Sitophilus spp. population can be achieved at a dosage of 1 g/m3 phosphine held for seven days. Consequently, it is also known that, S. oryzae is one of the most tolerant species and had rapidly developed strong resistance to phosphine. A wide range of plant based EOs have been screened for insecticidal activity targeting different modes of action on different insect species. However, the reports pertaining to phytochemical residue analysis on fumigated commodities still remains less. Therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to validate the fumigant potential of five edible EOs viz., Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), Clove (Syzygium aromaticum), Lemon (Citrus limon L.), Orange (Citrus aurantium) and Peppermint (Mentha piperita) against S. oryzae and to determine their phytochemical residues in treated rice grains. The fumigant toxicity of EOs on S. oryzae was compared in with and without-food conditions and the residual levels of active ingredients were also analysed. In addition, composition and physico-chemical properties of phytochemicals have been correlated with their residual property and accordingly discussed in this article.","HPLC grade solvents, EOs of five selected plants viz., cinnamon, clove, lemon, orange and peppermint and phytochemicals (eucalyptol, neoisocarvomenthol, menthone and menthyl acetate) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Ltd, India. Aluminium phosphide tablets ‘Quickphos’ (United Phosphorus Ltd., Mumbai, India) was obtained from commercial pesticide supplier. Rice grains (Raw rice, MR-gold variety) used for the experiment was procured from Local Super Market, Mysore, Karnataka, India. The obtained rice grains were held at -20°C in deep freezer (Blue Star, HF 300 model) for a week to disinfest any field carried infestation. The typical moisture content of the rice grains used for the experiment was about 12%.Insect cultures of rice weevil, S. oryzae was regularly maintained in the insectary unit (with controlled condition 30±2°C, 75±5% humidity and 13:11—light:dark photoperiod) in Food Protectants and Infestation Control department at CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore. A group (approximately 1000 individuals) of S. oryzae adults obtained from the stock culture were introduced into 2 L capacity individual glass jars containing 1 Kg rice grains. The insect culture was under regular observation until enough adults were developed. From this sub culture, adults of similar age groups were obtained and used for fumigant toxicity studies.Individual EOs, phytochemicals and binary mixtures of EOs were performed in fumigant bioassays. Glass tubes (28 x 114 mm; 50 ml capacity) fitted with glass stoppers were used for performing the fumigation bioassays. Whatmann No. 1 filter paper strips (20 mm square) were prepared and pasted to the lower side of stopper. The top layer of each tube (about one inch length from the filter paper) was lined with Insect-A-slip to avoid insects coming in direct contact with the filter paper strips. All EOs, phytochemicals and binary mixtures were evaluated for fumigant toxicity both in with and without-food conditions. For fumigant bioassays under with-food conditions, 5 gm of rice was added to each tube. Ten individual adults of 15 days old were released into each tube. Among them, three highly active EOs were chosen to study the effect of binary mixtures of EO combinations in 1:1 ratio. Based on the individual EO fumigant bioassay results, major phytocompounds from the most active EO was selected for further studies. Different concentrations viz., 20, 100, 200, 400 μl/L air of EOs (including binary mixtures i.e., peppermint+lemon, peppermint+orange and lemon+orange) and phytocompound samples were loaded onto the filter paper. After loading each test concentrations, the open end of the individual tube was held with stoppers and further sealed with thin polythene films to make it air tight. Phosphine gas was used as a positive control for the phytocompound fumigant bioassay. Phosphine gas generation and fumigant dosing at various concentrations (20, 100, 200, 400 μl/L air) was carried out by following Manivannan et al., method. Three sets were maintained for each of the treatment to observe mortalities at 24, 48 and 72 h exposures respectively. Likewise, the entire experiment was repeated in five replications.After 72 h exposure to respective EOs, the treated rice samples were extracted from the tubes and were subjected to phytochemical residue analysis. The fumigated rice grains obtained from all the five replicates were pooled together for phytochemical residue analysis. Accordingly, twenty-five grams of rice in each concentration was soaked in methanol at 1:3 (rice: methanol; w/v) ratio. The residual extract of each sample was collected and filtered through Whatmann No. 1 filter paper. Likewise, the extraction procedure was repeated thrice for each test sample. Obtained residual extracts were concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator. The final concentrates of the phytochemical extracts were stored in deep freezer (-20°C) for further GC-MS analysis.The GC-MS analysis was performed on a Perkinelmer system equipped with Turbo mass Gold mass spectrometer (Norwalk, CT. USA). Elite-5 capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) was used for analysis. Helium served as the carrier gas and all the samples were analyzed by the following specifications; Initial temp 40°C for 2 min, ramp 5°C/min to 290°C, Inj = 250°C, Volume = 1 μL, Split = 10:1, Delay: 5.00 min, Transfer Temp = 200°C, Source Temp = 180°C, Scan: 29 to 400Da. Compounds were identified by comparison of their respective mass spectra, retention indices (Kovats index) and above 40% of relative abundance of acceptance match criteria with those of standards and by comparing with the NIST mass spectral data system/library.After the fumigant bioassays were complete, the per cent corrected mortalities were estimated following Abbot’s formula for each of the treatment and represented along with their mean and standard error; percentage corrected mortality = (percentage mortality in treatment—percentage mortality in control/100—percentage mortality in control) x 100. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple range tests were performed for the mortality data to determine the significant difference between treatments and to identify the effective treatment at P ≤ 0.05 for further binary mixture studies. Lethal concentration for 50% mortality (LC50) was estimated for 72 h exposure for all the EOs and binary mixtures by probit analysis. ANOVA and probit analysis were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 16.0). From the GC-MS data, relative concentration (RLC) and residue concentration (RSC) of each component in percentage was calculated by following formulas: RLC = (Component area / Total area) x 100; RSC = [(Sample area x Volume of sample) / (Reference area x Volume of reference)] x 100.","The results indicated that all the tested EOs in without-food condition exhibited concentration vs time dependent activities on S. oryzae (Table 1). After 24 h exposure, no or remarkable mortality was observed in any of the treatments, except for orange and peppermint oils which recorded 40 and 34 per cent mortalities at 400 μl/L air concentration. A minimum test concentration of 100 μl/L air was required to achieve more than 10% of mortality in S. oryzae for all the EO treatments exposed for 48 h. Among the five tested EOs, peppermint, lemon and orange oils displayed significant potential activities (>95 per cent mortality) at 400 μl/L air concentration exposed to S. oryzae over 72 h exposure (P ≤ 0.05). Complete adult mortality was recorded in peppermint and lemon oils treatments at maximum test concentration and long exposures.Mortality of the test insects decreased in fumigant bioassays carried out under with-food conditions (Table 2) than without-food (Table 1). Similar to without-food assay, adult mortality was also dependent on the concentration and exposure. However, lemon and orange oils exhibited moderate activities (55 and 46 respectively) at higher concentration and longer exposure. Maximum mortality (83%) was observed in peppermint oil treatment at 400 μl/L air concentration over 72 h exposure. Among the tested EOs, peppermint oil showed significant activities at P ≤ 0.05 at the test concentrations from 100 to 400 μl/L air over 72 h exposure.The fumigant toxicities of selected four phytocompounds on S. oryzae are depicted in Table 3. Complete mortality (100%) of S. oryzae was observed in eucalyptol and menthone treatments at 200 and 400 μl/L air concentrations over 72 h exposure under without-food conditions. In with-food condition, more than 80% mortality was recorded for eucalyptol and menthone treatments at the highest test concentrations and maximum exposure. When compared to phosphine treatment (positive control), eucalyptol and menthone showed significant activities at P ≤ 0.05 in without and with-food conditions for 400 μl/L air concentration at 72 h exposure. Followed by eucalyptol and menthone, menthyl acetate also exhibited fumigant activities. No significant mortality was noticed for neoisocarvomenthol treatments over 24 h exposure, either in without-food or with-food condition.The results of the binary mixtures of EOs from lemon, orange and peppermint oils tested against the adults of S. oryzae are presented in Table 4. All the tested binary mixtures of EOs expressed mortalities following 24 h exposure. Insect mortalities decreased in with-food assay compared to the without-food assay. Peppermint+lemon oil mixture displayed promising activities compared to other binary mixtures exposed for 72 h. The obtained mortalities over exposure to the test concentration of 400 μl/L air for 48 and 72 h exposure was significantly superior (P ≤ 0.05) over the other binary mixtures, resulting in 95 to 100% mortality.The estimated probit analysis data for S. oryzae exposed to individual EOs, phytocompounds and binary mixtures of EOs for 72 h exposure are shown in Table 5. The LC50 concentrations recorded for orange and lemon oils were less than 65 and 550 μl/L air concentration for without-food and with-food exposures respectively. Peppermint oil proved to be the potent EO fumigant, recording the least LC50 (47.8 μl/L air) and LC90 (124.4 μl/L air) values for without-food exposure compared to the other EOs. Similarly, the peppermint oil treatment also exhibited promising toxicity on S. oryzae under with-food conditions, recording least LC50 (45.2 μl/L air) and LC90 (1372.8 μl/L air) values. Moreover, the estimated fiducial limits for LC50 and LC90 concentrations, cinnamon and clove oils showed wide ranges with maximum lethal concentration values. On the other hand, the most active peppermint oil showed narrow range of fiducial limits; 32.0–66.4 and 87.2–219.6 μl/L air ranges obtained for without-food exposure and 28.0–63.4 and 732.0–3993.4 μl/L air ranges obtained for with-food exposure (LC50 and LC90 respectively). Compared to the positive control (phosphine), the phytocompounds eucalyptol and menthone showed notable LC50 and LC90 values than neoisocarvomenthol and menthyl acetate in fumigation bioassays. The LC50 and LC90 values were <55 and <150 μl/L air in without-food condition and <110 and <300 μl/L air in without-food condition for eucalyptol and menthone respectively. In the EO binary mixture bioassays, the minimal LC50 and LC90 values were noticed in peppermint+lemon oil mixture. Less than 100 μl/L air values of LC50 and LC90 values of 427.8 and 1425.4 μl/L air were obtained for peppermint+lemon oil combination in without-food and with-food exposures respectively. Narrow range of fiducial limits was obtained for peppermint+lemon oil combination than the other treatments.Phytochemical composition and RLC of compounds obtained from the tested EOs are presented in Table 6. GC-MS analysis revealed that, cinnamon, clove, orange, lemon and peppermint oils contained a total of 27, 17, 25, 23 and 25 compounds respectively. The following are the major compounds identified in the selected EOs; eugenol detected in cinnamon (76.76%) and clove (74.55%) oils, D-limonene in orange (93.48%) oil, D-limonene and α-pinene in lemon (66.60 and 17.30% respectively) oil, and neoisocarvomenthol, 1-menthone and eucalyptol in peppermint (40.55, 27.62 and 10.61% respectively) oil. The phytochemicals were classified into five categories based on the RLC levels (I = 0–5%, II = 6–20%, III = 21–45%, IV = 46–70%, V = 71–100%) in EOs for comparative analysis and presented in Table 7. No RLC value is depicted in the Table for the EO with level I, except for eugenol in orange oil which showed reasonable traces of RSC in the treated samples. The results suggest that the RSC values did not correspond to their respective RLC levels recorded in the study. Over all, about six compounds were only detected as residues in the fumigated rice grains. Menthone, menthyl acetate and eucalyptol residues were detected in peppermint oil treatments. While, eugenol residue was detected in cinnamon, clove and orange oil treatments and D-limonene and acetyl eugenol in lemon and clove oil treatments respectively. Menthone showed maximum RSC value (67.28%) followed by menthyl acetate, eucalyptol, eugenol, acetyl eugenol and D-limonene with 41.77, 23.50, 18.86 and 1.57% RSC’s respectively. While comparing the RSC of a compound with its total composition in the EO, eugenol showed maximum RSC (about 15% in clove and 20% in cinnamon oils). Fig 1 shows GC MS chromatogram of residual compounds detected in rice grains fumigated with peppermint oil. Physico-chemical properties of phytochemicals of EOs were compared with two conventional fumigants, phosphine and methyl bromide (S1 Table). RSC level was the least or nil for the compounds having zero polar surface area (PSA) and no remarkable variation was observed between the RSC and physico-chemical properties of the compounds except PSA.","In spite of many investigations to explore the potential of bio-fumigants for stored product insect control, the major disadvantage is the low vapor pressure and high boiling point leading to absorption/ settling of residues on the treated commodities imparting off odors. Hence, in the present study, we comparatively investigated the fumigant toxic potentialities and the residue profiles of cinnamon, clove, lemon, orange and peppermint EOs in fumigated rice grains. Insect mortality results revealed that, all the tested EOs exerted concentration dependent toxic effects on S. oryzae. Peppermint oil was regarded as highly toxic; while lemon and orange oils were reported to be moderately toxic to S. oryzae. Previously, Khani et al. and Shaaya et al. reported 85 and 7.5 μl/L air as the LC50 concentrations for peppermint oil treatments against S. oryzae. Whereas in the present study, LC50 values of 47.8 (LCL:UCL = 32.0–66.4) and 45.2 μl/L air (LCL:UCL = 28.0–63.4) were recorded for peppermint oil in both with and without-food conditions. The LC90 values for peppermint oil increased in with-food conditions (124.4 to 1372 μl/L air) compared to without-food conditions as similar to the other oils. The obtained slope values significantly decreased (P ≤ 0.05) in with-food conditions for all oils except for the less active cinnamon oil. Hence, it was predicted that fumigant toxicities of EOs decreased under with-food conditions indicating that a proportion of active ingredients/phytochemicals might have got absorbed/adhered onto the rice grains thereby reducing the lethality. Similarly, Rajendran and Sriranjini stated that the toxicity of bio-fumigants against insect pests will be less in with-food conditions due to low vapour pressure (≤1 mmHg) and high sorption by the grains.Based on the toxicity data of the individual oils, peppermint, orange and lemon oils were selected for the binary mixture fumigant bioassays on S. oryzae. Mortality results showed that, S. oryzae was more susceptible to peppermint with lemon oil mixture at P ≤ 0.05. This mixture expressed 100% mortality at 400 μl/L air concentration in without-food condition, which decreased to 85% mortality in with-food condition exposed for 72 h. It was observed that peppermint+ lemon oil mixture (1:1) had more fumigant action than the other two mixtures. Earlier bioactivity studies have indicated that the mixtures of essential oils are more effective than individual oils. For example, Krishnarajah et al. reported that, binary mixtures of essential oils were more toxic to Sitotroga cerealella than the individual oils. This also holds good for conventional fumigants like phosphine, which showed synergistic effects on Rhyzopertha dominica when combined with CO2, and the report suggested that PH3+CO2 admixture increased the insect mortality than phosphine alone treatments. While in the present study, fumigant toxicity of peppermint oil alone was relatively par to peppermint+lemon oil mixture. Similarly, Nattudurai et al. observed that eucalyptus+camphor oil mixture had similar effects (LC50) on Tribolium castaneum as posed by the individual oils. In the present study, similar to the results of individual oils, the slope values for the binary mixtures greatly varied between with and without-food conditions. This strongly indicated that the toxicity of EOs is altered by the sorptive nature of the commodity.Monoterpenoids in EOs are known to play a vital role in mitigating fumigant actions on stored product insect pests. Consequently in the present study, peppermint oil showed promising activities due to the presence of major monoterpenoids such as eucalyptol and menthone. When compared to the commercial fumigant (phosphine), menthone and eucalyptol alone treatments showed significant activities at P ≤ 0.05 and were identified as active compounds in peppermint oil exhibiting fumigant activities. Likewise, orange and lemon oils offered moderate toxicities on S. oryzae attributed by the presence of D-limonene and α-pinene monoterpenoid compounds. Previously, Lee et al. suggested that menthone had more fumigant potential followed by α-pinene and limonene. Later, eucalyptol was also recognised as potent fumigant against S. oryzae, T. castaneum and R. dominica as described by Lee et al.. The present study also insists the fact that, not all monoterpenoids found in EOs possess fumigant actions. Though, eugenol belongs to monoterpenoid group, it displayed less activity against S. oryzae, despite having a RLC value around 75% in cinnamon and clove oils. Similarly, Liska et al. also reported that eugenol was not effective as a fumigant against T. castaneum.It is imperative that, a thorough knowledge on residual properties of EOs is essential to formulate a bio-fumigant. The present phytochemical residual analysis revealed that, only six compounds settle/adhere on the rice grains out of the total detected compounds in individual EO. Among the tested five EOs, phytochemical residues of eugenol (14–20% of RSC per oil) was remarkably higher in clove and cinnamon oils than the other oils. Further, it was also observed that RSC of phytochemicals were associated with their respective PSAs. It is known that PSA is the electrostatic potential of a substance/compound to form physical interactions between surfaces. Palm et al. stated that PSA has been used for prediction of absorption of drugs in pharmaceutical industry. Accordingly, in the present study, we propose a positive correlation between the PSA values of phytocompounds from EOs with their residual nature. For instance, the residues of major compounds like acetyl eugenol, eucalyptol, eugenol, L-menthone and menthyl acetate were more and correlated with their respective PSA values. The phytochemical analysis of eugenol showed notable RLC and corresponding RSC levels in cinnamon and clove oils. While for orange oil, though the RLC level was very low for eugenol, remarkable RSC was noticed due to its high PSA value (29). Similarly, the RLC values were less for acetyl eugenol and menthyl acetate compounds, whereas the RSC values were more, mainly attributed by its high PSA values (36 and 26 respectively). Contrastingly it was observed that, though D-limonene was a major compound in orange (93%) and lemon (66%) oils, the obtained RSC was very less (0.10% of RSC per oil) in lemon and was not detected in orange oil, due to its zero PSA value. Similarly, the PSA value for the other non-residual compounds such as caryophyllene, pinene and terpinolene is zero though their RLC values were about 6–20% in the respective oils. More interestingly, PSA value and RLC level of L-menthone was less in peppermint oil when compared to eugenol in cinnamon and clove oils though the detected residues were very high (40–70%). In contrast, though PSA and RLC values were at noticeable levels for isomenthol and neoisocarvomenthol compounds they did not impart any residue in the fumigated rice grains. These facts denote the instability of the compounds and probable chemical reactions taking place during fumigations. To support this view, Belitz et al., stated that terpene hydrocarbons undergo rapid autooxidation at atmospheric air in many of the essential oils. Hence it was assumed/predicted that menthol isomers (isomenthol and neoisocarvomenthol) might have autooxidized to L-menthone leading to more residue formation. In addition, it is known that isomenthol and neoisocarvomenthol were not stable when compared to menthol because of an axial methyl group and may rapidly get oxidized to menthone. Interestingly, in the present study it was noticed that insect mortality was nil for neoisocarvomenthol in with-food condition and about 50% mortality (at 400 μl/L air concentration and 72 h exposure) was observed in without-food condition. Probably, it was assumed that, in without-food condition, direct exposure/contact of oxidized neoisocarvomenthol (i.e., menthone) on insects might have induced mortality. On the other hand, in with-food condition, a proportion of oxidized neoisocarvomenthol might have settled on rice grains and the actual concentration required to induce insect mortality may be lacking. Krishnaswamy described the oxidation mechanism of menthol and their isomers into menthone isomers. Furthermore, Pecar and Gorsek had described the reaction kinetics of menthol getting oxidized to menthone under laboratory conditions. According to Lee et al., residual level of phytocompound on the commodity is dependent on the quantity of compound being absorbed. In addition, Cartalade and Vernhet stated that, maximum adsorption of phytochemical was associated to the PSA of the material. Similarly, in the present study, the compounds such as acetyl eugenol, eugenol, menthone and menthyl acetate have more PSA values subsequently imparting higher levels of residues in treated grains. Hence, it is proposed that the PSA value may determine the residual property of compounds getting adhered to the surface of commodity.Furthermore, Reddy et al. stated that sorption/residue of fumigants on commodities is mainly dependent on the moisture content of the grain, size of particle, composition of fumigant agent, exposure phase and dose. Likewise, the conventional fumigants, phosphine and methyl bromide have zero PSA value thereby the residue formation in fumigated commodities will be very less.","Our study signifies that peppermint oil is a potent bio/phyto-fumigant and could be used for the control of S. oryzae under storage conditions. In addition, the study implies that peppermint oil can also be used in mixed form with lemon oil for effective fumigations. With respect to the phytochemical residues, the identified major residual compounds such as 1-menthone, menthyl acteate, eucalyptal and eugenol, and their respective oils are generally recognised as safe (GRAS). Accordingly, we study suggests that, peppermint and lemon oils can be considered as safer alternatives for commodity treatments. Also, the phytochemical residues could be probably removed by 24 hours aeration, as suggested by Lee et al. for eucalyptol compound. Likely, the residual compounds in peppermint oil fumigated grains may also be removed upon aeration. In addition, Isman reviewed that residues from edible EOs are beneficial to human health by pass through diet. Furthermore, peppermint oil is exempted from Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) for pesticide formulation in alone or in combination with other ingredients. Hence, our study suggests peppermint oil as a potent bio-fumigant and could be applied with the reduced residual risk under direct exposure to commodities in alone or in mixture with lemon oil for the control of S. oryzae in stored product commodities."

Furthermore, theincreased use of chemical fertilizers has given rise to numerous environmentalproblems and health risks. Presently, there is a transition towardsbiofertilizers to enhance crops' yield, encompassing medicinal and aromaticvarieties. METHODS: This study aimed to explore the impacts of plantgrowth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), both independently and in conjunction witharbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), on various morphological, physiological, andphytochemical characteristics of Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss. Thisexperimentation took place under different irrigation conditions. The irrigationschemes encompassed well watering (WW), mild water stress (MWS), and severe waterstress (SWS). The study evaluated the effects of various biofertilizers,including AMF, PGPR, and the combined application of both AMF and PGPR (AMF +PGPR), compared to a control group where no biofertilizers were applied. RESULTS:The findings of the study revealed that under water-stress conditions, the dryyield and relative water content of D. kotschyi Boiss. experienced a decline.However, the application of AMF, PGPR, and AMF + PGPR led to an enhancement indry yield and relative water content compared to the control group. Among thetreatments, the co-application of AMF and PGPR in plants subjected to wellwatering (WW) exhibited the tallest growth (65 cm), the highest leaf count (187),and the most elevated chlorophyll a (0.59 mg g(-1) fw) and b (0.24 mg g(-1) fw)content. Regarding essential oil production, the maximum content (1.29%) andyield (0.13 g plant (-1)) were obtained from mild water stress (MWS) treatment.The co-application of AMF and PGPR resulted in the highest essential oil contentand yield (1.31% and 0.15 g plant(-1), respectively). The analysis of D. kotschyiBoiss. essential oil identified twenty-six compounds, with major constituentsincluding geranyl acetate (11.4-18.88%), alpha-pinene (9.33-15.08%), Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (8.43-12.8%), neral (6.80-9.32%), geranial(9.23-11.91%), and limonene (5.56-9.12%). Notably, the highest content of geranylacetate, geranial, limonene, and alpha-pinene was observed in plants subjected toMWS treatment following AMF + PGPR application. Furthermore, the co-applicationof AMF, PGPR, and severe water stress (SWS) notably increased the total solublesugar (TSS) and proline content. In conclusion, the results indicate that thecombined application of AMF and PGPR can effectively enhance the quantity andquality of essential oil in D. kotschyi Boiss., particularly when the plants areexposed to water deficit stress conditions.","Gasemi, Saeid, Mahdavikia, Hassan, Rezaei-Chiyaneh, Esmaeil, Banaei-Asl, Farzad, Dolatabadian, Aria, Sadeghpour, Amir",2023,PeerJ,2,False,False,True,"Iran receives approximately two-thirds less rainfall than the global average. Over 88% of Iran’s farmlands are in arid and semi-arid regions. Water scarcity conditions, or drought stress, have a detrimental impact on plant functioning. This includes a decrease in root growth and nutrient absorption, a reduction in photosynthesis capacity, and an increase in the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation within the plant’s membranes. Plants’ reaction to water deficit stress is contingent upon its severity and duration, leading to a decrease in plant productivity ranging from 13% to 94%.Furthermore, insufficient soil moisture diminishes the activity of the microbial population. This decrease hampers the accessibility and solubility of nutrients for plants. Moreover, the increased utilization of chemical fertilizers to attain peak crop yields amplifies production expenses, elevates the risk of environmental pollution, and poses threats to both human and animal well-being. Utilizing biofertilizers such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) to decrease or even eliminate chemical input usage presents a commendable resolution to address these apprehensions within the realm of sustainable agriculture. Biofertilizers contain beneficial bacteria and fungi that convert essential nutrients from inaccessible to accessible forms during biological processes. Studies have indicated that PGPR can stimulate plant development by producing diverse compounds. These bacteria assist in element absorption, atmospheric nitrogen stabilization, mineral solubilization like phosphate, and the synthesis of plant hormones such as auxins and gibberellins. These activities collectively enhance plant performance.Furthermore, PGPR can alleviate the adverse effects of stressful conditions such as drought and salinity. They achieve this by modifying root morphology, augmenting the buildup of osmolytes within plant cells, and enhancing water uptake mechanisms. Inoculating plant roots with AMF presents another auspicious and productive approach to enhancing plant performance and resilience under drought-stress conditions. The symbiotic relationship between AMF and over 80% of plant species has a constructive impact on plant growth. It achieves this by augmenting the uptake of inorganic nutrients and water, elevating the rate of photosynthesis, and fostering the production of both primary and secondary metabolites. These metabolites are pivotal in bolstering plants’ ability to withstand and endure stressful conditions. One of the viable strategies for achieving thriving agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions involves cultivating drought-resistant plants. Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) cultivation has gained prominence in these challenging environments due to their remarkable resilience to adverse conditions. Despite stress, MAPs can sustain their performance by synthesizing secondary metabolites, including alkaloids and phenolic compounds. indicated that water deficit stress decreased chlorophyll content, relative water content, grain yield, biological yield, and essential oil yield of dragon head compared to the control. showed that applying AMF and PGPR while reducing the adverse effects of drought stress by providing nutrients of N, P, and K improves the quality of fennel essential oil. stated that the application of AMF and PGPR on Melissa officinalis L. plants could alleviate the adverse effects of water scarcity by boosting leaf water potential, the efficiency of carbon dioxide use, transpiration rate, nutrient availability, water supply to roots. Moreover, Melissa officinalis L. plants’ growth, development, and dry weight yield can also improve under water deficit stress.Dragon head (D. kotschyi Boiss.) is a member of the Lamiaceae family and holds the distinction of being an endemic and endangered plant species native to Iran. This plant possesses antispasmodic, antibacterial, and analgesic properties, making it extensively utilized for addressing issues such as pain, seizures, fever, inflammation, rheumatic pain, and wound healing. It has been reported that the main constituents of essential oil (EO) in D. kotschyi Boiss. differ due to different environmental conditions but mainly include α-pinene, limonene, β-bourbonene, geranial, terpinene-4-ol, etc.. Limonene, one of the main components of D. kotschyi Boiss. EO is effective as an anti-tumour, antiviral, bactericidal, cancer prevention agent, anti-candida, expectorant, fungus growth inhibitor, anti-spasm and pain reliever.Furthermore, beyond diminishing the effectiveness of chemical fertilizers under water scarcity conditions, the extensive application of these fertilizers also adversely impacts the bioactive compounds in MAPs. Hence, substituting chemical fertilizers with environmentally friendly biofertilizers to enhance nutrient uptake and augment plant resilience to water stress becomes imperative. Moreover, the impact of biofertilizers on perennial plants, such as cumin, remains inadequately investigated under drought stress circumstances, and there exists a dearth of substantial information in this domain.Consequently, the primary objective of this study was to delve into the influence of AMF and plant PGPR on the agronomic traits, dry yield, and the phytochemical and physiological characteristics of D. kotschyi Boiss. cultivated under conditions of water scarcity. Our working hypotheses were as follows: (i) the combined application of AMF and PGPR would alleviate the adverse effects caused by water deficit stress; (ii) the introduction of AMF and PGPR would enhance both the quantity and quality of essential oil production under water deficit stress conditions; and (iii) the inoculation of AMF and PGPR would contribute to improved growth, biochemical attributes, and physiological responses in D. kotschyi Boiss. when confronted with water deficit stress.","The study was undertaken during the 2019 growing season within a controlled environment at Shahid Bakri Miandoab, situated in West Azerbaijan, Iran (45°10′E, 37°44′N, and an elevation of 1,338 m above sea level). The primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of distinct irrigation regimes and biofertilizers on the morphological, physiological, and phytochemical attributes of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. The experimental design employed a factorial approach within a randomized complete block arrangement, with each treatment combination being replicated three times. The initial factor under investigation pertained to distinct irrigation regimes, namely optimal irrigation, denoted watering at 100% field capacity (WW) to maintain moisture without inducing stress; moderate water stress involving irrigation at 80% field capacity (MWS); and pronounced water stress entailing irrigation at 60% field capacity (SWS). The second factor centered on the administration of biofertilizers, encompassing a control group devoid of biofertilizer application, the introduction of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), and a concurrent application of both AMF and PGPR. Table 1 presents a comprehensive summary of the chemical and physical attributes of the soil, analyzed at a depth ranging from 0 to 30 cm. Meanwhile, Figure 1 depicts the average monthly rainfall and air temperature measurements.The experimental arrangement entailed the utilization of pots with dimensions measuring 80 × 25 × 25 cm, each uniformly filled with soil to an equivalent level. Ten plants were cultivated within each pot, and the planting commenced in mid-March. The plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), acquired from Green Biotech Ltd., recognized as Zist Fanavar Sabz in Persian, constituted a composite comprising phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (Bacillus lentus and Pseudomonas putida) at a concentration of 109 active bacteria per gram, nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Azotobacter) at a concentration of 109 active bacteria per gram, and potassium-solubilizing bacteria (Pseudomonas genus) at a concentration of 108 active bacteria per gram. The contents of the packets were blended with sterile distilled water and subsequently applied as a spray onto the seeds of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. This procedure ensured the establishment of a consistent coating on the seed surface. The biofertilizer containing AMF, specifically Myco-root® sourced from Zist Fanavar Sabz Company in Iran, encompassed a trio of species: Glomus mossea, Glomus etunicatum, and Glomus intraradices. This study introduced the AMF biofertilizer into the designated treatments by incorporating it into the soil beneath the planted seedlings. For each pot, 50 grams of the AMF treatment were meticulously combined with the soil. The cultivation area was divided into six rows, each spaced at a 10 cm interval. Subsequently, the seedlings were positioned within the same row, maintaining a separation of 10 cm between each seedling, and were planted at a depth of three cm.During the stage of 50% flowering, a random selection of five plants was made from each pot to evaluate yield components and agronomic characteristics. The above-ground portion of the Dorema kotschyi Boiss. The plant was harvested and dried in a forced-air oven set at 68 °C for 72 h. Following a two-day interval, the dried plant material was weighed to ascertain the dry yield measure.The D. kotschyi Boiss. EO was extracted from 40 g dried aerial parts, ground and inserted into 1 L glass flasks filled with 300 mL of distilled water. Then, they were boiled for 3 h to exhaust the whole plant material. The EO was collected in specific glass containers after adding sodium sulphate and kept at 4 °C in the darkness until GC-FID and GC–MS analyses. Also, the EO yield, as g plant−1, was calculated by multiplying the dry yield with EO content. After extraction of EO, the required amount of sodium sulphate was added, and samples were kept at 4 °C in darkness for further chemical analysis.Moreover, the EO constituents of D. kotschyi Boiss. were analyzed using GC-MS (7890/5975A GC/MSD; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and GC-FID (7990B; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). For GC–MS analysis, an Agilent 7890A-5975C gas chromatograph manufactured in the United States was employed. This chromatograph was equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column comprising a 5% phenyl methylpolysiloxane composition, with dimensions of 30 m in length, an inner diameter of 0.25 mm, and a film thickness of 0.25 µm. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: an initial duration of 3 min at 80 °C, followed by a subsequent increase of 8 °C per minute until reaching 180 °C, which was then maintained for 10 min. The transfer line temperature was set at 240 °C. The carrier gas employed was helium, flowing at 1 ml per minute. The injector employed a split ratio of 1:50, and mass range acquisition occurred within the range of 40 to 500 m/z in electron impact (EI) mode at an energy of 70 electron volts (eV). The essential oil constituents (EO) were identified per the procedure outlined by. In brief, the components’ retention indices (RIs) were determined by comparing them with a standard mixture of n-alkanes (C7-C28) from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The calculated RIs and the corresponding mass spectra were compared against entries within commercial libraries and existing literature sources (; NIST 08, 2008). To aid in identifying the major components, authentic standards available from Sigma-Aldrich were also co-injected. An Agilent 7890, an instrument produced by Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) was utilized for the GC-FID analysis. This instrument was coupled with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and an HP-5 capillary column identical to the previous one. The oven temperature profile remained consistent with the conditions above. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 230 °C and 240 °C, respectively. The quantification, presented as relative percentages, was carried out following the procedure established by.During the flowering stage, fresh leaf samples weighing 0.5 g were subjected to homogenization in 10 ml of 80% acetone. The resultant homogenate underwent centrifugation at 12,000 g and a temperature of 4 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was measured at wavelengths of 663 nm, 645 nm, and 470 nm, employing a UV spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan).The quantification of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid content was accomplished using the equations established by. The units for plant pigments were expressed as milligrams per gram of fresh weight.    The weight of ten mature leaves was determined as their initial fresh weight (LFW). Subsequently, these samples were placed in distilled water at a temperature of 4 °C, and the weight of the turgid leaves was recorded after 24 h (LTW). Following this, the leaves were dried in an oven set at 70 °C for 48 h, and their weight as dry leaves was measured (LDW). Lastly, the relative water content (RWC) was computed using the formula provided by.  Fresh leaf samples weighing 0.5 grams each were pulverized using liquid nitrogen. These ground samples were combined with a 10 ml solution containing 3% sulfosalicylic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 times the force of gravity (g) for 10 min. Following centrifugation, 2 ml of the resulting supernatant was carefully transferred into a fresh tube. To this supernatant, 2 ml of acid-ninhydrin solution and 2 ml of glacial acetic acid were added and thoroughly mixed.The resulting mixtures were then subjected to heat within a water bath set at 100 °C for one hour. Subsequently, the mixtures were rapidly cooled by placing them in an ice bath. A total of 4 ml of toluene were introduced to the cooled mixtures, and vigorous vortexing was performed for 20 s. Finally, the supernatant was analyzed spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 520 nanometers, with the proline content being quantified and expressed as micromoles per gram of fresh weight using the methodology established by.The phenol and sulfuric acid methods were used to measure soluble sugar content. A total of 0.5 g of fresh leaves were homogenized with ethanol and mixed with 98% sulfuric acid and 5% phenol. This mixture was left for one hour, and its absorption was measured by a spectrophotometer at 485 nm.Analysis of variance for the results was performed using the generalized linear model (GLM) model SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) software and the effects of irrigation regimes, the application of biofertilizers and the interactions between these two variables were evaluated by ANOVA. Means were compared using Duncan’s multiple range test, and differences between individual means were considered significant at p < 0.05. The graphs were drawn in Excel.","The experimental factors’ interaction was significant regarding plant height, leaf count, chlorophyll a and b concentrations, total soluble solids (TSS), and proline content. Additionally, the main effect of irrigation and biofertilizer emerged as significant on parameters such as dry yield, essential oil (EO) content, EO yield, carotenoid content, and relative water content (RWC).The tallest plants, measuring 65 cm, were observed under optimal irrigation conditions (WW) when both AMF and PGPR were applied simultaneously. Nonetheless, no noteworthy contrast in plant height was observed with the discrete application of these two biofertilizers. Conversely, the most diminutive plants, standing at 37 cm, were observed in severe water stress (SWS), devoid of any biofertilizer application.Relative to well-watered conditions (WW), the plant height experienced reductions of 11.8% and 26.9% under moderate water stress (MWS) and severe water stress (SWS), respectively. Furthermore, the introduction of AMF, PGPR, and the combination of AMF + PGPR yielded enhancements in plant height by 17.3%, 11.4%, and 28.9%, respectively, when contrasted against the control group (Fig. 2).Simultaneous co-inoculation with both AMF and PGPR, alongside the well-watered (WW) treatment, exhibited a significant augmentation in the leaf count compared to the control group. The most minimal leaf count was registered within the SWS, wherein no biofertilizers were administered. Notably, leaf count exhibited 11.5% and 31.1% reductions under moderate water stress (MWS) and severe water stress (SWS), respectively. Conversely, the introduction of AMF, PGPR, or the combined application of AMF + PGPR led to increments of 17%, 8.5%, and 23.3%, respectively, in the number of leaves compared to the control group (Fig. 3).The highest dry yield (DY) of 11.53 grams per plant was observed under well-watered (WW) conditions, whereas the lowest DY of 8.71 grams per plant was documented in severe water stress (SWS) conditions. The DY exhibited 10.2% and 24.5% reductions under moderate water stress (MWS) and severe water stress (SWS), respectively.The findings unveiled that the introduction of AMF, PGPR, or the combined application of AMF + PGPR could foster an elevation in DY by 23.7%, 13.5%, and 37.3%, respectively, compared to the control group (Table 1).The maximum essential oil (EO) content, measuring 1.29%, was observed within the MWS treatment, while the lowest content of 1.01% was recorded in the WW treatment. Notably, the EO productivity of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. exhibited an increase of 27.7% and 13.9% in conditions characterized by MWS and SWS, respectively. Furthermore, the concurrent inoculation of AMF and PGPR markedly amplified the EO content of D. kotschyi Boiss. This enhancement was 27.2% compared to situations where biofertilizers were not applied (Table 2).The highest essential oil (EO) yield, measuring 0.13 grams per plant, was achieved under conditions of MWS, while the lowest yield of 0.10 grams per plant was observed in SWS treatments. Additionally, the most substantial EO yield was documented when the co-inoculation of AMF and PGPR was implemented, resulting in a noteworthy increase of 66.7% compared to the control treatment (Table 2).The highest concentrations of chlorophyll a (0.59 mg g−1 fresh weight) and chlorophyll b (0.24 mg g−1 fresh weight) were observed in plants subjected to WW conditions and co-inoculated with both AMF and PGPR. Compared to the well-watered conditions, the chlorophyll a and b contents experienced 12.7% and 13.6% under MWS and reductions of 21.8% and 22.7% under SWS treatments. Remarkably, the co-inoculation of AMF and PGPR yielded a substantial enhancement in chlorophyll a and b content, increasing by 32.5% and 31.2%, respectively (Figs. 4A and 4B).The most elevated carotenoid concentration (2.22 mg g−1 fresh weight) was derived from plants subjected to MWS, closely trailed by those under SWS, with concentrations 15.6% and 9.4% higher than WW conditions, respectively. Moreover, the introduction of AMF, PGPR, and their combined application (AMF + PGPR) all contributed to enhancements in carotenoid concentration, specifically by 4.6%, 2.5%, and 13.6%, respectively (Table 3).The maximum relative water content (RWC), measuring 88.73%, was observed in WW conditions, while the lowest content of 72.48% was recorded under SWS. The RWC exhibited a downward trend in conjunction with diminishing soil water availability. Compared to WW treatment, the RWC content saw 10.7% and 18.3% reductions in the presence of MWS and SWS, respectively. Remarkably, the co-inoculation of AMF and PGPR resulted in the highest RWC value, surpassing the control treatment by 15.5% (Table 3).The simultaneous application of AMF and PGPR and treatment of SWS exhibited a marked increase in total soluble solids (TSS) content. Notably, the TSS content demonstrated an upward trajectory as soil water availability diminished. Compared to treatment WW, the TSS content experienced 32.8% and 68.5% increments under MWS and SWS conditions, respectively. Intriguingly, the inoculation with AMF, PGPR, and the combined application of AMF + PGPR led to enhancements in TSS content by 20.2%, 17.2%, and 38.1%, respectively (Fig. 5).The simultaneous application of AMF and PGPR, coupled with the SWS treatment, yielded the highest proline content (18.5 µmol g−1 fresh weight). The proline content exhibited an ascending trend as soil water availability decreased. Compared to WW conditions, the proline content demonstrated 16.6% and 33.1% increments under MWS and SWS treatments, respectively.Furthermore, the introduction of AMF, PGPR, and the combined application of AMF + PGPR led to enhancements in proline content by 13.1%, 4.7%, and 26.5%, respectively (Fig. 6).Applying GC-MS and GC-FID analysis, 26 compounds were successfully identified within the essential oil (EO) of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. Among these, the predominant constituents were geranyl acetate (11.4–18.88%), alpha-pinene (9.33–15.08%), Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (8.43–12.8%), neral (6.80–9.32%), geranial (9.23–11.91%), and limonene (5.56–9.12%). Remarkably, the highest levels of geranyl acetate, geranial, limonene, and alpha-pinene were observed within the context of MWS, particularly following the co-application of AMF and PGPR. Similarly, the maximum content of Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate and neral was documented under SWS, specifically when the co-inoculation of AMF and PGPR was implemented (Table 4).","The study’s findings revealed a noticeable decline in yield and associated components because of the water deficit treatments: moderate water stress (MWS) and severe water stress (SWS). In situations of moderate water limitation, the reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption and photosynthesis rate can be attributed to the stomatal closure mechanism, which serves to curtail water transpiration and, subsequently, the production of plant biomass. Under conditions of severe water scarcity, the decrement in plant yield can be attributed to disruptions in chloroplast structure coupled with diminished cell division and elongation. This cascade of effects leads to compromised leaf development and expansion, diminishing light interception and photosynthesis rate.Furthermore, the study’s results align with observations made by, who noted that applying biofertilizers enhanced the growth and dry weight of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. Incorporating biofertilizers was also found to bolster the plant’s resilience against water scarcity, diseases, and pests.The co-application of AMF and PGPR emerges as the most efficacious treatment, yielding the highest agronomic traits and dry yield. The introduction of AMF contributes to enhanced nutrient and water absorption, thereby improving primary plant metabolism and elevating both photosynthesis rate and overall performance. Similarly, the application of PGPR induces a stimulatory effect on plant growth, primarily by augmenting the rate of nitrogen fixation, enhancing nutrient solubility—particularly for phosphorus (P) and potassium(K)—promoting siderophore production, and facilitating the synthesis of enzymes that regulate ethylene production. In another research, it was found that the presence of suitable conditions for the growth of D. moldavica plants, including increasing the availability of necessary nutrients, especially nitrogen, under the influence of co-application AMF with PGPR under water deficit stress, through improving growth, development, and photosynthesis, leads to an improvement in plant height, and leaves number, which ultimately leads to an increase in the yield of dry weight. Inoculated plants also improved stomatal regulation through hormonal adjustment. Production of IAA by symbiotic bacteria may partly explain their effectiveness in promoting plant growth under adverse environmental conditions. It has been reported that the inoculation of biofertilizers enhances growth parameters and aerial dry weight in D. kotschyi Boiss. under water deficit stress. reported that applying biofertilizer improved the biological and grain yields of dragon head plants compared to those not subjected to fertilization under water stress. reported that AMF and PGPR applications improved plant development and production of dragon head plants under water shortage stress states by increasing nutrient accessibility and absorption. The authors attributed such results to the positive effect exerted by the treatments on vegetative growth, chlorophyll synthesis, and photosynthesis capacity, especially under water shortage tension. The beneficial influence of AMF and PGPR may be related to increased soil organic matter content and a regulated availability of nutrients in the agricultural soil, which directly influence dragon head plant photosynthetic and vegetative growth.The application of both AMF and PGPR, denoted as treatment MWS, led to an enhancement in essential oil (EO) biosynthesis, EO yield, and the major constituents of the EO, namely geranyl acetate, geranial, limonene, and alpha-pinene. This augmentation in EO production under stressful conditions underscores the plant’s adaptive physiological responses to challenging environments.In situations characterized by water limitation, the photosynthesis rate tends to decrease due to the closure of stomata, which in turn reduces the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2). This leads to the accumulation of NADPH and H+ ions within cells. In response, the biosynthesis of EO compounds is activated as an alternative pathway, specifically through methyleritrophosphate and mevalonic acid pathways, which consume excess NADPH and H+ ions. Similar phenomena have been documented in other plant species; for example, the essential oil yield and major EO compounds of Rosmarinus officinalis L. were reported to be increased under moderate drought stress conditions. The elevation in the biosynthesis of EO constituents resulting from the combined application of AMF and PGPR can be attributed to their role in enhancing nutrient accessibility. This enhancement subsequently facilitates the development of glandular trichomes and the formation of EO intermediate compounds such as ATP and acetyl coenzyme A. reported that applying biological fertilizers improved the oil content and oil yield of the dragon head plants under water shortage stress. Also, such treatments may enhance the extent of essential oil-producing glands in flowers and leaves of the dragon head plant under water shortage stress. In the current investigation, biofertilizers such as AMF and PGPR may have enhanced the nutrient uptake and improved plant moisture relationships compared to control plants, leading to the essential oil and essential oil yield of the dragon head plants increment.Chlorophyll content exhibited a pronounced decline in response to increased water availability, primarily attributable to the occurrence of membrane lipid peroxidation and the decomposition of chlorophyll due to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Observations in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seedlings have similarly indicated reduced chlorophyll a and b content under drought stress conditions. Conversely, the carotenoid content demonstrated enhancement following both MWS and SWS treatments. This phenomenon can be attributed to the operation of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems, which effectively counteract oxidative damage in plant tissues subjected to water limitation. Among the non-enzymatic antioxidants, carotenoids (including xanthophylls and carotenes), along with ascorbates and alpha-tocopherol, play a vital role in bolstering plant tolerance against stress by attenuating the activity of ROS compounds. The increased carotenoid concentration observed in response to water deficit stress conditions reinforces plant defence mechanisms to cope with stress-induced challenges. reported that by enhancing the water shortage stress in the dragon head, chlorophyll a, b, chlorophyll a + b, and carotenoids at flowering stages were decreased; nevertheless, they were improved in response to AMF and PGPR. The degradation of such pigments or the reduction of their synthesis, associated with the reduced activity of enzymes involved in their synthesis, causes chlorophyll decline in dragon head plants exposed to water deficit stress, resulting in reduced assimilation material and, thus, performance losses.The relative water content (RWC) exhibited a reduction concomitant with the diminishing availability of soil water. This decline in RWC in response to water deficit stress conditions arises from an escalation in leaf transpiration rate coupled with a decrease in the rate of water absorption by the roots. Notably, the integrated application of AMF and PGPR contributed to an enhancement in RWC. The mechanism behind this enhancement is closely linked to the penetration of fungal hyphae into the root cortex and endoderm, which augments the hydraulic conductivity of water by establishing a path characterized by low resistance across the root cells. This phenomenon has been noted in prior research, where the inoculation of Dorema moldavica L. roots with AMF enhanced RWC under water deficit stress conditions. reported that the leaf RWC of the dragon head diminishes as water stress increases. The decrease of tissues’ turgor in plant and leaf RWC can be the first effect of water deficit stress, which can have a natural influence on the development, growth, and ultimate size of cells.AMF and PGPR fertilizers enhance water uptake in the host plant by altering root architecture and spreading the plant’s root system. Indeed, biofertilizers can alleviate the negative influences of water deficit stress on dragon head plants by enhancing leaf moisture potential, transpiration rate, photosynthetic efficiency, and rate of CO2 use. Moreover, they can promote the absorption of nutrients, enhancing growth and plant production. In the present study, an augmentation in proline and total soluble solids(TSS) content was observed under drought-stress conditions following the application of AMF and PGPR. These concentrations of TSS substances allow growth in low water conditions. The most important source of TSS substances is photosynthetic compounds, which are either produced directly or from the hydrolysis of carbon reserves. Since both photosynthesis and growth are affected by drought stress, their balance affects the accumulation of TSS substances. Considering that a water shortage affects growth before photosynthesis is affected, the accumulation of photosynthesis products seems obvious. Therefore sucrose acts as a signaling molecule in low concentrations and as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species in high concentrations. Thus the buildup of TSS inside the cells performs a necessary part in the regulation of osmosis and permits the reduction of the water potential of the cell, so more water remains inside the cell to maintain turgor under drought stress.In drought stress conditions, osmotic regulators can escalate the power of water uptake by plant cells. The accumulation of this osmotic regulator can be related to drought resistance. The improved vegetative growth could account for the higher TSS in applying AMF and PGPR-treated plants of dragon heads. The application of AMF and PGPR probably enhanced growth and led to a greater concentration of carbohydrates under drought stress. This elevation in the levels of osmolytes like proline and TSS is recognized as a vital adaptive response of plants to counteract the impact of drought and other stressful circumstances. The accumulation of these compounds during stressful conditions plays a crucial role in preserving leaf cell turgidity, safeguarding cell membranes, preventing protein denaturation, and neutralizing free radicals. The increase in TSS in the application of AMF and PGPR, which affects the osmotic potential, helps to maintain the health and function of the cell membranes of the dragon head that have been damaged by water stress.Reinforcing this observation, it has been documented that the proline content in Lallemantia iberica plants increased notably under moderate and severe drought stress. Additionally, the increased concentration of osmolytes within plant cells under water-limiting conditions serves to lower the osmotic potential, thereby enhancing the plant’s capacity to absorb water from the soil via the roots, consequently boosting its resilience in such situations. Moreover, the enhanced proline content resulting from the integrated application of AMF + PGPR can be attributed to the intertwined relationship between proline concentration in plant cells and nitrogen availability. The accessibility of nutrients, especially nitrogen, is facilitated by the role of these fertilizers. Additionally, it has been reported that the symbiotic association between AMF and plant roots under drought stress conditions promotes an increase in proline content through the upregulation of the glutamate pathway and downregulation of proline degradation. This interplay between plant and AMF has been evident in sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas L.), where AMF inoculation led to increased tolerance to water deficit by elevating proline content and soluble sugars. Dragon head plants inoculated with biofertilizers such as AMF + PGPR can usually manage nutrients and water more suitably than non-treated crops under moisture shortage stress situations. Therefore, the proline content, such as dragon head plants, indicates a lower upsurge compared to non-treated plants.","The study reveals the detrimental impact of water stress on the agronomic traits and dry matter yield of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. plant. However, in the face of water stress conditions, the concurrent application of AMF and PGPR emerges as a strategy that effectively mitigates these adverse effects. This integrated approach showcases its potential to enhance various parameters, including chlorophylls, carotenoids, proline, and total soluble sugars. Furthermore, the co-application of AMF + PGPR positively influences the dry matter yield and essential oil yield of D. kotschyi Boiss. plants, marking a significant achievement in pursuit of the primary cultivation goal.The synergistic effect of AMF and PGPR is observed in the elevation of essential oil content and the pivotal compounds within the essential oil, notably geranyl acetate, geranial, limonene, and alpha-pinene. This promising outcome holds substantial implications for enhancing grain and essential oil yields while concurrently addressing environmental concerns linked to the excessive usage of chemical fertilizers. Moreover, the cultivation of D. kotschyi Boiss., known for its low water requirements, presents an avenue for prudent water management and increased plant tolerance. In light of these findings, the co-application of AMF and PGPR in water stress conditions emerges as a viable strategy to achieve the dual objectives of augmenting plant productivity and essential oil yield while concurrently advancing sustainable agriculture principles.In contrast to earlier investigations into Dracocephalum kotschyi, this study has made a substantial contribution to our comprehension of how the combined application of AMF and PGPR can improve the plant’s growth and biochemical characteristics when subjected to water scarcity. Notably, this study has shed light on the mechanisms behind the observed improvements. The choice of AMF and PGPR species does matter, as the co-application of certain strains yielded the most promising results. However, there is a need for further exploration and identification of the most effective strains for Dracocephalum kotschyi.The next step in this research area should involve a more comprehensive investigation into the specific AMF and PGPR strains that can maximize the plant’s resilience to water scarcity. Additionally, understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying the observed improvements in growth and biochemical attributes would be valuable. This knowledge gap presents an exciting opportunity for future research, which could lead to the development of tailored strategies for enhancing the growth of Dracocephalum kotschyi under water deficit conditions. Furthermore, while this study has shown improvements in yield, essential oil production, and physiological responses, more extensive field trials and long-term assessments are necessary to confirm the practical applicability of these findings in real-world agricultural settings."
34,TA038173,10.3390/molecules13061333,Characterization of aroma active compounds in fruit juice and peel oil of Jinchensweet orange fruit (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) by GC-MS and GC-O.,"Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-olfactometry(GC-O) were used to determine the aromatic composition and aroma active compoundsof fruit juice and peel oil of Jinchen sweet orange fruit. Totals of 49 and 32compounds were identified in fruit juice and peel oil, respectively. GC-O wasperformed to study the aromatic profile of Jinchen fruit juice and peel oil. Atotal of 41 components appeared to contribute to the aroma of fruit juice andpeel oil. Twelve components were the odorants perceived in both samples. Thearomatic compositions of fruit juice were more complex than that of peel oil.Ethyl butanoate, beta-myrcene, octanal, linalool, alpha-pinene, and decanal werefound to be responsible for the aromatic notes in fruit juice and peel oil.Nineteen components have been perceived only in the juice and ten compounds weredescribed as aromatic components of only the peel oil by the panelists. Thesedifferences lead to the different overall aroma between fruit juice and peel oil.","Qiao, Yu, Xie, Bi Jun, Zhang, Yan, Zhang, Yun, Fan, Gang, Yao, Xiao Lin, Pan, Si Yi",2008,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"Orange fruits are the most popular ones for consumers throughout the world due to their pleasant flavors and nutritional value. The fruits are both consumed fresh and industrially processed. The pulps, which are rich in soluble sugars, significant amounts of vitamin C, pectin, fiber and different organic acids, are mainly used to process into juice. Orange peels containing abundant fragrant substances are extensively applied for processing into essential oils which are used commercially for flavoring foods, beverages, perfumes, cosmetics, etc.Analytical research on the aroma compounds in orange fruit has been carried out for many years. Many researchers have studied the volatile compounds of this fruit using different analytical methods. As a result of these studies, more than 200 components have been described as components of the flavor of sweet orange, and the major aroma compounds found in orange juice are hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and ketones. The presences of terpenes with traces of oxygenated components are the aromatic character in the orange essential oil and peel oil.Only a small part of all volatiles present in food has a primary impact on aroma. The aromatic quality of the fruit is primarily dependent on the aroma active compounds. Gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) analysis is a valuable method for the detection of aroma active compounds from a food matrix. The three main GC-O methods are the dilution analysis, detection frequency and perceived intensity method, and these techniques have been employed by various researchers to determine the aroma impacting compounds in orange juice. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is a rapid, solvent-free, low-cost, simple extracting method, and usually combined with GC-O analysis. The amounts of flavor compounds absorbed on the SPME coating were greatly influenced by the diffusion of flavor components through orange juice into the headspace and the headspace gas reach to the SPME coating. Therefore, the high correlations between the concentrations and GC peak area were not obtained for all the volatile compounds. It is also difficult to perform the dilution analysis such as AEDA using SPME extracts. Kim et al. varied the GC injector split ratio to achieve dilution stepwise of the flavor compounds in HS-SPME–GC-O using an aqueous model system and yuzu tea. The research only demonstrated that serial dilution of the four flavor compounds in yuzu can be achieved successful through the increase of GC split ratio, other aroma compounds was not be mentioned. Some researchers conducted the intensity method or frequency method combined with SPME to analysis orange juice flavor. Bazeome et al. stated that ethyl butanoate, mycrene, trans-2-nonenal, decanal, octanal, terpinen-4-ol, cis-hex-3-enal and three unkown compounds were aroma active compounds in unpasteurized juice and heated juice, using SPME extraction and intensity method. Arena et al. used frequency detection method and SPME to find twenty-two odor active compounds in hand-squeezed juices of Moro, Tarocco, Washington navel and Valencia late oranges.GC–O procedure has also been conducted to characterize the aroma active components in some citrus essential oils. Lin and Rouseff detected 38 aroma-active compounds in commercial cold-pressed grapefruit oil using a time–intensity GC-O procedure and concluded that the greatest aroma intensity compounds were1, 8-cineole, octanal, dodecanal, trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal, β-sinensal and nootkatone. Högnadóttir and Rouseff found 55 aroma active compounds of the detected 95 volatile compounds in orange essence oil. The flavor compounds in orange peel oil extracted by SPME have never been reported.Jinchen is a native sweet crop of Citrus Sinensis. It originated from the Sichuan province and has been widely planted in the middle and upper regions of the Yangtze River. No research on Jinchen aroma has ever been reported, though Jinchen is of economic importance to the citrus industry in China. The aim of the study was to determine the aroma active compounds in Jinchen orange fruit juice and peel oil by GC-MS and GC-O, as well as to provide useful information about the most important potent odorants in this fruit.","Unpasteurized Jinchen orange fruit juice and peel oil were obtained from a local manufacturer of citrus products located at Songzi in Hubei province. Both the juice and the peel oil were derived from the same fruit source. The fruit juice was processed with a Polycitrus juice extractor. The peel oil was obtained from cold-pressed peel of the Jinchen orange fruit. The juice and oil samples were stored at ‑20 °C until analyzed.The manual SPME device equipped with a 50/30 μm DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber (Supelco, Bellfonte, PA, USA) was used for extraction volatile compounds of fruit juice. The fiber was conditioned in the GC injector port at 270 °C for 1 h prior to use. The orange juice (5 mL) and peel oil (5 mL) were placed into a 20 mL vial containing a micro stirring bar, respectively. The sample was equilibrated at 40 °C±1 °C for 15 min and headspace extracted by DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber for 40 min at the same temperature under stirring (500 rpm). After extraction, the fiber was inserted into the injection port of the GC to desorb the analytes for 5 min. Each analytical sample was measured in triplicate. The results are reported as the mean values of relative peak area percent ± SD (standard deviation)Authentic standards were obtained as follows: α-pinene were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Germany) n-alkanes (C8-C20), ethyl butyrate, β-myrcene, linalool, decanal, were obtained from FluKa Chemical Co. (Germany). Hexanal, trans-2-hexenal, benzaldehyde, octanal, limonene, nonanal, α-terpineol, neral, geranial, neryl acetate, geranyl acetate, citronellyl acetate and valencene were gifts from the GLD-Boton Essential Company (P. R. China).GC-MS was carried out using a HP 5975B quadropole mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, USA). The Mass spectral ionization temperature was set at 230 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact ionization mode at a voltage of 70 eV. Mass spectra were taken over the m/z range 30–400.The flow rate of the helium carrier gas on HP-5 column (30 m×0.25 mmI.D, 0.25 μm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) was 1 mL/min. The analysis performed in the splitless mode and injector temperature was 250 °C. The column was held at 40 °C for 3 min, and then increased from 40 °C to 160 °C at 3 °C/min, held at 160 °C for 2 min, and finally increased to 220 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, then held for 3 min.Volatile components were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the mass spectra from MS libraries (NIST 05, WILEY 7.0). When available, MS identifications were confirmed by comparing GC retention times of the analytes with those from pure standards. The identification was confirmed using retention indices (RI), and the value was compared with those reported in the literature. Linear retention indices (RI) of the compounds were calculated using a series of n-alkanes (C8–C20, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) injected in the same conditions. When standard chemicals were not available, tentative identification was carried out by matching the mass spectra. The results are given in Table 1.The analysis was carried out using a HP 6890 GC equipped with a HP-5 column (30 m×0.25 mm I.D, 0.25 μm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) directly connected to a HP 5975 series mass selective detector and a sniffing port (ODP2, Gerstel,Inc., Baltimore, MD). The GC effluent was split 1/2 between the mass spectrometer and the sniffing port. The transfer line to the GC-O sniffing port was held at 280 °C. The volume of sample extract analyzed and oven program temperatures were the same as those described above for the GC-MS. Humidified air was added in the sniffing port at 60 mL/min. Compound identifications were made by comparison of the mass spectra, retention times, and the RI of the volatile components in both extracts with those of corresponding reference standards. The mass spectrometer retention times were compared with the retention times measured in the olfactometry runs, and both were compared to reference standards.Three panelists were used for the intensity detection and verbal description of the odor active components identified in both extracts by GC-O. The first training was familiarization with the scale and the system in a short period. During this period the panelists performed three times analysis of one of the test samples and rate intensity of the eluted odor using the four scale (1=extremely weak, 2=clear but not intense odor, 3=intense odor, 4=extremely strong). They were not instructed about what was the expected intensity of the odors and each one used the intensity category, which in his / her opinion fitted best the intensity of the odor perception caused by the eluted odorant. Test data were recorded only after panelists demonstrated an ability to replicate analyses and the scales given by each panelist were not significant difference. After the successful test, the trained panelists carried out sniffing the samples and recorded the perceived intensities of the odor.The results of intensity from two samples were statistically evaluated by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistically, differences with P-values under 0.05 were considered significant","In the analysis of volatile components present in Jinchen fruit juice, a total of 49 compounds were identified including 20 hydrocarbons, 10 aldehydes, nine esters, nine alcohols, and one ketone (Table 1). Limonene, followed by linalool, terpinen-4-ol, β-myrcene, α-terpineol, octanal, and γ-terpinene were the components found in greatest proportions.In peel oil extracts, a total of 32 compounds were identified in the volatile fraction, including 16 hydrocarbons and eight aldehydes, three esters, three alcohols, one ketone and one terpenic oxide(Table 1). Among these components, limonene was the one found in greatest concentrations, representing 90.85% of all volatiles. Other predominant components were β-myrcene, γ-terpinene, linalool and α-pinene.In both samples the major compounds were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The peel oil contained terpenes at higher levels than those of the fruit juice, except for cis-β-ocimene, β-myrcene, terpinolene, δ-amorphene and valencene. Three sesquiterpenes which could not be found in peel oil were detected in small quantity in fruit juice: α-cubebene, β-elemene, and α-caryophyllene. Bicyclogermacrene, which had been reported in lime oils by Tu et al. and Ferhat et al. was found in Jinchen peel oil in minor amounts (0.01%), but was not found in Jinchen fruit juice.It is interesting to note the large difference between the numbers of alcohols and esters found in the fruit juice and peel oil. Six alcohols only found in the fruit juice were 1-octanol, β-terpineol, terpinen-4-ol, nerol, trans-carveol, and geraniol. These have been mentioned as important compounds associated to the pulp in the juice. Another possible reason for their presence is that the alcohols are reaction products generated during the processing or storage of the orange juice. Terpinen-4-ol is the degradation product of D-limonene and linalool during the heat treatment of juice and its concentration significantly increased during the storage of the heat-treated juices.Esters have been described to be most important to orange flavor. Ethyl butanoate followed by ethyl acetate, ethyl propanoate, and methyl butanoate, only present in fruit juice, were not detected in peel oil. These lower boiling points and high volatility esters could have higher degree of affinity in the pulp. Aldehyde content, especially of octanal and decanal, is generally considered one of the standards for characterization for orange peel oil,. These compounds were the most predominant among the aldehyde compounds in both samples, occurring in higher proportions in fruit juice than in peel oil. In addition, other aliphatic aldehydes play an important role in orange flavor. Nonanal, and dodecanal were only present in peel oil, whereas hexanal, trans-2-hexenal, heptanal, undecanal were only detected in fruit juice. A terpenic aldehyde only present in the peel oil was citronellal, constituting 0.06% of all volatile compounds, which has been reported in many citrus oils. The aldehydes are most likely enzymatic degradation products of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.With respect to the rest of the identified components, nootkatone was found in both fruit juice and peel oil. It is a typical component of grapefruits, and its content in the fruits increases with maturation and storage. One terpenic oxide compound (trans-limonene oxide) was identified only in the peel oil of Jinchen fruit. It is possible that the limonene oxidation during the process and storage may be responsible for the formation of this compound in peel oil.It was cosidered very necessary to determine the components responsible for the quality of the aroma of Jinchen fruit, therefore, GC-O was performed for further studying the aromatic profile of Jinchen fruit juice and peel oil.The odor descriptors for all volatile components perceived by panelists in fruit juice and peel oil extracts of Jinchen fruit are shown in Table 2. As a result of the different odor thresholds of each component, not all of the compounds quantified contribute to the aroma in the juice and peel oil. However, olfactometric analysis utilizes the highly selective detector (human nose) that can detect potent low-level aroma-active compounds which could not be quantified by GC-MS (trans-2-hexen-1-ol, ethyl 3-hydroxyhexanoate, and six unknown compounds).A total of 31 components appeared to contribute to the aromatic profile in Jinchen fruit juice. Among them, ethyl butanoate, β-myrcene, octanal, linalool, and decanal decided the juice aroma because they are the strongest aroma active compounds perceived by all the panelists. Regarding the peel oil, 22 components appeared to contribute to the overall aroma. Linalool, α-pinene, and decanal defined the aroma of the oil, because these compounds had the greatest aroma intensity. Twelve compounds were perceived by all the panelists in both juice and oil. Among them, five aromatic compounds present different odor intensity in both samples, such as α-pinene, β-myrcene, octanal, (trans, trans)-2,4-decadienal, and valencene. The intensity of octanal, trans, trans-2, 4- decadienal, and valencene showed the significant difference (P<0.05) between the fruit juice and peel oil. Especially, valencene exhibited higher intensity in Jinchen fruit juice than in the peel oil, though valencene was not generally considered an important contributor to orange juice flavor in previously reports.The different overall aroma between fruit juice and peel oil are attributed to the various composition of aroma active compounds. The components which were perceived by all the panelists and only detected in the fruit juice or peel oil respectively may contribute to the aromatic differences. Among these, 19 components have been perceived only in the juice and 10 compounds were described as aromatic components of only the peel oil by the three panelists. Nineteen volatile components detected by the panelists only in fruit juice contribute to citrusy, green, and piney notes. The other ten volatile components described as aromatic components of only the peel oil impart a camphor, minty, green, fruity, and floral aroma.According to these results, not all of the components found in greatest concentration by GC-MS contributed to the aroma in orange juice. Limonene was present in highest amount versus other volatiles, but did not exhibit strongest aroma activity though it has orange odor in GC-O of fruit juice and peel oil. In contrast, ethyl 3-hydroxyhexanoate and nerol were not detected by GC-MS and found in low concentration, contributing to citrusy and lemon aroma of the fruit juice according to GC-O intensity data.Most odorant compounds characterized in Jinchen orange juice were also detected in some sweet orange juice, such as ethyl butyrate, myrcene, octanal, decanal, terpinen-4-ol, linalool, limonene, α-pinene, and hexanal, but nonanal and (E)-2-nonenal was not found to be major aroma active compound in Jinchen juice. There were also some aroma active compounds detected in Jinchen juice not commonly reported in other orange juices, such as ethyl 3-hydroxyhexanoate, perillaldehyde, thymol, trans,trans-2,4-decadienal, δ-amorphene. The aroma activities of these compounds in sweet orange flavor are not well documented. Most volatile compounds detected in Jinchen peel-oil were also found in many citrus oils, such as limonene, α-pinene, myrcene, octanal, decanal, terpinen-4-ol, linalool, γ-terpinene, terpiolene, citronellal, neral, α-copaene, valencene and nootkatone. These compounds were previously reported in other citrus oils but their aroma activities and contribution to citrus oil flavor were not described. δ-Amorphene was the only compound found and identified tentatively in Jinchen peel-oil not previously reported in other citrus essential oils.",,"In conclusion, in this study of the aromatic composition of fruit juice and peel oil of Jinchen orange a total of 57 components identified. GC-O was used to detect the aroma active compounds. There are 31 aromatic compounds present in the fruit juice, and 22 components appear to be the major contributors to the peel oil aroma, respectively. Twelve compounds were perceived by all panelists in juice and peel samples. Five compounds not identified by GC-MS were characterized in both samples. For fruit juice, ethyl butanoate, β-myrcene, octanal, linalool, and decanal had greatest aroma intensity. Linalool, α-pinene, and decanal presented highest aroma intensity in peel oil. Nineteen components have been perceived only in the juice sample, and ten compounds were described as aromatic components of only the peel oil by the panelists. These differences probably lead to the different overall aroma between fruit juice and peel oil. The aromatic composition in the fruit juice was more complex than that of the peel oil."
35,TA046933,10.1590/S1678-9946202062097,Anti-Zika virus activity of several abietane-type ferruginol analogues.,"Abietane diterpenoids are naturally occurring plant metabolites with a broadspectrum of biological effects including antibacterial, antileishmanial,antitumor, antioxidant, as well as antiinflammatory activities. Recently, wefound that some analogues of natural ferruginol ( 2 ) actively inhibited denguevirus 2 (DENV-2) replication. Due to the similarity with DENV, we envisaged thatabietane diterpenoids would also be active against Zika virus (ZIKV). Sixselected semi-synthetic abietane derivatives of (+)-dehydroabietylamine ( 3 )were tested. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay in Vero cells. In vitroanti-ZIKV (clinical isolate, IMT17) activity was evaluated by plaque assay.Interestingly, these molecules showed potential as anti-ZIKV agents, with EC50values ranging from 0.67 to 18.57 µM, and cytotoxicity (CC50 values) from 2.56 to35.09 µM. The 18-Oxoferruginol (8) (EC50 = 2.60 µM, SI = 13.51) and12-nitro-N-benzoyldehydroabietylamine (9) (EC50= 0.67 µM, SI = 3.82) were themost active compounds, followed by 12-hydroxy-N-tosyldehydroabietylamine ( 7 )(EC50 = 3.58 µM, SI = 3.20) and 12-hydroxy-N,N-phthaloyldehydroabietylamine ( 5 )(EC50 = 7.76 µM, SI = 1.23). To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstreport on anti-Zika virus properties of abietanes.","Sousa, Francielle T G, Nunes, Cristina, Romano, Camila Malta, Sabino, Ester Cerdeira, González-Cardenete, Miguel Angel",2020,Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo,2,False,False,True,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family, phylogenetically close to dengue virus and yellow fever. Zika virus is mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and usually causes a mild dengue-like illness that may include fever, cutaneous rash, malaise, headache, muscle and joint pain, and/or swollen lymph nodes. Neurological complications include Guillain–Barré syndrome and congenital malformations leading to microcephaly . Although Zika virus outbreaks have declined after 2017, autochthonous transmission of ZIKV still occurs globally across at least 87 countries and territories, with the potential for re-emergence . Since specific antiviral drugs or vaccines are not available, there is urgency in identifying antiviral agents, particularly new molecular scaffolds with potential novel mechanisms of actions.Natural products have played a dominant role in the drug discovery efforts for the treatment of human diseases . In fact, in 2015, small molecules accounted for 45 drugs as antivirals other than synthetic molecules or 70% overall based on natural products, indicating the potential of identifying new therapeutic candidates from natural sources . The abietane diterpenoids are widely produced by conifers and plants belonging to the families Araucariaceae, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae, and angiosperm species . These natural products have a wide range of biological activities . For example, dehydroabietic acid ( 1 , DHA) ( Figure 1 ), displays not only antiulcer and antimicrobial properties, but also antitumor effects. Ferruginol ( 2 ) ( Figure 1 ) was first isolated in 1939 and has been extensively studied because of intriguing chemical framework and promising biological properties . Ferruginol ( 2 ) occurs in plants belonging to the Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Lamiaceae and Verbenaceae families among others. This diterpene exhibited important bioactivities, such as antifungal and antimicrobial, miticidal, cardioactive, antioxidative, antileishmanial and nematicidal, antiulcer, and anti-SARS properties  . In addition, there are several reports on antimalarial activity of ferruginol ( 2 ) . Recently, it has been reported that several antimalarials are endowed with anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV activities . We have also found that some analogues derived from (+)-dehydroabietylamine ( 3 ) ( Figure 1 ) of the naturally occurring abietane ferruginol ( 2 ) ( Figure 1 ) were active against DENV-2 . The 12-hydroxyabieta-8,11,13-triene skeleton, which is characteristic of the diterpenoid ferruginol ( 2 ), is therefore an interesting molecular scaffold for the development of novel antivirals against flaviviruses.To explore the potential of some selected analogues of ferruginol ( 2 ) as antiviral candidates, and in continuation of our research programs to discover bioactive terpenoids, herein we report the evaluation of previously synthesized semisynthetic derivatives 4 – 9    from the commercially available (+)-dehydroabietylamine ( 3 ) ( Figure 1 ) against a Brazilian strain of ZIKV.The compounds were obtained in enantiomerically pure form from commercially available (+)-dehydroabietylamine ( 3 ) ( Figure 1 ) according to our previously reported synthetic procedures   . The generated analogues are named as follows: 12-hydroxy-dehydroabietylamine (18-aminoferruginol, 4 ), 12-hydroxy-N,N-phthaloyldehydroabietylamine ( 5 ), 12-acetoxy-N,N-(tetrachlorophthaloyl)dehydroabietylamine ( 6 ), 12-hydroxy-N-tosyldehydroabietylamine ( 7 ), 18-oxoferruginol ( 8 ) and 12-nitro-N-benzoyldehydroabietylamine ( 9 ). Stock solutions of the tested compounds were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and maintained at –20 °C until use.The cytotoxicity of the ferruginol analogues 4 – 9 ( Figure 2 ) was assessed on Vero cells (African green monkey kidney) by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay . Vero cells suspensions (2.7 × 105 cells/mL) prepared in MEM (Minimal Essential Medium, Vitrocell) with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco, Sao Paulo, Brazil) were distributed in 96-well plates (100 μL/well) and incubated at 37 °C (5% CO2) for 24 h. Then, the culture medium was replaced by 200 μL of two-fold serial dilutions of the compounds or DMSO. Cellular controls were treated with the culture medium only. After treatments, plates were further incubated at 37 °C for 4 days. Subsequently, 15 μL of the MTT solution (5 mg/mL) were added per well, and the plates were incubated again for 4 h. The MTT solution was removed and 100 μL of DMSO were added to dissolve formazan crystals. Finally, the plates were shaken and absorbance was read at 540 nm. The viability percentage data for each tested concentration of the compounds were entered in the GraphPad Prism software (version 5.01, San Diego, California, USA) to calculate the CC50 values, the concentration of compound that causes a 50% reduction in cell viability, through regression analysis.Zika virus (clinical isolate, IMT17) stock was produced and titrated in Vero cells. The viral titer, 4.67 × 106 plaque forming units per milliliter (PFU/mL), was determined by plaque assay . The potential anti-ZIKV activity was evaluated by viral plaque reduction assay. Briefly, Vero cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were grown in 24-well plates for 24 h. After that, cells were infected with 100 PFU/well and incubated for 1 h in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were then washed with PBS (pH 7.0) and treated with different concentrations of each compound [diluted in 2 X MEM with 2% FBS and 50% high viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, Sigma)]. Ribavirin was used as the positive control. Medium only and DMSO were used as untreated and solvent controls, respectively. After 4 days of incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, supernatants were removed, and cells were fixed and stained with 50% crystal violet in 50% ethanol. Plaque numbers were used to calculate the inhibition percentage values in order to determine the EC50, the concentration of the compound that inhibits viral replication by 50%, through non-linear regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism. Compounds efficacy was determined by the selectivity index (SI = CC50 / EC50), the ratio between cytotoxicity and antiviral activity.Cytotoxicity and antiviral assay results of the compounds 4-9 are shown in Table 1 . The 12-Nitro-N-benzoyldehydroabietylamine ( 9 ) (EC50= 0.67 µM, SI = 3.82 and EC90= 0.89 ± 0.004 µM) and 18-oxoferruginol ( 8 ) (EC50 = 2.60 µM, SI = 13.51 and EC90 = 20.79 ± 3.75 µM) were the most active antiviral compounds, followed by 12-hydroxy-N-tosyldehydroabietylamine ( 7 ) (EC50 = 3.58 µM, SI= 3.20) and 12-hydroxy-N,N-phthaloyldehydroabietylamine ( 5 ) (EC50= 7.76 µM, SI = 1.23).Inhibitory values against Zika virus ranged from 0.67 to 18.57 µM, with cytotoxicity properties varying from 2.56 to 35.09 µM. All compounds presented EC50 values lower than the reference ribavirin (EC50= 98.53 µM), although ribavirin displayed a higher SI value (26.25). The resulting experimental data indicate that nitro derivative ( 9 ) displayed potent antiviral activity but possess a certain cytotoxicity. Compound 18-oxoferruginol ( 8 ) presented the most promising results with a higher selectivity index (SI = 13.51). According to Chattopadhyay et al . a SI of 10 or greater is indicative of a promising antiviral activity. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that abietane-derived compounds represent a novel scaffold for the development of anti-Zika virus agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on anti-ZIKV activity of abietane-type diterpenoids. These encouraging findings warrant synthetic endeavors to get structure-activity relationships, as well as further mechanism of action and target identification studies.",,,,
36,TA048121,10.3390/md17100550,"Asperienes A-D, Bioactive Sesquiterpenes from the Marine-Derived FungusAspergillus flavus.","Marine-derived fungi of the genera Aspergillus could produce novel compounds withsignificant bioactivities. Among these fungi, the strain Aspergillus flavus isnotorious for its mutagenic mycotoxins production. However, some minor componentswith certain toxicities from A. flavus have not been specifically surveyed andmight have potent biological activities. Our investigation of the marine-derivedfungus Aspergillus flavus CF13-11 cultured in solid medium led to the isolationof four C-6'/C-7' epimeric drimane sesquiterpene esters, asperienes A-D (1-4).Their absolute configurations were assigned by electronic circular dichroism(ECD) and Snatzke's methods. This is the first time that two pairs of C-6'/C-7'epimeric drimane sesquiterpene esters have successfully been separated. AperienesA-D (1-4) displayed potent bioactivities towards four cell lines with the IC(50)values ranging from 1.4 to 8.3 μM. Interestingly, compounds 1 and 4 exhibitedlower toxicities than 2 and 3 toward normal GES-1 cells, indicating morepotential for development as an antitumor agent in the future.","Liu, Yun-Feng, Yue, Yu-Fei, Feng, Li-Xi, Zhu, Hua-Jie, Cao, Fei",2019,Marine drugs,2,False,False,True,"Natural products from marine-derived fungi have been a topic of intensive research in drug discovery considering their pharmacological importance. Among these bioactive compounds, sesquiterpenes (including drimane sesquiterpenes, phenolic bisabolane sesquiterpenes, eremophilane sesquiterpenes, cyclonerodiol sesquiterpenes, and so on) are produced by some marine-derived fungal species mainly from the genera Aspergillus, Trichothecium, Graphostroma, and Trichoderma. These compounds display a diverse array of biological activities, including cytotoxic, antibacterial, nitric oxide inhibitory, nematicidal, anti-inflammatory, and growth inhibition of marine phytoplankton activities, which continues to stimulate efforts to discover new sesquiterpenes from nature. Drimane sesquiterpenes, as an important family of sesquiterpenes, showed potent cytotoxic activities against a wide cell variety, including HL-60, SMMC-721, A-549, ACHN, HCT-15, MDA-MB-231, NCI-H23, NUGC-3, and PC-3 cells.In our continuing efforts to identify new bioactive secondary metabolites from marine-derived fungi Aspergillus spp., bioactive investigations on the extract of the fungal strain Aspergillus flavus CF13-11 showed significant cytotoxic activity. Marine-derived Aspergillus flavus is well known for its production of mutagenic mycotoxins and other bioactive compounds (meroterpenoids, indole-diterpenoids, and so on). Our chemical investigations of the fungus CF13-11 using a bioassay-guided method led to the isolation of four toxic C-6/C-7 epimeric drimane sesquiterpene esters, asperienes A–D (1–4) (Figure 1), whose structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and supported by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and Snatzke’s analysis. Herein, we report the isolation, structural elucidation and bioactivities of these compounds.","All of the experimental procedures were the same as in our previously reported work.The fungus CF13-11 was isolated from marine sediment collected from the Bohai Sea in July 2015. This strain, which was identified as Aspergillus flavus according to its 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing of the ITS region (Genbank, KY979507), was deposited in College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hebei University, China. The fermentation (thirty 1-L Erlenmeyer flasks) of the fungus A. flavus CF13-11 was carried out using solid culture (100 g rice and 100 mL water in each Erlenmeyer flask) at 28 °C for 25 days. The fermented medium was extracted with MeOH six times to obtain the crude extract (28.0 g). The crude extract was then partitioned between EtOAc and H2O to give the EtOAc extract (13.0 g), which was subjected to vacuum silica gel column chromatography with a CH2Cl2/MeOH (100:0, 80:1, 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, and 1:1) gradient system to offer seven fractions (F.1–F.7). Among these fractions, F.3 (2.3 g) was separated by using silica gel column chromatography with a petroleum ether/EtOAc gradient system (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) to offer three subfractions (F.3.1–F.3.3). Then, subfraction F.3.2 (95 mg) with certain toxicity was purified by ODS silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and semi-preparative HPLC (Waters C18 column (5 μm, 10 × 250 mm), 2.0 mL/min, MeOH/H2O (70:30)) to give the mixture of compounds 1–4 (26.2 mg). Finally, the epimeric mixture 1/2/3/4 was successfully separated by semi-preparative HPLC on a Daicel Chiralpak IC column using n-hexane/EtOH (78:22) at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min, affording compounds 1 (4.6 mg), 2 (4.4 mg), 3 (4.8 mg), and 4 (4.5 mg).Asperiene A (1): yellow oil.  −180 (c 0.4, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λ max(log ԑ): 261 (2.13) nm; CD (MeOH), λmax (Δε) 211 (‒0.42), 257 (‒0.13) nm; IR (KBr), vmax 3436, 2925, 1775, 1706, 1632, 1451, 1138, 759 cm‒1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1 and Table 2; HRESIMS m/z 443.2030 [M + Na]+ (calcd. for C23H32NaO7, 443.2040).Asperiene B (2): yellow oil.  −203 (c 0.4, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λ max(log ԑ): 261 (2.10) nm; CD (MeOH), λmax (Δε) 210 (‒0.41), 258 (‒0.17) nm; IR (KBr), vmax 3435, 2925, 1776, 1702, 1629, 1449, 1140, 762 cm−1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1 and Table 2; HRESIMS m/z 443.2035 [M + Na]+ (calcd. for C23H32NaO7, 443.2040).Asperiene C (3): yellow oil.  −194 (c 0.4, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λ max(log ԑ): 261 (2.16) nm; CD (MeOH), λmax (Δε) 211 (‒0.41), 259 (−0.15) nm; IR (KBr), vmax 3436, 2923, 1775, 1703, 1637, 1451, 1138, 759 cm−1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1 and Table 2; HRESIMS m/z 443.2027 [M + Na]+ (calcd. for C23H32NaO7, 443.2040).Asperiene D (4): yellow oil.  ‒217 (c 0.4, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λ max(log ԑ): 261 (2.14) nm; CD (MeOH), λmax (Δε) 210 (−0.42), 259 (−0.19) nm; IR (KBr), vmax 3434, 2923, 1775, 1706, 1632, 1452, 1141, 762 cm−1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1 and Table 2; HRESIMS m/z 443.2029 [M + Na]+ (calcd. for C23H32NaO7, 443.2040).The molecular model of (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 was built up and performed for conformational search using MMFF94S force field (BARISTA software, CONFLEX Corporation). Within a 10.0 kcal/mol relative energy window, 120 stable conformers for (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 were given, which were then performed for structural optimizations at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d) levels by density functional theory method. ECD calculations for all of the optimized conformers were carried out at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p) level in gas-phase by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with a total of 60 excited states. All of the above calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 package (Gaussian Inc., Wallingford, CT). Finally, a standard deviation of 0.25 eV was applied for ECD simulations for (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 to give its calculated ECD spectrum.The ECD spectra of compounds 1–4 were firstly recorded to set up as a background spectrum, and then the ICD spectra of Mo-complexes of 1–4 were offered according to the published procedure. The isolated compounds (1–4) and the positive control cisplatin against a panel of cell lines were evaluated for their cytotoxicities in vitro by using MTT method, including human tumor cell lines, HeLa (cervical cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), MGC-803 (gastric cancer), and A549 (lung cancer), together with a non-tumoral cell line, GES-1 (human gastric epithelium). Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 4000 cells (in 100 μL of culture medium) per well (well growth area 0.32 cm2). Each tumor cell line was exposed to each test compound at various concentrations in triplicate for 48 h, with cisplatin used as positive control substances.","Asperiene A (1) (Figure 1) was isolated as a yellow oil with the molecular formula C23H32O7 (eight degrees of unsaturation) by its HR-ESI-MS spectrum. The signals in the 1D spectra of 1 (Table 1 and Table 2, Figures S1 and S2) indicated the presence of two ester carbonyl groups (δC 174.4 C, and 165.4 C), two disubstituted double bonds (δH 7.24 dd, 6.47 dt, 6.33 m, and 5.95 d; δC 145.3 CH, 145.3 CH, 127.3 CH, and 119.8 CH), and one trisubstituted double bond (δH 5.80 s, δC 136.6 C, and 121.4 CH) in 1. These functional groups occupied five of eight degrees of unsaturation in 1, suggesting a tricyclic framework for it. Moreover, three methyl signals with a singlet (δH 1.07 s, 1.07 s, and 0.93 s; 32.1 CH3, 24.3 CH3, and 18.3 CH3) were also observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1. The above characteristic NMR data revealed that 1 should be a drimane-type sesquiterpene with a lactone ring. Comparison of the NMR data of 1 with those of strobilactone B from the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus ustus suggested that 1 shares a similar nucleus structure with the known compound strobilactone B. The main difference between them was the presence of the additional side-chain signals for (2′E,4′E)-5′-carboxypenta-2′,4′-dienoyl moiety (δH 7.24 (1H, dd, J = 15.6, 3.6 Hz, H-3′), 6.47 (1H, dt, J = 15.6, 3.6 Hz, H-4′), 6.33 (1H, m, H-5′), 3.98 (1H, brs, H-6′), 3.57 (1H, t, J = 6.0 Hz, H-7′), and 0.96 (3H, d, J = 6.0 Hz, H-8′); δC 165.4, 145.3, 145.3, 127.3, 119.8, 74.4, 69.3, and 18.2; 1H–1H COSY cross-peaks of H-2′/H-3′/H-4′/H-5′/H-6′/H-7′/H-8′ (Figure 2)) in 1. The HMBC correlations from H-6 proton (δH 5.59) to the C-1′ ester carbonyl demonstrated that the side chain moiety was attached at C-6. Thus, the planar structure for 1 was identified, which was confirmed by a detailed analysis of the HSQC, 1H–1H COSY, and HMBC spectra (Figure 2 and Figures S3–S5) of 1.All of the compounds asperienes A–D (1–4) were obtained with the same molecular formula C23H32O7, and the almost identical 1D and 2D NMR data (Table 1 and Table 2, Figures S1–S27), suggesting that all of 1–4 may be epimers. Upon carefully comparing the 13C NMR spectra of 1–4 (Table 2), the signals, attributable to C-6′, C-7′, and C-8′ in the side chains were found to be different, indicating that 1–4 were stereoisomers differing in the configurations of C-6′ and C-7′.The relative configurations of the sesquiterpenoidal nucleus of 1–4 were determined by their NOESY experiments (Figures S6, S13, S20 and S27), all of which showed NOE correlations from H-15 to H-14, from H-5/H-6 to H-13, and from 9-OH to H-5. The relative configurations of C-6′ and C-7′ in the side chain of 1–4 were assigned by NMR data analysis. The NMR data of the side chain for 1 and 2 ((δC 18.2 (C-8′), δH 3.98 (H-6′), and δH 3.57 (H-7′) for 1; (δC 18.2 (C-8′), δH 3.96 (H-6′), and δH 3.57 (H-7′) for 2) were indicative of an erythro configuration (6′R,7′R or 6′S,7′S) at C-6′ and C-7′ for 1 and 2, according to the literature. Whereas, those of 3 and 4 [(δC 19.2 (C-8′), δH 3.87 (H-6′), and δH 3.49 (H-7′) for 3; (δC 19.3 (C-8′), δH 3.84 (H-6′), and δH 3.48 (H-7′) for 4] hinted at presence of a threo configuration (6′S,7′R or 6′R,7′S) at C-6′ and C-7′ for 3 and 4.In order to assign the absolute configurations of C-6′ and C-7′ in 1–4, induced circular dichroism (ICD) procedure (Snatzke’s method) was carried out for them. The Mo-complexes of 1 (0.5 mg) and dimolybdenum tetraacetate (Mo2(OAc)4) were prepared and used to obtain its ICD spectrum. According to the ICD spectra of the reference Mo-complexes, the negative Cotton effect bands II (near 400 nm) and IV (around 293 nm) in the ICD spectrum of Mo-complexes of 1 (Figure 3) suggested the 6′R,7′R absolute configuration of 1. Accordingly, the absolute configurations of 6′S,7′S, 6′S,7′R, and 6′R,7′S were assigned to compounds 2, 3, and 4, respectively, by the same procedure (Figure 3). Then, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) method was used to assign the absolute configuration of the sesquiterpenoidal nucleus for 1–4. The possible structure (based on the relative configurations of the sesquiterpenoidal nucleus) (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 for 1 was used for ECD quantum chemical calculation and comparison of experimental ECD spectrum of 1. ECD calculations for all of the stable conformers of (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 (Table S1) were performed at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-311+G(d) level in the gas phase by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). ECD simulation for (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 was calculated by Boltzmann statistics (σ 0.25 eV). It was shown that the calculated ECD spectrum of (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 matched well with the experimental ECD spectrum of 1 (Figure 4), indicating that the absolute configuration of 1 could be defined as 5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R. The absolute configurations of the sesquiterpenoidal nucleus in 2–4 could also be assigned as 5S,6R,9S,10S, due to the fact that the ECD spectra of 2–4 were in close and good agreement with that of 1 (Figure 4).In previous literature, drimane sesquiterpene derivatives were reported to possess potent cytotoxic activities toward multiple tumor cell lines. Therefore, the cytotoxic activities of 1–4 to four tumor cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7, MGC-803, and A549) were tested. All of the asperienes A–D (1–4) showed significant cytotoxic activities against these four cell lines (IC50, 1.4–8.3 μM) (Figure 5). Among them, compound 1 exhibited the strongest activity to MCF-7 cells with the IC50 value of 1.4 μM. Interestingly, the toxicities for 1–4 toward GES-1 cells were also examined, with the different IC50 values of 78, 6.2, 4.9, and 83 μM, respectively (Tables S2 and S3).","Drimane sesquiterpene derivatives are a structurally variable family of natural terpenoids mainly obtained from fungi and plants. However, many derivatives of these drimane sesquiterpenoids were esterified at C-6 with fatty acyl moieties, which possibly contained more than one stereogenic carbon. These stereogenic carbons in the side chains of the drimane sesquiterpenoids resulted in the presence of many epimers, which were difficult to separate from each other due to their close polarity. Further, it was difficult to determine the absolute configurations of these stereogenic carbons due to the high conformational flexibility of the chains in them. In fact, two of four sesquiterpenoidal epimers (1–4) have been previously obtained from an algicolous Aspergillus ustus as inseparable epimeric mixtures, whose absolute configurations were also not assigned. In the course of our study, the epimers 1–4 were firstly obtained as a mixture with a ratio of 1:1:1:1. In order to separate these two pair of epimers, HPLC separation was tried on Daicel Chiralpak IA, IB, IC, ID, OB, and OD columns with different mobile phases, including various combinations of n-hexane/IPA or n-hexane/EtOH solvents. Fortunately, 1–4 were separated successfully from each other by using n-hexane/EtOH (78:22) on Chiralpak IC column. Further, in the present research, Snatzke’s method was used as a powerful chemical approach for the configurational investigation of these four sesquiterpenoidal epimers (1–4).Aspergillus flavus is well known as a saprotrophic fungus that infects and contaminates preharvest and postharvest seed crops, such as corn (maize), rice, and peanut (groundnuts). A. flavus infections are notorious for carcinogenic and mutagenic mycotoxin production, which causes enormous agricultural economic loss and poses significant risk to both humans and domestic animals. Among these mycotoxins, the aflatoxins produced by A. flavus have been extensively studied and proven to be major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma or aspergillosis in Southeast Asia and Africa. However, the fungus A. flavus also could generate the other structurally versatile mycotoxins because it consists of a large number of biosynthetic gene clusters. These diversified mycotoxins from the fungus A. flavus, which are minor components but have certain toxicities, may not have been specifically surveyed and may have potent biological activities. Thus, the purpose of this research was to isolate and characterize new toxic natural products with potent bioactivities from the marine-derived fungal strain A. flavus CF13-11 to shed much light on a better understanding of the mycotoxins produced by A. flavus. The results suggested that the configuration at C-6′ in 1–4 may play an important role for the toxicity. The results also indicated that compounds 1 and 4 with higher activities and lower toxicities might have more potential for the development of an antitumor agent, but compounds 2 and 3 were the minor mycotoxins produced by A. flavus.","Four toxic C-6/C-7 epimeric drimane sesquiterpene esters, asperienes A–D (1–4) (Figure 1), were obtained from the fungus A. flavus CF13-11. ECD and Snatzke’s methods were applied to assign the absolute configurations of 1–4. Cell models, including four tumor cells and one normal cell, were used to evaluate the toxicities and bioactivities of 1–4. This work suggested that the minor mycotoxins produced by A. flavus may have potent biological activities."
37,TA042027,10.3390/molecules28104147,Synthesis of Chitosan Oligosaccharide-Loaded Glycyrrhetinic Acid FunctionalizedMesoporous Silica Nanoparticles and In Vitro Verification of the Treatment ofAPAP-Induced Liver Injury.,"OBJECTIVE: the study was to find a suitable treatment for acute drug-inducedliver injury. The use of nanocarriers can improve the therapeutic effect ofnatural drugs by targeting hepatocytes and higher loads. METHODS: firstly,uniformly dispersed three-dimensional dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres(MSNs) were synthesized. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) was covalently modified on MSNsurfaces through amide bond and then loaded with COSM to form drug-loadednanoparticles (COSM@MSN-NH(2)-GA). The constructed drug-loaded nano-deliverysystem was determined by characterization analysis. Finally, the effect ofnano-drug particles on cell viability was evaluated and the cell uptake in vitrowas observed. RESULTS: GA was successfully modified to obtain the sphericalnano-carrier MSN-NH(2)-GA (≤200 nm). The neutral surface charge improves itsbiocompatibility. MSN-NH(2)-GA has high drug loading (28.36% ± 1.00) because ofits suitable specific surface area and pore volume. In vitro cell experimentsshowed that COSM@MSN-NH(2)-GA significantly enhanced the uptake of liver cells(LO2) and decreased the AST and ALT indexes. CONCLUSION: this study demonstratedfor the first time that formulation and delivery schemes using natural drug COSMand nanocarrier MSN have a protective effect on APAP-induced hepatocyte injury.This result provides a potential nano-delivery scheme for the targeted therapy ofacute drug-induced liver injury.","Guo, Xinghua, Zhang, Chengcheng, Bai, Yan, Che, Qishi, Cao, Hua, Guo, Jiao, Su, Zhengquan",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"Acetaminophen (APAP), which is also known as N-acetyl-p-aminophenol or paracetamol, is among the most frequently used tablets due to its analgesic and antipyretic properties. Especially in the era of the COVID-19 virus epidemic, because of its low price and significant effect on fighting fever and muscle soreness, it is often combined with other drugs and is easily overused frequently. Therefore, the safety of APAP is questionable. Studies have shown that its overdose might lead to hepatotoxicity and acute liver failure (ALF). APAP mediates the formation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine through cytochrome P450 in the human body, leading to mitochondrial oxidative stress and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which will lead to nuclear translocation of mitochondrial proteins and induce DNA fragmentation, eventually leading to liver cell necrosis. The drug-induced liver damage (DILI) observed with APAP is the second main reason for liver transplantation in humans. APAP-induced DILI is responsible for 50% of cases of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe, whereas in China, APAP-induced DILI is responsible for 50.8% of all cases of anti-inflammatory- and analgesic-induced DILI; therefore, it is urgent to develop safer and more effective drugs to treat liver injury induced by APAP. At present, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the only clinically approved antidote for APAP-induced liver damage. Because of its poor bioavailability, complicated drugs, limited administration time, and many side effects, it is necessary to design and construct a new nano-drug delivery system to find a solution.Mesoporous silicon nanocarriers (MSNs) have high drug loading capacity and can load small molecular drugs, especially hydrophobic drugs. Up to now, MSNs have been developed for targeted drug, gene and protein delivery, and composite nano-drugs for diagnostic biological imaging, tissue engineering, cancer treatment, vaccine development, biomaterials, and diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, nano-loaded drugs can avoid drug degradation and physiological toxicity to healthy tissues caused by the premature exposure of drugs. Mesoporous silica with various specific modifications has attracted people’s interest as the carrier of nanoparticle drug delivery system. This approach enhances cellular-specific uptake to increase intracellular drug concentration and retain the drug in the targeted tissue. In addition, targeted nanoparticles include excessive drug load and ensure targeted delivery and improve bioavailability.Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is an active aglycone of glycyrrhizic acid. Studies have proven that GA has numerous advisable pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antiulcer activities. Because GA molecules can provide a hydrophobic moiety and bind liver-targeting ligands, GA-mediated drug carrier structures have emerged as a novel liver-targeting platform. Studies have confirmed that GA receptors are present on the surface of liver (parenchymal) cell membranes, and GA can be highly accumulated in the liver. Studies have confirmed that GA receptors are present on the surface of liver (parenchymal) cell membranes, and GA can be highly accumulated in the liver. Compared to carriers not modified with GA, those modified with GA were reported to be more effective in livers or in targeting livers. In addition, GA-modified nanoparticles may exhibit an ability to distinguish normal liver tissue from diseased or damaged liver tissue, resulting in higher therapeutic efficacy and safety. In a word, it is a very promising scheme to embed GA into MSN and load drugs to treat diseases in the liver.COSM, with an average molecular weight of less than 3000, is a natural product extracted from shrimp and crab shells that exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and other biological activities. Our research group has performed research on chitosan and chitosan oligosaccharide regarding weight loss and liver protection for a long time. In particular, the team has a good research foundation on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and mechanisms of chitosan oligosaccharide on the liver. Previous studies have found that COSM has a good protective effect on liver injury. In this study, GA was selected as the target ligand to be covalently modified on the structure of MSNs. The ensuing glycyrrhetinic acid-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-NH2-GA) have potential for transferring unique capsules to LO2 cells. COSM, a polysaccharide product with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, was loaded into MSN-NH2-GA. The covalent bond between GA and MSN was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The structures and morphologies of MSNs and MSN-NH2-GA were investigated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). LO2 cells were selected to explore the cytotoxicity and cell uptake by focusing on the effectiveness of COSM-loaded MSN-NH2-GA.","The following substances were purchased from industrial suppliers and used as received. Triethanolamine (TEA), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and diethyl ether were all biochemically obtained from MACKLIN Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Cyclohexane, absolute ethanol, and methanol were all provided by Tianjin Damao Reagent Factory (Tianjin, China). Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), and 1-octadecene (ODE) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Trading Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Unless otherwise indicated, all solvents were of analytical grade and were used without purification.24 mL (25 wt %) CTAC solution and 0.09 g TEA were added to 36 mL distilled water and stirred at 150 rpm for 1 h. Then, 20 mL of ODE solution containing TEOS (10 v/v %) was added and reacted at 70 °C for 24 h to obtain MSN. MSN-NH2 was obtained by adding MSN to 25 mL anhydrous ethanol, adding 2.0 mL APTES, and reacting at 30 °C for 24 h. GA-NHS was obtained by adding 0.52 g NHS, 0.94 g DCC, and 1.0 g GA into 20 mL DMSO, and reacting at 40 °C for 24 h. Finally, GA-NHS and MSN-NH2 were added to DMSO and stirred at 60 °C for 24 h. MSN-NH2-GA was obtained by washing with DMSO and anhydrous ethanol for 3 times. Please see attachment Figure S1 for details.FTIR spectra were obtained using an FTIR spectrophotometer (VERTEX 70v, Bruker GmbH, Bremen, Germany) to determine the profitable synthesis of MSN-NH2 and MSN-GA. The dimension distribution and zeta potential of the pattern nanoparticles were explored using a laser particle dimension analyser (Delsa, Beckman Technology Co., Ltd., Durahm, NC, USA). The morphologies of MSN and MSN-NH2-GA were observed by TEM (Tecnai G2 F20, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (XFlash 6130, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The unique structures and pore dimension distribution traits of MSN and MSN-NH2-GA were determined by nitrogen adsorption (ASAP2460, American Mack Instruments Co., Ltd., Colonial Heights, VA, USA).Chitosan oligosaccharide (COSM) was purchased from Shandong Aokang Biotechnology Co., Ltd., with batch number of 200409C, degree of deacetylation (DD) of 90.2%, and molecular weight of 1000 Da. To study the loading ability of COSM on the prepared nanoparticles, 10 mg of nanocarrier MSN-NH2-GA was placed into 10 mL of ethanol solution at room temperature and ultrasonically dispersed for approximately 10 min. Then, 10 mg of COSM was added and stirred slowly on a magnetic stirrer for 12 h. Finally, a high-speed centrifuge was used for centrifugation to collect the lower drug-loaded nanoparticles, which were freeze-dried for storage. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves were obtained using a synchronous thermal analyser (STA449, Netzsch, Selb, Germany) with a temperature range of 20 °C to 300 °C and a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The determination method of COSM content was established by DNS method, and the absorbance of COSM was determined by multifunctional enzyme-labeled instrument (MAXM4, Meigu Molecular Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and the standard curve of COSM was drawn (Figure S3). The amounts of COSM in the nanoparticles were measured.The encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of COSM in the nanoparticles was calculated using the following formula:The load capacity (LC%) of COSM in the nanoparticles was calculated using the following formula:The cell line was purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and was cryopreserved at the Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, with the human foetal hepatocyte LO2 mobile line. The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum and 1% FBS in a humidified incubator with a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. This protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University.First, LO2 cells were cultured and observed by microscope. Then, according to the previous experimental results (see attachment: Figure S2, Tables S1 and S2), the administration components were divided into high, medium, and low (H, M, L) COSM, (H, M, L) MSN-NH2-GA nanoparticles and (H, M, L) COSM@MSN-NH2-GA nanomedicine, with 8 replicate wells in each group. APAP was added at the modelling concentration for 12 h, the model group was treated with APAP only, the clean group was treated with an identical amount of medium, and the experimental group was treated with free drug COSM, nanoparticles MSN-NH2-GA, and the nanodrug COSM@MSN-NH2-GA and cultured for 12 h.The cytopathological state was observed to evaluate the therapeutic effect. In this study, the optimal concentration and time of APAP for modeling were screened (see attachment: Figure S4), and the cell viability was measured by CCK-8 method as the evaluation index. First, the cell culture medium was collected and centrifuged, and the contents of AST (C010-3-1, Nanjing Jiancheng Biological Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) and ALT (C009-3-1, Nanjing Jiancheng Biological Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) were measured according to the kit instructions. The survival state of adherent cells was detected by the CCK-8 method.Coumarin-6 (C6) is a liposoluble dye with strong fluorescence. It is commonly used in cellular uptake studies with nanoformulations. LO2 hepatocytes with cell viability meeting the experimental requirements were inoculated into a 24-well plate and incubated for more than 12 h until 80% of the cells adhered to the wall. The C6 solution and C6-NP nanosolution were diluted with serum-free medium so that both groups of C6 concentrations were 800 ng/mL and were washed 3 times with PBS. After culturing for 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h, the original medium was discarded, subjected to three 5 min washes with PBS, incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and washed 4 times with PBS after fixation. In a dark environment, the anti-fluorescence-quenching suspension-containing DAPI was dropped on the glass slide, and then the cell slide was placed upside down on the glass slide to complete the suspension. A fluorescence microscope was used for observation and analysis.LO2 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 20 w cells/well and incubated for more than 12 h, and cell adherence was observed. When more than 80% of the cells adhered, the coumarin solution and coumarin-labelled C6-NPs were diluted with minimal medium so that the fluorescein concentration was 800 ng/mL. Time gradients were set as 5 min, 1 h, and 2 h. After incubation for corresponding time in each group, cells were collected by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended with 300 μL PBS and detected by flow cytometry.","The nanomedicine, labelled COSM@MSN-NH2-GA, was synthesized in several steps (Scheme 1). Briefly, uniformly dispersed three-dimensional dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres were synthesized by referring to the preparation method by Shen’s team. These 3D dendritic MSNs exhibit unique advantages in protein loading and release due to their adjustable large porosity and intelligent layered mesostructure. More importantly, the release rate depends in part on graded biodegradation as 3D dendritic MSNs with larger pore sizes have a faster rate of biological interpretation. In this study, GA was selected as the target ligand, and by grafting alkoxysilane, MSNs were externally functionalized and finally anchored by amino reaction with amino-modified GA. COSM was loaded in ethanol by impregnation. The formed glycyrrhetinic acid-functionalized MSN nanoparticles exhibit the potential to specifically deliver drugs to hepatocytes.As shown in Figure 1a,b, SEM revealed that the MSN nanoparticles are spherical and exhibit a uniform particle size distribution. TEM showed that the MSN nanoparticles are spherical with clear and uniform mesoporous channels on the surface and a uniform particle size, which is consistent with the SEM results. After targeted modification, MSN-NH2-GA nanoparticles with a uniform particle size and complete morphology were obtained. The particle size distributions of MSN and MSN-NH2-GA nanoparticles are (156.7 ± 61.7) nm and (190.7 ± 78.1) nm, respectively (Figure 1c). The particle size of the nanoparticles gradually increases with the modification process. The nanoparticles are dispersed in different solvents, and the measured particle size is also inconsistent because the DLS measurement conditions are in aqueous solution. Therefore, the DLS results are slightly larger than the TEM particle size results. The zeta potential of the nanoparticles also reflects the macroscopic changes in the surface modification of the nanoparticles. Figure 1d shows that the zeta potential of the blank MSN was −40.42 ± 22.11 mV due to the presence of silanol groups on the MSN surface and its negative charge. After amino modification occurred, the amino group (positively charged) replaced silanol (which is negatively charged), so the zeta potential changed from negative to positive, and the zeta potential of MSN-NH2 was 58.62 ± 4.479 mV. When glycyrrhetinic acid was docked, part of the amino group was consumed and covered so that the positive charge decreased, and the zeta potential of MSN-NH2-GA became (7.013 ± 4.132) mV.To decide the chemical grafting of exceptional practical groups, MSN, MSN-NH2 and MSN-NH2-GA were characterised using distinct methods and after every reaction step. Using FTIR spectroscopy, we can see the functionalization manner of nanoparticles. Figure 2 shows that all samples show the skeleton absorption peaks of silicon-based materials, namely, the Si-O-Si symmetrical stretching vibration peak (800 cm−1), the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching vibration peak (1085 cm−1), and the Si-OH stretching vibration peak (960 cm−1). The infrared spectra peaks of MSN-NH2 are located at 2922 cm−1 and 2855 cm−1, which are the C-H stretching vibrations of APTES, indicating that the amino group was correctly modified. The amide II band at 1445 cm−1 and the C=C stretching vibration of GA at 1545 cm−1 indicate that the GA molecule is modified to MSN by amide bonds.As seen in Figure 3a,b, the adsorption isotherm conforms to the Langmuir IV isotherm, and the nanomaterial exhibits a mesoporous structure. It can be seen that, when the relative pressure P/P0 < 0.35, N2 is present on the surface of the material channel. With single molecule and multimolecular layer adsorption, the amount of adsorption slowly increases. Under a relative pressure of 0.35 < P/P0 < 0.8, an obvious capillary condensation step can be observed, and the adsorption amount increases, indicating that the pore size distribution is wide. When 0.8 < P/P0 < 0.9, the nitrogen adsorption and the outer surface curve are gentle. When P/P0 > 0.9, there is a hysteresis loop. At this time, nitrogen adsorption occurs in the gap between the particles, the adsorption capacity increases, and the curve shows an additional large jump. The postgrafting method was used to modify the targeting group so that group modification would also occur in the pores of the nanoparticles. Figure 3b shows that the modification of amino and glycyrrhetinic acids exhibited a certain covering effect on the nanoparticles. As seen in Figure 4a,b, the MSNs had specific surfaces of 565.27 m2/g, contained pores with a size of 6.15 nm, and a volume of 1.18 cm3/g. MSN-NH2-GA had specific surface areas of 245.83 m2/g, showed pores with a size of 6.04 nm, and a volume of 0.69 cm3/g. Therefore, the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of MSN-NH2-GA decreased accordingly.To identify the COSM API, nanocarriers (MSN-NH2-GA), physically mixed groups, and nanopharmaceutical groups, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed. The results are shown in Figure 5. The black (A), red (B), blue (C), and green (D) curves represent the COSM, nanocarrier (MSN-NH2-GA), physical mixing, and nanomedicine (COSM@MSN-NH2-GA) groups, respectively. COSM exhibits an obvious single-melting endothermic peak at approximately 200 °C, while the nanocarrier (MSN-NH2-GA) group shows an obvious dehydration peak at approximately 100 °C. The DSC analysis of the physically mixed group contains characteristic absorption peaks of the carriers and COSM, which was because the drug and the carriers were simply mixed. In the DSC analysis of the nanodrug group, the characteristic absorption peak of the main drug (COSM) disappeared, indicating that COSM was present in an amorphous form in the nanodrug group and was no longer present in a crystalline state. These observations indicate that COSM was successfully incorporated into the mesoporous channels of MSN-NH2-GA. According to the previous experiments, the feasibility of using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) as a method for the determination of COSM content was determined, and the specific determination conditions were finally optimized and screened out. In the drug loading experiment, the dosage ratio of COSM and MSN-NH2-GA is 1:2, and the drug loading time is 12 h, which is the best drug loading condition. The encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was 28.36% and the load capacity (LC%) was 56.72%.LO2 was cultivated, 8000–10,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate were seeded, the cell state with a microscope was observed after about 10–12 h of culture; APAP modelling groups were set at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 mM. APAP was given to each group according to the preset setting, and the culture was continued for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h; the cell survival rate was measured by CCK-8 method, and the optimal concentration and time for modelling were determined. According to the results of nanomedicine cytotoxicity, the dosage of COSM@MSN-NH2-GA group was low dose (200 μg/mL), medium dose (400 μg/mL), high dose (800 μg/mL); in total, there was a group of six duplicate holes. The drug loading of COSM@MSN-NH2-GA is 28.36% ± 1.00%. By equivalent conversion, the dosage of the free drug COSM was low dose (56 μg/mL), medium dose (113 μg/mL), high dose (226 μg/mL); in total, eight duplicate wells were in each group, and they continued to culture for 12 h after adding the COSM drug. The experiment and results of this part are shown in the annex.LO2 hepatocytes were treated with APAP for 12 h and then treated with COSM, MSN-NH2-GA, and COSM@MSN-NH2-GA for 12 h. Then, the growth state of the cells were observed under the microscope. As shown in Figure 6, in the blank nanocarrier groups, MSN-NH2-GA(L), MSN-NH2-GA(M), and MSN-NH2-GA(H), basically no difference in the cell state and the number of dead cells was observed. This indicated that the blank nanocarrier did not improve the decrease of cell viability caused by APAP at each dose. Compared with the MOD group, the cell viability was not affected, which preliminarily proved that the nanoparticles were a safe and non-toxic nanocarrier. In the free drug group, the cell state of the COSM (L) group was close to that of the APAP model group, the normal hepatocytes in the COSM (M) and COSM (H) groups increased, the cell morphology was more normal, and the number of dead cells decreased. Each group treated with the nanodrug showed a decrease in the number of dead cells, but the middle-dose group and the high-dose group displayed the most pronounced effects of cell treatment due to the more normalized cell morphology and lower number of dead cells in these groups. The model group generally showed a substantially higher number of dead cells and significantly fewer normal liver cells than the normal control group. In addition, the appearance of many dead cells changed, displaying abnormal forms and decreased cell activity.The contents of ALT and AST in the medium were determined by collecting the culture medium, and the therapeutic effect of each administration group on APAP-induced LO2 hepatocyte injury was detected by CCK-8 method. As shown in Table 1, COSM@MSN-NH2-GA (M) and COSM@MSN-NH2-GA (H) treatment groups significantly increased hepatocyte survival and inhibited hepatocyte injury. In addition, compared with the APAP model group, the nanomedicine treatment could significantly reduce the contents of ALT and AST in the culture medium, as shown in Figure 7. In the high-dose group, compared to the free COSM, the nano-drug COSM@MSN-NH2-GA showed a more significant decrease in the indexes of ALT and AST. It can be speculated that the glycyrrhetinic acid receptor (GAR), as the most commonly used targeting effect, is overexpressed in hepatocytes. MSN-NH2-GA uses a receptor-mediated strategy to improve delivery efficiency and achieve better therapeutic effect. Taken together, the results indicated that COSM@MSN-NH2-GA could treat APAP-induced hepatocyte injury. Therefore, the combined use of COSM and MSN-NH2-GA can improve the vitality of hepatocytes and provide great hope for the treatment of APAP-induced hepatocyte injury.In this experiment, fluorescence microscopy was used to observe the cellular uptake behaviour of nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 8, at 5 min, no fluorescence could be observed in the C6-NP group, but blue nuclei stained with DAPI could be clearly observed. After 1 h, fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm of the cells. The fluorescence intensity of the C6-NP group was significantly enhanced, indicating that the targeted nanoparticles showed higher cell uptake ability. At 2 h, the fluorescence intensity of the C6-NP groups confirmed an increasing trend. In the C6-NP group, the Merge diagram showed mixed blue and green light, and the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cells exhibited much fluorescence. This result may be due to the above-mentioned specific GA-receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism, and a large number of C6-NPs nanoparticles are internalized by LO2 cells.In this experiment, flow cytometry was performed to analyse the cell uptake behaviour of nanoparticles (Figure 9). At 5 min, the fluorescence intensity of the free coumarin group (938.6 ± 115.7) was not considerably longer than that of the C6-NP group (923.8 ± 27.4). At 1 h, the cell fluorescence intensity of the nanoparticle group was maintained at a high level (11378.07 ± 2692.05), which was appreciably different from that of the free drug group (3082.83 ± 220.94). With increases in the reaction time, the fluorescence intensity of the nanoparticle group reached 12991.77 ± 2303.26 at 2 h, whereas the fluorescence intensity of the free drug group was 4746.3 ± 1990.77. This finding shows that compared with free drugs, targeted modified nanoparticles exhibit a stronger drug transport ability and are more easily taken up by cells.Overall, the uptake of glycyrrhetinic-acid-modified nanomedicines by cells was better. The results of fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry showed that the glycyrrhetinic-acid-modified nanoparticles exhibited a higher fluorescence intensity than that of the free C6 group at the same time and showed stronger fluorescence intensity faster, indicating that the treatment can significantly increase the uptake of nanomedicines by LO2 cells.",,"In this study, a multifunctional drug delivery carrier based on glycyrrhetinic acid embedded in silica nanoparticles was successfully synthesized. Not only does MSN-NH2-GA show satisfactory loading ability, but also it enhances its biocompatibility. The successful synthesis of MSN-NH2-GA was verified by FTIR, SEM and zeta potential measurement. In vitro studies show that this kind of nontoxic nanoparticles can significantly enhance the uptake of cells. The COSM drug has a protective effect on liver cell injury induced by APAP. In particular, the delivery of COSM through MSN-NH2-GA can greatly improve the therapeutic effect on LO2 cells. In summary, COSM@MSN-NH2-GA is a non-toxic, stable and efficient nano-therapeutic drug for acute liver injury. The results of this study provide a potential nanodelivery platform for the targeted therapy of acute liver injury."
38,TA043641,10.3390/plants11131627,Chemical Diversity and Anti-Insect Activity Evaluation of Essential OilsExtracted from Five Artemisia Species.,"As a source of aromatic plants, the genus Artemisia has long been considered tohave the potential to develop plant pesticides. In this study, components ofessential oils from A. dalai-lamae, A. tangutica, A. sieversiana, A.tanacetifolia and A. ordosica were identified by GC-MS. A total of 56constituents were analysed, and each species consisted of 9 to 24 constituents.Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed that A. dalai-lamae, A. tangutica andA. tanacetifolia are characterised by monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenatedmonoterpenes. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed the most remarkablesimilarity between A. sieversiana and A. ordosica, but the similarity was stilllower than 50%. Contact toxicity and repellency of essential oils were evaluatedby bioassays; A. ordosica oil exhibited the most substantial contact toxicity(LD50 = 52.11 μg/cm2) against Liposcelis bostrychophila, while A. tangutica oilshowed the most potent contact toxicity (LD50 = 17.42 μg/adult) against Triboliumcastaneum. Except for A. dalai-lamae, the other four species showed the samelevel (p > 0.05) of repellent activity as the positive control against both pestsat high concentrations. The results indicated that these five Artemisia specieshad high chemical diversity and great potential to be developed into moreeffective and environmentally friendly anti-insect agents.","Zhang, Jia-Wei, Li, Bo-Ya, Lu, Xin-Xin, Zheng, Yu, Wang, Dan, Zhang, Zhe, Zeng, Ding, Du, Shu-Shan",2022,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"Insecticides are an effective method of controlling storage pests, of which synthetic insecticides have been demonstrated to impact environmental protection and health safety negatively. This phenomenon promoted the growing exploration of botanical pesticides. Plant secondary metabolites are important sources of botanical insecticides and have proven insecticidal and repellent effects in practice. Increasing studies have shown that essential oils mainly extracted from aromatic plants have great potential against arthropod species. The genus Artemisia, one of the largest genera of the family Compositae, consists of nearly 500 species worldwide, and about 190 species are found in China. High concentrations and significant intraspecific variations of volatile terpenes in essential oil generated the strong and diverse odour of the Artemisia genus. The compositional diversity of essential oils of several Artemisia species has been reported. A. dracunculus was rich in (Z)-anethole (81.0%), A. scoparia was rich in α-thujone (81.7%), while 67% of camphor was the main component of A. fragans.The positive repellent and insecticidal activities of essential oils derived from Artemisia species have been in the limelight owing to the abundant volatile components. Essential oils extracted from three Artemisia species, including A. absinthium, A. spicigera and A. santonicum, were toxic to Sitophilus granaries. Oils from cultivated A. absinthium had better repellent activity against Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum than the commercial ones. A. capillaris and A. mongolica essential oils showed significant toxicity against Sitophilus zeamais. Little research was conducted on A. dalai-lamae and A. tangutica, the endemic species in China. Terpenoids, lignans, flavonoids, and various compounds were isolated from A. sieversiana. Some of these components showed several biological activities such as anti-tumour, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-hypertensive, and anti-hyperglycemic activities. The methanolic extract of the leaves of A. tanacetifolia afforded several kinds of coumarins, and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid was detected from the aerial parts of flowering A. tanacetifolia. Essential oil from A. ordosica has the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory, haemostasis, treating rheumatoid arthritis, parotiditis, abdominal distension, intestinal obstruction and ischuria. Although numerous studies have shown that Artemisia species has various pharmacological effects, still little is known concerning the insecticidal activity of these five Artemisia species.In this study, we reported the essential oils from five species in the genera Artemisia (A. dalai-lamae, A. tangutica, A. sieversiana, A. tanacetifolia and A. ordosica) and provided a comparative investigation of these five species’ chemical composition, repellent, and contact potential for Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel and Tribolium castaneum Herbst adults.","Plant materials were included the aerial parts of A. dalai-lamae, A. tangutica, A. sieversiana, A. tanacetifolia and A. ordosica. They were collected in the Gansu, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia provinces, China, respectively, and voucher specimens were deposited at the herbarium of Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University. The species of plants were identified by Dr. Liu, Q.-R. (College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China). Table 2 summarises the collecting information of these samples. The plant materials were dried in the shade and coarsely ground. Then, the grounded materials were subjected to 6 h of hydrodistillation using a modified Clevenger type apparatus, and the cooled essential oils were dehydrated by anhydrous sodium sulphate. The final oils were stored in sealed containers in the refrigerator at 4 °C.Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed with an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, DE, USA) equipped with a flame ionisation detector (FID). A HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) capillary column was used to distinguish the compounds. A 1.0 mL/min flow rate helium was used as a carrier gas. Then, 1 μL of 1% essential oil–n-hexane solution was injected, and the injector temperature was 250 °C. The oven temperature was programmed as follows as 50 °C for 2 min, increased at 2 °C/min to 150 °C for 2 min, then increased at 10 °C/min to 250 °C for 5 min.Constituents were identified by comparing their retention indices (RI) with those reported in the literature, and by matching their mass spectra with those stored in NIST 05, Wiley 275 libraries or literature. The GC-FID peak area (%) was used to obtain the relative percentages of each individual component of the essential oils.A 10:1:1(w/w/w) mixture of flour, milk powder and yeast was used to rear L. bostrychophila, whether T. castaneum was fed with wheat flour mixed with yeast (10:1, w/w). The colonies were maintained in the dark incubators at 28–29 °C and 70–80% RH. The mixed-sex adults used in repellent and contact assays were about 7 ± 2 days old. The edges of containers and the Petri dishes for L. bostrychophila were smeared with polytetrafluoroethylene to ensure escape-proofing.The repellence assay was performed using the area preference method. Five doses of 63.17, 12.63, 2.53, 0.51 and 0.10 nL/cm2 were made by serial dilution in n-hexane for the repellent assay applied against L. bostrychophila adults. Filter papers with a 5.5 cm diameter were cut in half. Each tested solution (150 μL) was applied to half-cut filter paper as the experimental group, and n-hexane (150 μL) was used in another half as the control group. The treated filter papers were air-dried to evaporate the solvent completely. Then, both semi-circular filter papers were attached to their opposite sides and placed in Petri dishes (Φ = 5.5 cm). Meanwhile, for T. castaneum, the filter papers and Petri dishes were prepared at 9 cm in diameter. The five tested concentrations were 78.63, 15.73, 3.15, 0.63 and 0.13 nL/cm2, and 500 μL of testing solution or n-hexane were treated on each semi-circular filter paper. Twenty insects were released at the centre of the Petri dishes and covered with lids for all tests. The dishes were then placed in the dark incubators in the same condition as raring. Five replications were used for each concentration. The positive control was conducted by DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide, Dr. Ehrenstorfer, Germany). The numbers of insects present on different sides of the paper were recorded after 2 and 4 h.The contact toxicity of the essential oils was conducted as follows. The appropriate testing concentrations were determined for all bioassays based on range-finding studies. Then, the desired quantity of each sample was dissolved in n-hexane to obtain a series of concentrations as the testing solution. When it came to L. bostrychophila adults, 300 μL of the solutions of the essential oils were applied to a round filter paper of 5.5 cm in diameter. Then the treated filter paper was attached to the bottom of Petri dishes of the same size as the filter papers. Ten insects in each treatment were put in the Petri dishes. All the Petri dishes were covered by lids and kept in the incubator. For the bioassays with T. castaneum adults, 0.5 μL of solutions were applied to the insects’ dorsal thorax. Ten treated insects with the same solution were transferred into one vial, and reared in the incubator. After 24 h, the number of deaths was checked and recorded. The n-hexane was used as the negative control, and pyrethrin (pyrethrin I and II, 37%) was used as the positive control. The experiments were replicated five times.Principle component analysis (PCA) was used to explain the dissimilarities between samples. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to evaluate the similarity of the samples based on the type and quantity of compounds from essential oils. PCA was conducted by R Studio (version 4.1.3) with FactoMineR and factoextra packages. HCA was performed with Minitab 17 by using the complete linkage and Euclidean distance measure methods. A dendrogram was constructed to express the result.The percentage repellency (PR) was calculated to measure the repellent activity of essential oils, which was computed by the foluma as below:Nc and Nt are the numbers of insects in the negative control and treated half, respectively. Then the analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and Tukey’s test were conducted using SPSS 20.0. For the contact toxicity test, LD50 was calculated by Probit analysis using SPSS 20.0. The 95% FL (fiducial interval), Slope ± SE, p-value and χ2 were also recorded.","Essential oils of the five plants aerial parts were obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by GC-MS. The major chemical compounds are presented in Table 1. The data of A. ordosica were drawn from Zhang et al. (2017). The yields of five Artemisia species essential oils ranged from 0.02% to 0.53% (v/w%, Table 2). The chemical composition of these oils is different. A. tanacetifolia essential oil contains substantial amounts of 3-carene (45.98%) and β-pinene (15.13%), which were absent in other samples. The major components of A. sieversiana are neryl propanoate (22.88%), β-nerol (11.01%) and β-cubebene (7.50%), whereas cineol (32.62%), 3,7-dimethyl-1,5,7-octatriene-3-ol (15.85%), and santolina triene (14.45%) are the major compounds of A. dalai-lamae. Unlike A. dalai-lamae, A. ordosica yielded oil which is rich in caryophyllene (17.81%), β-bisabolene (12.11%), spathulenol (10.56%) and β-caryophyllene oxide (8.67%). In addition, the five essential oils also have similar sets of main components: caryophyllene (0.91–17.81%), camphor (1.32–51.07%), linalool (0.56–1.34%), α-terpineol (0.92–3.69%), 4-terpineol (1.12–11.97%) and nerolidol (0.24–1.47%) existing in at least three oils.Twenty-five compounds with a concentration > 3% (for these components were rich enough for describe the characteristics of essential oils) were selected to perform PCA. PCA was used to determine the impacts and differences of the most important compounds. The contributions to the first two components of each chemical are shown in Figure 1a. β-Elemene (23), caryophyllene (26), β-bisabolene (35), myristicine (37), β-caryophyllene oxide (41) and (E)-phytol (52) gave the contribution of over 10% to PC1; α-terpineol (18) β-cubebene (24) and elixene (29) gave over 10% of contribution to PC2; over 15% of contribution was contributed by β-pinene (5), sylvestrene (8) and germacrene D (33). The bi-plot of PCA is shown in Figure 1b. PC1 and PC2 described 62.45% of the total variances. PC1 had the highest positive correlation with 3-carene (3), and the highest negative correlation with camphor (14). PC2 was represented mainly by cineol (9) in the positive score. A. dalai-lamae, A. tangutica and A. tanacetifolia were characterised by monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes. A. sieversiana was characterised by oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and neryl propanoate (28). Moreover, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, and a diterpene, (E)-phytone, etc., could describe the chemical character of A. ordosica. A dendrogram of HCA revealed the similarity of these Artemisia species (Figure 2). A. sieversiana and A. ordosica had the greatest similarity, but the similarity rate was lower than 50%. A. tangutica was spread from the other four species with a minimum likeness. The repellent rates at 2 and 4 h after exposure to essential oils derived from five Artemisia species against L. bostrychophila and T. castaneum are shown in Figure 3, respectively. The repellent effect of essential oils on both two pests showed various levels. When compared with the positive control, DEET, at both 2 and 4 h after exposure, all five oils possessed the same level of repellent activity (p > 0.05) at a testing concentration of 63.17 nL/cm2 for L. bostrychophila and 78.63 nL/cm2 for T. castaneum. The essential oil of A. tangutica, A. sieversiana, A. tanacetifolia and A. ordosica also showed comparable repellent levels with the positive control (p > 0.05) at the concentration of 12.63 nL/cm2 against L. bostrychophila and 15.73 nL/cm2 for T. castaneum adults. It is worth noting that A. tangutica and A. sieversiana were found to have attraction effects against these two insects at the lowest concentration. Among the oils, A. ordosica showed outstanding repellent activity and possessed the same (p > 0.05) with DEET at all five concentrations on both insects.The contact toxicities of essential oils from five Artemisia species against L. bostrychophila and T. castaneum adults are listed in Table 3 and Table 4. Except for A. tanacetifolia, others all exhibited contact effects against L. bostrychophila. Among them, the A. ordosica essential oil possessed the most potent contact toxicity (LD50 = 52.11 μg/cm2), about three times less than the positive control, pyrethrins. Compared with A. ordosica, A. tangutica essential oil showed slightly weaker activity with an LD50 value of 70.48 μg/cm2. In addition, both A. sieversiana and A. dalai-lamae essential oils exhibited moderate toxicities with LD50 values of 195.51 and 115.94 μg/cm2, respectively, while for the insect of T. castaneum adults, A. tangutica possessed the most substantial toxicity with an LD50 of 17.42 μg/adult, followed by A. ordosica, A. dalai-lamae and A. tanacetifolia, with LD50 values of 21.68, 25.70 and 41.90 μg/adult, respectively.","The chemical composition of Artemisia species oils has high diversity. The oil has different protective effects due to various compositions, such as antibacterial activity, insecticidal effect, antiviral and repellent actions. Only essential oil components from A. sieversiana and A. ordosica have been reported before. Reports of the chemical constitutions of essential oils from these two kinds of Artemisia species indicated the high diversity caused by geographic locations (which may affect precipitation, temperature, edatope, etc.). The compositions of essential oils of A. sieversiana gathered from different regions of China in the flowering stage had a high level of variability. When sampling from Beijing, the essential oil contained eucalyptol (9.2%), geranyl butyrate (9.1%), camphor (7.9%), borneol (7.9%) and germacrene D (5.5%), whereas essential oils of A. sieversiana gathered from Tibet mainly consisted of α-bisabolol (34.47%), chamazulene (23.00%) and α-phellandrene (5.22%). In Ningxia, the oil was mainly chamazulene (29.61%), camphor (4.80%) and eucalyptol (4.32%).The essential oil extracted from A. ordosica collected from the southwestern boundary of Tengger Desert was mainly magnol (22.60%), trans-β-ocimene (11.60%), and acenaphthylene (11.00%). 2,5-Etheno[4.2.2]propella-3,7,9-triene (24.81%), trans-nerolidol (10.39%) and α-longipinene (8.82%) were the predominant compounds of the sample collected from the southeastern boundary of the Hopq desert. In the Mu Us desert, β-pinene (11.17%), limonene (11.41%) and capillene (9.46%) were the major components.In our tests, the main compounds of tested oils also were found in other Artemisia species. For example, camphor, linalool and 4-terpineol were the major compositions in A. haussknechtii, and spathulenol, β-elemene, germacrene D were found in A. campestris. Caryophyllene was the main compound in A. lavandulaefolia and A. rubripes oils. It has also been reported that changes in the composition of volatile oils can also occur during plant growth stages. For instance, monoterpenoids, the major composing components (69.5–77.7%) of Ocimum americanum oil, were found to be maximal (77.7%) in the vegetative growth stage followed in the seed setting period (76.8%) and full flowering stage (74.2%), with the minimum at the half-flowering stage (69.5%). Recently, thousands of plants have been deemed as potential sources of repellents. The repellent properties of essential oils from the genus Artemisia were also well documented. In our previous research, five Artemisia species, including A. anethoides, A. giraldii, A. roxburghiana and A. rubripes were evaluated for their repellent activities on T. castaneum. The result indicated that the five essential oils were effective in repelling T. castaneum, and the sequence of their activity was A. rubripes > A. anethoides > A. roxburghiana = A. sacrorum = DEET (the positive control) > A. giraldii (p > 0.05). In another previous research, polyacetylenes were isolated from the essential oil of A. ordosica aerial parts. Although with low relative content, the three tested polyacetylenes (capillene, capillin and cis-dehydromatricaria ester) were proved to possess fair repellent and fumigant activities against T. castaneum adults. Additionally, A. lavandulaefolia essential oil and its six constituents were tested on Lasioderma serricorne. At 2 h after exposure, the same level of repellency (p > 0.05) was observed at doses from 0.63 to 78.63 nL/cm2. In other reports, A. vulgaris essential oil presented high repellent activity against T. castaneum. The essential oil extracted from A. scoparia had more marked repellent activity on Sitophilus oryzae and T. castaneum than Callosobruchus maculatus, but as a whole, the oil strongly repelled each species of tested pests. Moreover, in our tests, the main constituents of the five Artemisia species were proved to have a repellent effect. For example, 3-carene had over 85% of PR values against L. bostrychophila and T. castaneum after 2 h exposure. Caryophyllene had the PR values of 82% and 98% against T. castaneum after 2 h and 4 h exposure, respectively. These major components were also confirmed to be toxic to other insects, such as Aedes aegypti, Semanstus japonicus and Lasioderma serricorne. Therefore, this study and the previous reports proved that essential oils from the genus Artemisia have great potential to be developed as good repellent agents against storage insects. The different toxicity effects could be found based on the LD50 values of five Artemisia species oils obtained in this study. The essential oils from A. ordosica and A. tangutica exhibited stronger contact toxicity than others against L. bostrychophila and T. castaneum. The essential oil of A. sieversiana possessed weak toxicity against L. bostrychophila with a LD50 value of 195.51 μg/cm2, and no insecticide effect was observed in tested concentrations to T. castaneum. In the previous report, A. sieversiana also possessed weak contact toxicity against Sitophilus zeamais adults with an LD50 value of 112.7 mg/adult. No significant correlation was observed when combined with the LD50 values of principal components and essential oils. This is considered to be related to the content of components and the synergistic or antagonistic effect between compounds. Pavela et al. (2010) estimated the fumigant toxicity against Spodoptera littoralis larvae of 15 pairs of binary mixtures. It showed that nine mixtures had a synergistic effect, five mixtures had an additive effect, and one mixture had an antagonistic effect. It was also identified that 138 synergistic/antagonistic effects were detected among 39 compounds in binary mixtures via topical application against Trichoplusia ni. So it may need further study to reveal the relationship between the insecticidal activities of different compounds.The mechanism of bio-action of essential oils was recorded. For contact toxicity, substances could permeate through the skin of insects to act on the insects. Some of the substances could cause neurological disorders, for example, the inhibition of the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is an important enzyme to regulate synaptic transmission. The inhibition of AChE could lead to hyperexcitation, causing locomotor behaviour alternation. High concentrations or combined use of substances may generate the knockdown effect, reflecting acute toxicity. These phenomena make us care about the safety of applying essential oils and plant-derived substances. Although the potential toxicity to mammals or cells of these five Artemisia species has not been studied yet, the safety evaluation of some other species in Artemisia has been recorded. The water extracts of A. dracunculus showed a maximum tolerated dose to rodents at over 200 mL of extract (1:10)/kg bw. Essential oil from A. nilagirica had a LD50 value of 7528.10 µL/kg for male mice. The essential oil of A. herba-alba showed no significant cytotoxicity in macrophages at the concentrations of 1.25 µL/mL and no significant cytotoxicity to microglial cells and keratinocytes at concentrations up to 0.32 µL/mL. Moreover, the safety of the major constituents, 1,8-cineole, camphor, 3-carene and caryophyllene, was evaluated. After acute oral administration of 1,8-cineole, the LD50 value was 3849 mg/kg, while no significant changes in body weight and relative organ weight were observed in the subacute toxicity study. The natural form of camphor was not toxic at 100 mg·kg·b.w.−1 to mice. For 3-carene, the exposure by inhalation at 0.0014 mg/day was believed to be safe, and it could cause eye irritation at about 2.39 mg/mL air. Caryophyllene was not considered as a skin sensitiser, and the TTC (threshold of toxicological concern) of inhalation exposure was 0.012 mg/day, which is 117 times lower than the Cramer Class I TTC. However, essential oils from some Artemisia species were confirm to have toxicity to human. For example, volatile oil extracted from A. argyi could cause hepatocellular harm to cause liver injury. Although there was no direct evidence that these five essential oils are safe enough for use, combined with the toxicity of other essential oils from Artemisia and the major constituents, it can be assumed that these essential oils are at lower concentrations of safe use as insecticides.","The chemical composition, repellent activity and contact toxicity of five Artemisia species (A. dalai-lamae, A. tangutica, A. sieversiana, A. tanacetifolia and A. ordosica) essential oils extracted by hydrodistillation were compared by PCA and HCA. All the oils showed obvious repellent activity against both insects in repellent tests. As for contact toxicity, the obtained values of LD50 demonstrated that several of the evaluated essential oils possessed toxic effects on L. bostrychophila and T. castaneum adults. Among these oils, A. ordosica essential oil possessed the most potent contact toxicity (LD50 = 52.11 μg/cm2) against L. bostrychophila, and A. tangutica essential oil exhibited the most substantial toxicity (LD50 = 17.42 μg/adult) against T. castaneum. Hence, the results suggest that the above five Artemisia species have the potential to be further exploited as repellent and insecticide agents against storage pests."
39,TA050516,10.3390/md16030076,Comparative Analysis of Culture Conditions for the Optimization of CarotenoidProduction in Several Strains of the Picoeukaryote Ostreococcus.,"Microalgae are promising sources for the sustainable production of compounds ofinterest for biotechnologies. Compared to higher plants, microalgae have a fastergrowth rate and can be grown in industrial photobioreactors. The microalgaebiomass contains specific metabolites of high added value for biotechnology suchas lipids, polysaccharides or carotenoid pigments. Studying carotenogenesis isimportant for deciphering the mechanisms of adaptation to stress tolerance aswell as for biotechnological production. In recent years, the picoeukaryoteOstreococcustauri has emerged as a model organism thanks to the development ofpowerful genetic tools. Several strains of Ostreococcus isolated from differentenvironments have been characterized with respect to light response or ironrequirement. We have compared the carotenoid contents and growth rates of strainsof Ostreococcus (OTTH595, RCC802 and RCC809) under a wide range of light,salinity and temperature conditions. Carotenoid profiles and productivitiesvaried in a strain-specific and stress-dependent manner. Our results alsoillustrate that phylogenetically related microalgal strains originating fromdifferent ecological niches present specific interests for the production ofspecific molecules under controlled culture conditions.","Guyon, Jean-Baptiste, Vergé, Valérie, Schatt, Philippe, Lozano, Jean-Claude, Liennard, Marion, Bouget, François-Yves",2018,Marine drugs,2,False,False,True,"Microalgae are known to produce molecules of interest for nutraceutic, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and carotenoids. The success of microalgae-derived production of compounds of interest at industrial scale is due to a number of key factors, the rapid accumulation in biomass being often considered one of the most important. Microalgae are a major source of non-enzymatic antioxidants, among which carotenoids are predominant. Marine microalgae are exposed to dramatic fluctuations in light intensity depending on weather conditions resulting from either reduced solar irradiation or mixing of the water column. Excess light energy damages the photosynthetic machinery, whereas insufficient light supply limits photosynthesis. Carotenoids are keys to the regulation of light input to the photosynthetic apparatus. They serve as accessory pigments to increase the capture of photons that are transferred to chlorophyll molecules, as well as to absorb photon excess under high light in order to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from photo-damage.Carotenoids, which are among the most potent antioxydants, have received much attention as potential anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory agents. Several carotenoids are produced industrially for their antioxidant properties and/or as staining agents in aquaculture. Astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis and Chlorella zofigiensis was shown to significantly reduce the presence of free radicals and thus counteract oxidative stress. Astaxanthin also has potential in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. β-carotene, which accumulates in Dunaliella salina at up to 14% dry weight, is a vitamin A precursor in humans. Molecules derived from β-carotene, like lutein and violaxanthin, have anti-inflammatory properties. Lutein is also used in eye therapies; in particular to treat age-related macular degeneration. Although carotenoid activities rely mainly on their antioxidant properties, the diversity of their chemical structures, with more than 700 reported molecules, opens a vast field of investigation and potential applications for these molecules.The production of carotenoids at an industrial scale requires: (i) the optimization of culture conditions for carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation and (ii) the selection of overproducing strains. Various stresses induce carotenoid accumulation. Cordero et al. (2012) demonstrated that the regulation of the carotenogenic pathway of Chlorella zofingiensis was influenced by light and nitrogen. Both light and nitrogen-starvation stress enhance the accumulation of β-carotenoid, such as astaxanthin, canthaxanthin or zeaxanthin. This stress, however, had also an antagonistic effect on the production of α-carotenoids. Temperature stress of 40 °C was also shown to induce β-carotene accumulation up to 5% of dry weight in Tetraselmis sp.. Finally, high salinity induces lipid and carotenoid production in Chlorella zofingiensis but reduces growth rates, leading to biomass decrease.Metabolic engineering provides an alternative for selecting strains that overproduce carotenoids of interest. A zeaxanthin over-expressing strain was obtained by mutagenesis in Dunaliella. Phytoene synthase (psy) is a key enzyme involved in the first step of carotenoid synthesis. The over-expression of Chlorella psy enhances the accumulation of violaxanthin and lutein in Chlamydomonas and of β-carotene in Scenedesmus sp.. The heterologous expression of the lycopene β-cyclase/lycopene ε-cyclase/light-harvesting complex-fusion protein from the green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus allowed the modulation of the ratio between α- and β-pathways in bacteria. This enzyme may, therefore, be a target of interest for metabolic engineering of carotenoid synthesis in Ostreococcus cells.The genus Ostreococcus (Mamiellophyceae) was originally discovered in the Thau lagoon and described as the smallest free-living eukaryotes. Since the early sequencing of the Ostreococcus tauri OTTH595 strain, genetic transformation was implemented including gene targeting by homologous recombination. Ostreoccocus has become a model organism to address biological questions such as circadian clock architecture, cell-cycle regulation or the regulation of iron homeostasis. Picophytoplanktonic eukaryotes belonging to Mamiellophyceae (Ostreococcus, Micromonas and Bathycoccus), have a worldwide distribution representing the 4th most abundant group in sequence numbers in the TARA Ocean Cruise. Several strains of Ostreococcus have been sequenced and comparative analysis has revealed the existence of “strains or ecotypes”, which are adapted to specific ecological niches with respect to light intensity (depth) or iron requirements.Ostreococcus cells present several traits of interest as a source of high added-value molecules for biotechnologies. In addition to a fast growing rate, this microalga contains high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated omega fatty acids such as DHA. Ostreococcus cells are also a rich source of carotenoids including those that are widely distributed such as violaxanthin, antheraxantin or zeaxanthin, or Mamiellophyceae-specific carotenoids such as micromonal, uriolide or prasinoxanthin.We have studied the potential of three Ostreococcus strains (OTTH595, RCC809 and RCC802) to produce specific carotenoids in response to light, temperature and salinity stress in batch conditions. Growth rates were also determined to evaluate the potential of these strains to produce carotenoids in continuous culture maintained in an exponential phase of growth.","Microalgal strains of Ostreococcus tauri (OTTH595), Ostreococcus lucimarinus (RCC802) and Ostreococcus sp. (RCC809) were obtained from Roscoff culture collection. The strains were cultivated in 100 mL flasks or 96-deep well plates (Nunc, Perki Elmer, Hessen, Germany), in filtered artificial seawater (24.55 g·L−1 NaCl, 0.75 g·L−1 KCl, 4.07 g·L−1 MgCl2·6H2O, 1.47 g·L−1 CaCl2·2H2O, 6.04 g·L−1 MgSO4·7H2O, 0.21 g·L−1 NaHCO3, 0.138 g·L−1 NaH2PO4 and 0.75 g·L−1 NaNO3) supplemented with trace metals and vitamins. Cultures were maintained under constant gentle agitation at 20 °C in an orbital platform shaker (Heidoph shaker and mixer unimax 1010) under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Realistic sunlight irradiation curves were applied during the light period with a maximum of 150 µmol quanta m−2·s−1 at solar noon in temperature-controlled incubators (Panasomic MIR-154-PE). For temperature, light and salinity experiments, algal cells inoculated in triplicate at 1 million cells·mL−1 in 50 mL flasks or deep well microplates (1.5 mL wells) were first acclimated for 7 days in the tested condition. Cells were refreshed at 1 million cells·mL−1 in deep wells for growth rate experiments or 50 mL flasks for carotenoid analysis. Experiments were first performed to explore growth rates under different salinities (15–60 g·L−1 of NaCl), temperature (12–30 °C) and light intensities (50–1200 µmol quanta m−2·s−1).For growth experiments, all samples from biological triplicate (20 µL) were fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldricht, St Louis, MO, USA) for 15 min at room temperature, before being frozen on dry ice. Samples were stored at −20 °C until cell counting. The cell number was determined using a BD accury C6 flow cytometer. The growth rate was determined as described below.Based on growth rates the following conditions were selected for carotenoid analysis. For light experiments, 12 h light:12 h dark cycles were applied with light intensities at solar noon of 50 µmol quanta m−2·s−1 for low light (LL) , 150 µmol quanta m−2·s−1 for standard light, 800 µmol quanta m−2·s−1 (HL) and 1200 µmol quanta m−2·s−1 (HL+) for high light depending on the light tolerance of the strain. For temperature experiments, temperature of 12 °C (LT−), 15 °C (LT), 27.5 °C (HT) and 30 °C (HT+) were used depending on the strain tolerance. For salinity experiments, conditions of either low salinity (15 g·L−1 of NaCl) of high salinity of 50 g·L−1 NaCl (HS50) or 60 g·L−1 NaCl (HS60) depending on the strain tolerance. At the end of the culture, the 50 mL of culture was filtered onto a cellulose membrane GF/F 25 mm, (pore size 0.7 µm filters; Dominique Dutscher: 036334B) in darkness. Then filters were carefully dried to remove artificial sea water (ASW) before being transferred to cryotubes that were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stores at −80 °C prior to carotenoid analysis. Cells of each sample were also fixed for counting by flow cytometry.The carotenoids on the GF/F filters were extracted at −20 °C in 3 mL methanol 100% and disrupted by sonication for 2 h. Separation and identification of the carotenoids were carried out using HPLC 1200 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The methanol extract was mixed (1:1) with a buffer solution tetra-butylammonium acetate (TBAA) 28 mM and then, injected onto a narrow reversed-phase C8 Zorbax Eclipse XDB column (3 × 150 mm; 3.5 μm particle size) which was maintained at 60 °C. Elution of carotenoids was achieved within 28 min on a gradient between a solution (A) of TBAA 28 mM: methanol (30:70; v:v) and a solution (B) of 100% methanol according to the following program: (t (min); %B; %A), (0; 10; 90), (25; 95; 5), (28; 95; 5). Pigments were detected using a diode array detector, at 450 nm for carotenoids and 667 nm for chlorophyll a and its derivatives. Peak assignments and quantization were undertaken using carotenoid standards. Chemicals and reagents of HPLC grade were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Carotenoid content normalized to the cell number (determined by flow cytometry) was expressed in pg·g·L−1·cell−1. The productivity in 7-day batch culture (Pbatch) corresponding to the concentration of carotenoids produced by day was expressed in µg·L−1·d−1.For each culture condition the cell number was determined by flow cytometry daily, for a week. The growth rate in batch culture can be determined as Ln(N)/dt, where N is the cell concentration per mL (cells·mL−1) and T the time (days). The maximal growth rate (µmax) was determined on a graph expressing the neperian logarithm of cell concentration as a function of time of culture. µmax corresponded to the slope of the linear part of the growth curve (i.e., excluding the lag phase and the stationary phase). Nfmax is number of cells at end of exponential growth phase; N0 is number of cells inoculated; T is the time (days) at the end of exponential growth phase.In our batch conditions, cells were either at the end of the exponential phase of in the exponential phase, depending on the stress applied. To estimate the theoretical maximal cell number in continuous culture in which cells are maintained in the exponential phase of growth all the time (chemostat). We used the following equation:Tbatch is the duration of the batch culture (7 days in our experiments).It follows that the theoretical maximal carotenoid productivity in continuous culture maintained in the exponential phase of growth (Pmax) is:Nf is the number of cells obtained at the end of the batch culture, Pbatch is carotenoid productivity in the batch determined experimentally.Analyses were performed in triplicate for each microalgae sample (n = 3). Means and standard deviations of the raw data and regression analysis of calibration samples were carried out using R statistic software. A test of normality, Shapiro–Wilkinson, (p > 0.05) followed by one way analysis of t-test variance was used to compare stressed conditions to the standard. Values were considered to be statistically significant when p < 0.05.Multivariate redundant analyses (RDA) were conducted using the Vegan package to compare carotenoid productivities under different stress conditions. Analysis of similarity (ADONIS) was performed to compare groups. A resemblance matrix was built up based on pairwise Bray–Curtis distances. Similarity percentages (SIMPER), based on a non-parametric permutation procedure, were used to determine the contribution of each factor (i.e., each carotenoid) to the dissimilarities between groups.","Three Ostreococcus strains were selected for comparative analysis of carotenoid production under light, temperature or salinity stress conditions (Table 1). Two strains (RCC802, RCC809) are oceanic; the third strain is the original strain of Ostreococcus (Ostreococcus tauri, OTTH595) that was isolated from the Thau Lagoon. Both RCC802 (Mediterranean) and RCC809 (Atlantic tropical) come from deep environments where light is limited; RCC809 was described as a low-light strain. Based on sequence homology RCC802 is an Ostreococcus lucimarinus strain, a species described as “high-light adapted”. These three strains differ in term of temperature niches. The Thau lagoon (OTTH595) is a shallow environment displaying dramatic fluctuation in temperature over the year (4 °C to 30 °C) whereas RCC802 and RCC809 were isolated from the environment where the temperature is fairly stable over the year. Similarly, the salinity of the Thau lagoon is subject to large variations because of flood events and strong evaporation in summer. It should be noted also that the three strains belong to different phylogenetic clades (A, B and C).We first determined the ability of Ostreococcus strains to survive and grow in response to changes in light, salinity and temperature conditions (Table 2). In all experiments cultures cells were exposed to 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, the light period mimicking realistic solar curves of irradiation (see Material and Methods). The standard light condition corresponded to a light intensity of 150 μmol quanta m−2·s−1, at solar noon, temperature of 20 °C and salinity of 36 g·L−1. Cultures were acclimated for one week in each light/temperature conditions and refreshed before measuring the growth rate. Depending on the stress applied, differences were observed between the three strains. While both OTTH595 and RCC809 grew between 12 °C and 32 °C, RCC802 displayed lower temperature preferences between 10 °C and 27.5 °C. OTTH595, unlike RCC802 and RCC809, grew under low salinities (7.5 g·L−1 of NaCl), while RCC802 did not survive at salinities below 15 g·L−1 of NaCl. All three strains tolerated high salinities of 65 g·L−1 of NaCl. Under low light (50 μmol quanta m−2·s−1) growth was detected only in OTTH595. All strains except RCC802 were able to grow at light intensities up to 1500 μmol quanta m−2·s−1 at solar noon. The highest specific growth rates were observed under the standard light conditions for OTTH595 (1.66 d−1), RCC809 (1.64 d−1) and RCC802 (1.52 d−1).Cultures were grown in 50 mL batches, as described in the above section, under various conditions. Carotenoids were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Table 3). In the standard culture condition, RCC809 had the highest content of total carotenoid (250.5 µg·L−1). In OTTH595, the highest concentrations were found under high temperature (279 µg·L−1), high light (266.2 µg·L−1), and low salinity (265.4 µg·L−1) and the lowest content was detected under low light (33.3 µg·L−1) and low temperature (18.5 µg·L−1) with a more than 15-fold reduction between the high-temperature and low-temperature conditions. In RCC802, the highest concentration of carotenoids was obtained at low salinity (431.1 µg·L−1). We also estimated the concentration of carotenoids per cell to take into account the differences in growth rates between stress conditions (Table 3). The highest cellular concentrations of total carotenoids were observed at 27.5 °C for OTTH595 (11.09 pg·cell−1) and at 30 °C for RCC809 (7.70 pg·cell−1), but for this latter strain this was not significantly higher than in the standard condition (6.23 pg·cell−1) in a Student’s t-test (p-value < 0.05). The highest cellular concentration of carotenoids occurred under low salinity in RCC802, (9.27 pg·cell−1) corresponding to a 2-fold increased compared to standard conditions.The relative concentrations of α- and β-carotenoids are shown in Figure S1. The β-carotenoid relative content increased and conversely the α-carotenoid relative content decreased under high light irradiances (Figure S1A). The increase of β-carotenoid was more pronounced in OTTH595 and RCC809 (from 39% to 52% and from 40% to 51%, respectively) than in RCC802 (from 41% to 45%). High or low salinity had either a moderate effect on the relative content in α- and β-carotenoids in OTTH595 or no significant effect in RCC809, but low salinity favored the α-pathway in RCC802 (Figure S1B). An increase in temperature from 12 °C to 30 °C had similar effects on α- vs β-carotenoids content for OTTH595 and RCC802 with a decrease of the β-pathway (from 39% to 34% in OTTH595 between 12 °C and 30 °C and from 41% to 39% in RCC802 between 12 °C and 27.5 °C) relative to the α-pathway increase (Figure S1C).We investigated the effect of light intensity on the carotenoid profiles inferred from HPLC analysis (Figure 1). Ten carotenoids were identified, in all three strains. Prasinoxanthin was the most abundant molecule, representing between 30% and 35% of total carotenoid content. Increasing light intensity resulted in a dramatic accumulation of xanthophylls, including violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin, in the three strains. This changes between standard light and high light were more pronounced for violaxanthin in RCC809 (from 13% to 23% of total carotenoid) and for antheraxanthin in OTTH595, (from 0.62% to 7.22% of total carotenoid). Zeaxanthin and lutein also increased in response to light in these two strains but not in RCC802. Finally the xanthophyll neoxanthin did not change in response to light in any of the strains.Temperature and salinity had almost no impact on carotenoid profiles in batch cultures (Figures S2 and S3). Only, violaxanthin content decreased slightly with temperature level in all the strains. When looking at the cellular content, prasinoxanthin was the most abundant carotenoid in all strains, reaching under high temperature up to 2.36 pg·cell−1 and 2.51 pg·cell−1 in OTTH595 and RCC809, respectively, and 3.19 pg·cell−1 under low salinity in RCC802 (Table S3). Violaxanthin increased strongly in response to high light, high temperature and low salinity in OTTH595 (0.67, 0.66 and 0.70 pg·cell−1, respectively) but it was maximal only under low salinity in RCC802 (1.21 pg·cell−1) and it remained fairly constant under all stress conditions in RCC809. Under high light, antheraxanthin levels were 25 fold higher in OTTH595 (0.25 pg·cell−1) compared to standard conditions, but its level changed only by 2 fold in RCC802 and RCC809 (0.13 pg·cell−1 and 0.07 pg·cell−1, respectively).The productivity of each carotenoid was determined in batch cultures after 7 days, i.e., either during or at the end of the exponential phase of growth depending on the stress applied. To compare carotenoid profiles in the three strains under various stress conditions, a multivariate analysis was performed (Figure 2). The first component accounted for most of the variability observed under the different stress conditions (92.99% for OTTH595, 87.69% for RCC809 and 97.91% for RCC802). Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that prasinoxanthin was the main carotenoid influencing group separation along the first component. Together the first and the second component accounted for 99% of the observed variability. Violaxanthin and to some extent antheraxanthin influenced the separation of samples by the second component, although this was less pronounced for RCC802. Analysis of variance using distance matrices (ADONIS) was performed to create a matrix of similarity to compare the different groups corresponding to biological triplicates of each strain under specific stress conditions. Most groups were statistically different in similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis (p-value < 0.001). However differences were noted between the different strains depending on the stress condition applied. High temperature and low salinity were the main parameters influencing carotenoid productivity in OTTH595 (Figure 2A), and in RCC802 (Figure 2C), respectively, but the productivity was not impacted by stress in RCC809 (Figure 2B). In contrast, high light influenced violaxanthin productivity in all strains, and antheraxanthin in OTTH595.The productivities of 148 carotenoids of 240 quantified (24 samples) were found to be significantly different from the control (p-value ≤ 0.05 in a paired parametric Shapiro–Wilk t-test). Under standard culture conditions, the prasinoxanthin productivity in the batch culture was 7.74 µg·L−1·d−1; 11.19 µg·L−1·d−1 and 7.09 µg·L−1·d−1 for OTTH595, RCC809 and RCC802, respectively. Under specific stress conditions, significant increases were observed, reaching up to 12.35 µg·L−1·d−1 at high temperature for OTTH595 and 21.15 µg·L−1·d−1 at low salinity for RCC802, These results confirmed that low salinity and high temperature stimulate prasinoxanthin production in RCC802 and OTTH595, respectively (Table S1). Similarly, violaxanthin productivity increased in response to high light conditions for the three strains. Noteworthy antheraxanthin productivity was strongly enhanced under high light conditions (2.72 µg·L−1·d−1) in OTTH595 compared to control condition (0.16 µg·L−1·d−1).We next estimated the theoretical maximal productivity in the exponential phase of culture based on growth rate in each stress condition, as determined earlier (Table S2). Multivariate RDA analysis was performed to compare the different conditions (Figure 3). Under batch conditions, prasinoxanthin and violaxanthin/antheraxanthin were the main pigment correlated to the variability of the first and second component, respectively. Carotenoid productivities, in particular prasinoxanthin, were influenced by high light, in OTTH595 (Figure 3A), and they were not affected much by stress in RCC809 (Figure 3B). In RCC802, the productivity was influenced by high light and to some extent by low salinity (Figure 3C).In agreement with these results, we noted in RCC802 a maximal productivity of prasinoxanthin under standard conditions (55.08 µg·L−1·d−1) and RCC809 (52.24 µg·L−1·d−1), respectively, and under high light in OTTH595 (100.77 µg·L−1·d−1) (Table S2). Violaxanthin productivity reached up to 73.81 µg·L−1·d−1 in OTTH595 when exposed to high light, while in RCC802 and RCC809 the maximal productivity was higher under standard conditions (23.55 and 28.09 µg·L−1·d−1, respectively). Antheraxanthin maximal productivity (27.91 µg·L−1·d−1.) was the highest in OTTH595 (compared to 0.57 and 2.82 µg·L−1·d−1 maximal productivities in RCC809 and RCC802, respectively).RDA was also performed for the three strains, considering α- and β-carotenoids globally (Figure S4). The α-pathway influenced the variability of the first component while the β-pathway influenced the second component also. The low salinity had a moderate impact on the α-carotenoid productivity in RCC802 and the high light strongly influenced the α- and β-pathway in OTTH595, in particular when considering the maximal productivity (Figure S4).Figure 4 summarizes the optimal conditions for the production of the main carotenoids either in batch or extrapolated under the exponential phase condition. The low salinity condition was optimal for the maximal production of prasinoxanthin in RCC802 in the batch. The high light condition, in contrast, was more favorable for prasinoxanthin maximal production in OTTH595. Violaxanthin productivity was highest under high light and low salinity in RCC802 in batch conditions. The theoretical maximal productivity for violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin + lutein, however, was the highest in OTTH595 exposed to high light.","In this study we compared the potential of three strains of the genus Ostreococcus to produce carotenoids under a wide range of light, salinity and stress conditions. Carotenoid profiles similar to those previously described were detected by HPLC. Ten pigments were resolved including some that were specific such as prasinoxanthin, uriolide, micromonal and one unknown, as well as more common carotenoids such violaxanthin, antheraxantin, zeaxanthin + lutein, neoxanthin, dihydrolutein and α/β carotene. Under our standard batch conditions of light (150 μmol quanta m−2·s−1, temperature (20 °C) and salinity (36 g·L−1 of NaCl) the cellular concentrations of total carotenoid were variable between strains (4.62, 2.01 and 6.24 pg·cell−1 for RCC802, OTTH595 and RCC809, respectively). The carotenoid productivities, however, were similar in 7-day batch culture for, RCC802, OTTH595 and RCC809 (167.613 µg·L−1, 179.44 µg·L−1, 250.50 µg·L−1, respectively) because of differences in growth rates between the three strains (Table 2).We observed that the carotenoid content is modulated quantitatively and qualitatively by abiotic stresses with strain-specific responses. The differential effect of high light stress was noted between the strains with respect to the quantitative and qualitative content of the carotenoids (Figure 2, Table 3 and Table S3). In OTTH595, a 7-fold induction was observed in total cellular carotenoid content between low light and high light, but in other strains the total cellular content of carotenoids decreased under high light (Table 3). Higher growth rates were also observed under high light in OTTH595. As a result, despite cellular carotenoid content being lower under high light (3.52 pg·cell−1) than under high temperature (11.09 pg·cell−1), production in 7-day batches were almost equivalent between the two conditions (266.256 µg·L−1 vs. 278.981 µg·L−1). OTTH595 is a lagoon strain that was described as a high-light “ecotype”, whereas RCC809 and RCC802 are deep strains and considered low-light ecotypes. These differences in light niches may account for the differences observed in the light-dependent regulation of carotenoid synthesis. Carotenoids are located within the thylakoid membrane inside the chloroplast where they are associated with protein-like light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) which absorb light and transfer its energy to chlorophyll, triggering the photochemical events of photosynthesis. Xanthophylls play an important role in the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against photo-oxidative damage. The conversion of violaxanthin into zeaxanthin, in the violaxanthin cycle, is a well-known mechanism involved in photoprotection. Violaxanthin dissipates the excess of PSII excitation energy into heat through non-photochemical quenching. We were not able to quantify zeaxanthin, since lutein and zeaxanthin cooeluted in our HPLC analysis, as previously described. Antheraxanthin is an intermediate in the violaxanthin cycle. In OTTH595, violaxanthin increased in response to high light by a two-fold factor (Table S3). Differences in the levels of antheraxanthin were observed between low and high light, with a 25-fold induction in OTTH595 but only a 2-fold induction in the two other strains. The conversion of antheraxanthin into zeaxanthin is, therefore, likely to be less efficient in OTTH595. Although the biological meaning of antheraxantin accumulation in OTTH595 under high light is not clear, our observation suggests that Ostreococcus tauri could be an interesting source of antheraxanthin as well as zeaxanthin + lutein (Figure 4).High temperature was the major factor enhancing carotenoid content in OTTH595 with 11.09 pg·cell−1, while low salinity strongly stimulated carotenoid content in RCC802 (9.26 pg·cell−1). These results suggest that carotenoids could contribute to the adaptation of strains to specific environmental niches. RCC802, for example, does not grow below salinities of 15 g·L−1 NaCl and accumulates high amounts of carotenoids under this low-salinity condition. The induction of carotenogenesis by salinity has been documented in other microalgae such as Haemotococcus or Dunaliella. Carotenoid accumulation, in contrast, is enhanced under high temperature in OTTH595, a strain that was isolated from the Thau Lagoon, an environment marked by large temperature fluctuations (Table 3 and Table S3). This effect of temperature has been reported in other microalgae strains such as Chlorella vulgaris. Prasinoxanthin, the main carotenoid pigment in Prasinophyceae, accounted the most for the increased carotenoid productivity in response to low-salinity and high-temperature stress in RCC802 and OTTH595 (Figure 2). It should be noted, however, that under these conditions the cellular content of all carotenoids increased (Table S3). No specific induction of the β-pathway, in particular xanthophylls, was observed, unlike under high light. This suggests that the primary function of carotenoids under these salinity and temperature conditions is not photoprotection. The global induction of carotenoids in RCC802 and OTTH595 in response to low salinity and high temperature suggest that their accumulation is, rather, a response to oxidative stress arising from either temperature or osmotic stress. Such an induction of carotenogenesis, in particular lutein, is triggered in Muriellopsis sp. by reactive oxygen species induced by high temperature.Ostreococcus strains contain specific Prasinophyceae-specific carotenoids such as prasinoxanthin, micromonal or uriolide and one unknown molecule representing more than 50% of total carotenoids, for which no biological activity have been described. As carotenoids are strong antioxidants, most of them reduce oxidative stress associated with diseases such as diabetes, cancer and eye pathologies. Microalgal carotenoids including fucoxanthin, cantaraxanthin or astaxantin have anti-proliferating capacity. Astaxanthin, in particular, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of bladder, colon or leukemia cells. It would be of great interest to test the activity of Ostreococcus prasinoxanthin, micromonal or uriolide. Several carotenoids of the beta family including zeaxanthin, lutein, or violaxanthin exhibit anti-inflammatory activities. Under high light stress, OTTH595 accumulates up to around 20% of violaxanthin and OTTH595 up to 7% of antheraxanthin, but antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin + lutein levels remained low in RCC809 (3.7% and 6%). Comparison of the activities of carotenoid extracts of the different strains grown under specific condition (e.g., OTTH595 and RCC809 under high light) could give insights into the biological activity of these carotenoid extracts.In our experiments, carotenoids were quantified at the end of exponential phase. Under these conditions RCC802 appeared to be the most interesting strain for the production of total carotenoids. Extrapolation of productivities based on growth rates in the exponential phase, however, suggest that OTTH595 could potentially produce more carotenoids under high light because of higher growth rates. In the future, it would be interesting to combine stresses such as high light and salinity to improve carotenoid productivity. The effect of nitrogen starvation could also be tested alone or in combination with the other stresses. Considering industrial production of carotenoids in industrial photobioreactors exposed to natural sunlight, our results suggest that OTTH595 would be the most interesting strain, in particular in summer when light intensity and temperature are high. In winter, however, when light intensity is reduced, RCC809 or RCC802 under low salinity conditions would be less expensive to produce.",We have identified 10 carotenoids in the three Ostreococcus strains. The results of our study highlight the potential of related strains originating from different environmental niches to obtain carotenoid content that is qualitatively and quantitatively different depending on the stress applied. They also illustrate that the growth rate in the exponential phase should be taken into account in order to extrapolate the strain’s ability to produce carotenoids in continuous culture for future large-scale production in a photobioreactor.
40,TA044129,10.1080/21655979.2022.2061302,Protective effects of asiaticoside on renal ischemia reperfusion injury in vivoand in vitro.,"Ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) is the main causes of acute kidney injury(AKI), which is a global health concern. Evidence suggests that asiaticosideplays vital roles on anti-inflammatory and, anti-kidney fibrosis effects, andpromotes tissue repair. However, the effects of asiaticoside on AKI caused byischemia-reperfusion have not been well defined. Herein, we explored theprotective effect of asiaticoside on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)using in vivo and in vitro studies, and elucidated the potential mechanism ofasiaticoside-mediated repair. Results showed that asiaticoside attenuated thelevels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) in the IRI model.Meanwhile, asiaticoside reduced the secretion of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α, butincreased IL-10 secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Treating Raw264.7 cellswith lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced an inflammatory response, but theLPS-induced effects were attenuated after administering asiaticoside.Furthermore, asiaticoside significantly inhibited the expression of inducibleNitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) and promoted the expression of Arginase1 induced byLPS, which are the polarization marker proteins. In conclusion, this study showsthat asiaticoside possesses protective action in AKI after ischemia-reperfusion,due to the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and promoting transformation ofmacrophages from M1 type to M2 type.","Tang, Shengjie, Xie, Xiangcheng, Wang, Ming, Yang, Lili, Wei, Wei",2022,Bioengineered,2,False,False,True,"Acute kidney injury (AKI), a common clinical syndrome defined by an abrupt decline in renal excretory function, has an incidence rate of about 5–15% in hospitalized patients. Evidence suggests that even mild AKI is associated with a reduction in long-term survival. This is because the onset of AKI can lead to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the major causes of AKI, which induces microvasculature alterations, robust inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and necrosis. However, the mechanism that regulates the repair process after AKI has not yet been fully elucidated.Previous studies have suggested that inflammatory cascades of chemokines AND cytokines, the infiltration of macrophages and stress oxidative processes modulate the injury and repair stage of AKI. It has also been reported that macrophages, as innate immune cells, have pathogenic roles in AKI. Notably, mature macrophages respond to environmental signals through two polarization programs: classically activated macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated ones (M2). These two programs can be activated or inhibited by various cytokines, including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Interleukin-33 (IL-33). Macrophages play an essential role in driving the progression or repair of IRI, depending on their activation stage and phenotype.Asiaticoside, a traditional Chinese medicine, is one of the primary active compounds derived from Centella asiatica (L.) Urban. Previous studies have revealed that asiaticoside has numerous beneficial effect, including anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic, osteoclastogenesis, and immunoregulation effects. Moreover, asiaticoside plays a critical role in chronic renal fibrosis, podocyte damage and diabetic nephropathy by regulating the expression of cytokines and the renal immune response.However, few studies have evaluated the effects of asiaticoside on acute kidney injury.This study aims to investigate the protective role of asiaticoside on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in IRI model mice and its regulation of macrophage polarization in LPS-treated mouse macrophage cell line. In the present study, we hypothesize that asiaticoside protected kidney from IRI, which may be because of the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and promoting transformation of macrophages from M1 type to M2 type.","Asiaticoside (purity, ≥ 98%)was purchased from Nakeli biotech, Chengdu, China, whereas LPS was obtained from Sigma Aldrich, USA. ELISA kits for IL-1β (cat.no. PI301), IL-6 (cat.no. PI326), Interleukin-10 (IL-10) (cat.no. PI523), and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) (cat.no. PT512) were purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China. Anti- iNOS (ab178945) and GAPDH (ab9485) were all obtained from Abcam, USA. Anti- Arginase1 (DF6657) and Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) HRP (S0001) were procured from Affinity-Antibody, USA. F4/80 (71,299) and Anti-rat IgG (H + L), (Alexa Fluor® 488 Conjugate, 4416) were got from Cell Signaling Technology (CST), USA.RAW264.7, a mouse macrophage cell line (Procell Life Science&Technology Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China), was cultured in DMEM high-glucose medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2.6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. The mice were placed at 24 ± 0.5°C, 12/12 h light/dark cycle. All animal texting procedures were approved by Zhejiang University Animal Care and Use Committee.Acute ischemic-reperfusion kidney injury (IRI) was induced in both kidneys as previously reported. Briefly, 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg body weight), followed by an incision, 1–5 cm long, at the back of the mouse. Next, both renal pedicles were clamped for 25 min. Notably, mice in the Sham groups underwent the same surgical procedure but without clamping of kidney pedicles. IRI mice were randomly divided into a low dose group (20 mg/kg), a medium dose group (40 mg/kg) and a high dose group (60 mg/kg). Saline or asiaticoside were administered via intraperitoneal injection after reperfusion for 6 h. Next, the above drugs were given once a day until the detection time (0, 1d, 3d and 7d). Blood samples were obtained after anesthesia, allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C to obtain serum. The kidney tissue was collected after anesthesia, followed by storing at −80°C. These samples were collected at the detection time for ELISA and biochemical analyses.Blood was centrifuged to obtain serum, followed by storing at −80°C until further analysis. The levels of BUN and Scr were determined using a biochemistry automatically analyzer (Hitachi 7020, Japan).RAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS (100 μg/ml) or LPS (100 μg/ml) + asiaticoside (100 μM) for 48 h. Next, cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 20 min at 4°C to extract total protein. Equal amounts (40 µg) of protein lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS solution containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20, membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies (all 1:1000) at 4°C overnight. On the next day, membranes were washed and incubated with a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000) at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing, the protein bands were visualized by electrochemiluminescence (FD8030, FDBio Science, China).RAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS (100 μg/ml) or LPS (100 μg/ml) + asiaticoside (10, 25, 50, 100 μM) for 48 h, followed by collection of cell supernatants. Levels of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF-α were then determined using ELISA kits (Beyotime, Shanghai, China).For immunofluorescence, formalin-fixed slides were deparaffinized and antigen retrieval was performed by microwave oven heating. Sections were blocked with goat serum for 30 min in room temperature. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies (F4/80) overnight at 4  C. Secondary antibody (Anti-rat IgG (H + L)) was applied for 1 h at 37°C, following by DAPI for 5 min. Immunofluorescence was assessed using an Olympus BX53/DP80 microscope (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku, Japan).All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0 software. All experiments were performed in triplicate and data were presented as means ± standard deviations. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare multiple groups, whereas Student’s t test was used to compare two groups. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.","Our study explored the effects of asiaticoside on renal IRI and its underlying mechanism, and found that asiaticoside protected the kidney injury mediated by IRI. The protective effect was related to the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and transformed M1 and M2 marker expressions of Raw264.7 cells.An ischemic renal injury mouse model was established by clamping the bilateral renal pedicle for 25 min. Results showed that BUN and Scr levels were significantly increased in IRI groups at day 1 compared to the Sham group (Figure 1(a, b)), indicating that the IRI model mice were successfully established. Next, IRI mice were administered with saline or different doses of asiaticoside to explore the effects of asiaticoside. We found that the levels of BUN and Scr were almost recovered within 48 h in the asiaticoside-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1(a, b)). Collectively, these findings indicated that asiaticoside can promote renal function in IRI mice. To investigate the functions of asiaticoside on the inflammatory response in IRI mice, we examined the inflammatory cytokine expressions using ELISA. Results indicated that renal ischemia-reperfusion injury significantly elevated the levels of IL-1β (Figure 2(a)), IL-6 (Figure 2(b)), TNF-α (Figure 2(c)), and IL-10 (Figure 2(d)) in the kidney compared to Sham groups. After asiaticoside intervention, the levels of IL-1β (Figure 2(a)), IL-6 (Figure 2(b)), and TNF-α (Figure 2(c)) were obviously alleviated. However, asiaticoside treatment further enhanced the expression of IL-10 (Figure 2(d)) induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury. The effect of asiaticoside on the infiltration of macrophages in kidney tissue of IRI model mice was detected by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 3). The fluorescence distribution of F4/80 in the kidney tissue of IRI model mice was significantly enhanced compared to Sham groups. The results showed that macrophage infiltration was increased in the kidney tissue of IRI model mice. Surprisingly, asiaticoside treatment could reduce the fluorescence intensity of F4/80 in kidney tissue. It indicated that asiaticoside inhibited the infiltration of macrophages in the kidney tissue of IRI model mice. The levels of IL-1β (Figure 4(a)), IL-6 (Figure 4(b)), TNF-α (Figure 4(c)), and IL-10 (Figure 4(d)) inflammatory factors were higher in the LPS group compared to the control group. However, the levels were reduced by asiaticoside. In contrast, the level of IL-10 (Figure 4(d)) was higher in the asiaticoside treatment groups than in the LPS group. These findings suggest that asiaticoside inhibited the inflammation induced by LPS in Raw264.7 cells. There was no change in the secretion of inflammatory factors Raw264.7 cells under asiaticoside treatment alone compared to the control group (Figure 5). Treatment with 100 μM asiaticoside attenuated the activation of IL-1β (Figure 5(a)), IL-6 (Figure 5(b)) and TNF-α (Figure 5(c)), but LPS-treated cells increased IL-10 from the control and asiaticoside augmented this increase. To further clarify the mechanism underlying the effects of asiaticoside on LPS-induced Raw264.7 cells, western blot analysis was performed to elucidate the potential pathways. Results showed that LPS increased the expression of M1 marker (inducible NO synthase-iNOS) and M2 marker (Arginase1) in Raw264.7 cells (Figure 5(e)). After asiaticoside treatment, the expression of iNOS (figure 5(f)) was suppressed, but the expression of Arginase1 (Figure 5(g)) was further improved. This suggested that asiaticoside ameliorated the inflammatory response induced by LPS through M2 polarization.","This study found that asiaticoside ameliorated the increased levels of serum BUN and Scr, as well as inflammatory factors, induced by renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Moreover, Raw264.7 cells with LPS-induced inflammation, exhibited enhanced inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10, but asiaticoside did not attenuate the increase in IL-10. In addition, asiaticoside treatment induced Raw264.7 cells toward M2 polarization by regulating M1 and M2 markers.It is well known that IRI is a systemic inflammatory disease. A previous study reported that the repair of renal IRI is associated with the production and release of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. Cellular mediators of immunity, such as macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer T, T and B cells, contributes to the pathogenesis of renal injury and repair after IRI. For example, IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine, secreted by a variety of immune cells including regulatory T cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, and helper T cells. IL-10 modulates the innate and adaptive immune responses, through exerting immunosuppressive functions to reduce tissue damage. Meanwhile, the regulatory immune cell network is activated by the mutual regulation of TNF-α and IL-10 to maintain immune homeostasis after IRI. TNF-α can induce a variety of inflammatory gene expression, thereby increasing inflammation. These studies confirm our findings, and indicate that the secretion of IL-10 and TNF-α was stimulated by LPS in macrophages. However, asiaticoside treatment attenuated IRI-induced inflammation by adjusting the expression of inflammatory mediators.Macrophages are involved in both inducing renal damage and promoting renal repair after renal IRI. On one hand, M1 macrophages express high levels of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase and proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6, TNF-α and IL-12. On the other hand, M2 macrophages tend to promote wound healing and inflammation resolution by inducing IL-4 and IL-13, which are anti-inflammatory factors.NO synthases (NOS) isoforms synthesize NO, a small signaling molecule. Among them, the third NOS isoform (iNOS) is negligible in resting cells and stimulated by cytokines and bacterial LPS. Arginase1 is one of members of the arginase family. Differential metabolism of L-arginine is characteristic of M1 and M2 macrophages by iNOS and Arginase1. The M1 and M2 macrophage activation stems from exactly these alternative metabolic states reflected by iNOS/Arginase1 balance. Recent evidences suggest that Arginase1 plays a fundamental role for M2 macrophages to acquire the phenotype. In the future study, we will use the blockers and interference to investigate the exact molecular mechanism by which asiaticoside promotes the transformation of macrophages.Surprisingly, the expression of iNOS-M1 marker was suppressed after asiaticoside treatment, but the expression of Arginase1-M2 marker was further improved. Collectively, these findings suggest that asiaticoside played a role on the polarization state of macrophages to some extent. However, further studies should be conducted to discover the molecular mechanism of asiaticoside on macrophage polarization regulation, and these results should also be verified in human disease.","In conclusion, the findings of this study provide evidence for the protective effects of asiaticoside on IRI mice and LPS-stimulated inflammatory responses in Raw264.7 cells. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the therapeutic potential of asiaticoside in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.All applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed."
41,TA041175,10.1007/s13197-023-05677-4,Upcycling of black currant pomace for the production of a fermented beverage withWolfiporia cocos.,"Pomace as a side stream from black currant juice production is mostly discarded,even though it is rich in nutrients like protein, fiber, sugars, anthocyanins,polyphenols, and other secondary metabolites. Fungi from the division ofBasidiomycota have a great enzymatic toolbox to recycle these complex mixtures ofnutrients. In particular, the edible medicinal fungus Wolfiporia cocos has beendescribed as a suitable biocatalyst to form pleasant aroma compounds infermentation processes. Therefore, medium optimization, upscaling, and filtrationwere performed to produce a beverage based on black currant pomace fermented withW. cocos. A trained panel described the beverage as highly pleasant, reminiscentof honey, flowers and berries with a well-balanced sour and sweet taste. Theflavor compounds linalool (citrus), geraniol (flowery), phenylacetic acid(honey), methyl phenylacetate (honey), eugenol (clove), and 2-phenylethanol(rose) were produced during fermentation and the concentrations exceeded theirrespective odor thresholds. The produced beverage was evaluated with 8.0 ± 1.4from 10 for the question of whether panelists would buy the product. Fungalfermentation with the edible fungus W. cocos enabled the production of a highlypleasant beverage and additionally may reduce waste by using pomace and tablesugar as sole ingredients. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version containssupplementary material available at 10.1007/s13197-023-05677-4.","Sommer, Svenja, Hoffmann, Janine Laura, Fraatz, Marco Alexander, Zorn, Holger",2023,Journal of food science and technology,2,False,False,True,"In a situation of depriving resources, great needs for sustainable solutions for feeding the growing population arise. Recycling of food side streams becomes thus more and more important. Pomace, as a pressing residue of the juice industry, represents a readily available and highly interesting side stream. Pomace mainly consists of fruit skin, kernels, pulp, and juice residues. As it is rich in fiber, protein, valuable unsaturated fatty acids, dyes, vitamins, and phytochemicals, pomace can contribute to a healthy diet (Farooque et al.; Struck et al.). Particularly, potentially healthy nutrients are anthocyanins, flavonoids, tannins, phenolic acids, and hydroxycinnamates, which may have a positive influence on cardiovascular-associated, ocular, and neurodegenerative neoplastic diseases (Farooque et al.; Gopalan et al.). Black currant pomace is typically characterized by a very low pH value of 2.6–2.8. This ensures a comparatively high microbiological stability, but complicates its recycling by traditional fermentation processes (Bagger-Jørgensen and Meyer). Attempts to use pomace as a substitute for flour in baking products, as an ingredient in smoothies, as a source of antioxidants, or as a substrate for alcoholic fermentation have been published (May and Guenther; Rohm et al.; Struck et al.). Nevertheless, it is still predominantly used for composting, biogas production, as feed or burned for power generation (May and Guenther; Rohm et al.).Utilization of this side-stream has a great potential for saving resources, improving the efficiency of crop growing, and reducing costs (May and Guenther). As black currant spritzer is a popular drink, its pomace may be particularly suitable for use in novel beverages. Fermented beverages have been consumed for ages as fermentation may improve taste, texture, nutrients, and shelf life (Hugenholtz). Alcohol-free fermented products are traditionally associated with health benefits and are currently becoming more and more popular. Examples of alcohol-free beverages, which are fermented by bacteria and yeasts, comprise, e.g. Kombucha, Kvass, water kefir, and Bionade (Hugenholtz; Marsh et al.). In recent studies, microorganisms like Lactobacillus species act as an additive for functional beverages with proposed health benefits (Hashemi et al.; Jouki et al.). Furthermore, some rare examples of beverages produced with higher fungi have been published. Besides using Trametes versicolor, Lentinula edodes, and Flammulina velutipes, W. cocos was successfully used to biotransform tea or wort leading to a highly pleasant flavor (Rigling et al.; Wu et al.; Zhang et al.). These fungi belong to the division of Basidiomycota, which are known for their unique properties to utilize nutrients. As they can degrade cellulose and hemicellulose, they can use substrates, which are otherwise hard to upcycle (Bouws et al.). Especially W. cocos has been reported to be a highly suitable biocatalyst to produce pleasant aromas and fruit acids. It is an edible medicinal mushroom, which is also known in China as Fu Ling or Indian Bread (Wang et al.). Highly fragrant compounds like linalool, methyl anthranilate, phenyl ethanol, benzaldehyde, methyl phenylacetate, and geraniol have been detected in several studies (Rigling et al.; Sommer et al.; Wu et al.).In this study, W. cocos was used as a biocatalyst to upcycle black currant pomace for the beverage industry. Suitable culture conditions to produce a pleasant taste and odor from black currant pomace were identified, and relevant aroma compounds and fruit acids were identified and quantified.","Chemicals were obtained from the following suppliers: acetone (99.8%) from Acros Organics B.V.B.A., sodium carbonate (≥ 99%, water free), sulfuric acid (98%), d-glucose, malt extract, and sodium hydroxide (≥ 98%) from Carl Roth GmbH & Co.

KG (Renningen, Germany).Authentic standard compounds were purchased from commercial sources: geraniol (99%), malic acid (> 99%), 2-nonanone (99%), 1-octen-3-ol (98%), 2-phenylethanol (99%), and terpinen-4-ol (97%) from Acros Organics B.V.B.A (Fair Lawn, USA), phenylacetic acid (99%) from Alfa Aesar (Haverhill, USA), acetic acid (100%), citric acid (water free), and oxalic acid-dihydrate from AppliChem GmbH (Darmstadt, Germany), l-tartaric acid (≥ 99.5%), eugenol (pure) from Carl Roth GmbH, linalool (97%), methyl phenylacetate (> 99%), trans-nerolidol (analytical standard), 2-nonanol (99%), and lactic acid (≥ 85%) from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, USA), and 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde (95%) from TCI Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan).W. cocos (No. 279.55) was purchased from CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre (Utrecht, Netherlands). Frozen black currant pomace of the cultivar Ribes nigrum L. cv. Tihope was provided by the Department for Pomology, Geisenheim University (Geisenheim, Germany).Fermentations were performed under similar conditions as described in the literature (Rigling et al.; Zhang et al.) W. cocos was maintained on malt extract agar (20 g L−1 malt extract, 15 g L−1 agar–agar). All media were prepared with drinking water and autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. As pre-culture, 200 mL ME medium (20 g L−1 malt extract) in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask was inoculated with an overgrown agar plug (diameter 0.4 cm) and homogenized using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (T25, IKA-Werke GmbH & CO. KG, Staufen, Germany) for 30 s with 10,000 rpm. After incubation for 7 days at 24 °C with shaking at 150 rpm in the dark, the pre-culture was homogenized and centrifuged for 5 min at 10 °C at 3,500 g. The supernatant was disposed and replaced with autoclaved drinking water. Main cultures were inoculated with 10% (v/v) of the washed pre-culture and cultivated with 150 rpm at 24 °C in the dark.For medium optimization, pomace concentrations of 60 g L−1, 80 g L−1, 100 g L−1, and 120 g L−1 were evaluated. The pH-value was adjusted to 4.4 before autoclaving with NaOH. pH measurements were performed with a Five Easy™ pH bench meter FE 20 (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, USA), which was calibrated each day using buffers of pH 2, 4, and 7 pursued from Carl Roth GmbH+ Co. KG. Sugar solutions were autoclaved separately and added to the medium before inoculation in equally sweet concentrations of 100 mL L−1 sucrose-syrup (580 g L−1 sucrose), 89 mL L−1 fructose-syrup (574 g L−1 fructose) and 167 mL L−1 glucose-syrup (502 g L−1). 75 mL L−1 sucrose syrup were added to test reduced sugar content. The final medium composed of 80 g L−1 black currant pomace and 100 mL L−1 sucrose-syrup (corresponding to 58 g L−1 sucrose) was fermented for three to four days until a pH 3.5 ± 0.1 was reached. The culture volume was scaled-up from 0.2 L in 0.5 L Erlenmeyer flasks (EF), 0.8 L in 2 L EF, 2 L in 5 L EF to 4 L in a 7.5 L fermenter (Labfors 3, Infors GmbH, Einsbach, Germany). The process parameters for the fermenter were 150 rpm (propeller stirrer), 1 L min−1 air vent flow during the first three hours, 0.3 L min−1 air vent flow afterwards, and 24 °C. The pH was continuously measured with a pH electrode (405-DPAS-SC-K8 S/120, Mettler Toledo), which was calibrated as reported above. After fermentation, mycelium and other solid matter were removed with a cheesecloth (100% cotton). The beverage was carbonated under pressure with 1.7 bar of food grade carbon dioxide (2.5, Praxair Deutschland GmbH) for three days at 4 °C.To investigate the influence of microfiltration and pasteurization, 15 L of the fermented beverage was produced in 5 L EF containing 2 L medium. Prior to filtration, the beverage was treated with 0.67 mL L−1 of Fructozym Flow UF (Erbslöh Geisenheim GmbH; Geisenheim, Germany) for 3 h at 4 °C. For cross-flow filtration, the beverage was cooled and treated with a Romicon Hollow Fiber Cartridge (100 µm, Koch Separation Solutions, Massachusetts, USA) at 2 bar. The permeate was short time-pasteurized for a few seconds at 78 °C, cooled down to 4 °C, and carbonated for three days (5 g L−1 CO2). Afterwards, the sparkling beverage was filled into 0.33 L bottles with the Juice dispenser PAS1-PAS2-81-V2 (mabo Steuerungselemente GmbH, Epplingen, Germany) and pasteurized (45 min, 78 °C) (Fig. 1).Sugars were quantified with the sucrose/d-fructose/d-glucose assay kit from Megazyme Ltd. (Wicklow, Ireland). Fruit acids were analyzed using an ion chromatograph with a conductivity detector (883 Basic IC Plus, Deutsche METROHM GmbH & Co. KG, Filderstadt, Germany). For analysis of acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, and tartaric acid, a Metrosep organic acids column (250 · 7.8 mm, Metrohm) and a pre-column (Metrosep Organic Acids Guard, 50 · 4.6 mm, Metrohm) were used. The eluent consisted of 0.5 mM H2SO4 in deionized water/acetone (85/15, v/v) with a constant flow of 0.5 mL min−1. The injection volume was 20 µL. Samples were diluted with deionized water (1:8), filtered (PET, 0.45 µm, MACHEREY–NAGEL, Düren, Germany), quantified with external calibration, and identified by addition of the respective standards. Oxalic acid was quantified with a Metrosep A sup 4-350 column (250 · 4.0 mm, Metrohm) using an eluent of 1.8 mM Na2CO3 and 1.7 mM NaHCO3 in deionized water/acetone (98/2, v/v) and a flow of 1 mL min−1. The suppressor solution consisted of 50 mM H2SO4 in deionized water. Samples were diluted with pure water (1:40), filtered (0.45 µm), identified by addition of the standard, and quantified by external calibration.For sensory analysis by a trained panel (n = 20, 10 male, 10 female, non-smokers, 17–44 years old), beverages were served at 4 °C in 40 mL glasses. Experiments were performed at white light. Each participant received 20 mL of the beverages and was asked to rate odor, smell, and acceptance. Regarding smell, participants evaluated the following attributes from 0 (no odor) to 5 (intense odor): black currant, carrot, citrus, flowery, fruit tea, fruity, honey, red currant, rose hip, sour, strawberry, sweetish, and berries of the forest. The taste also was rated from 0 to 5 for the attributes astringent, black currant, bitter, carrot, citrus, flowery, fruit tea, fruity, honey, red currant, rose hip, sour, sweet, and berries of the forest. Furthermore, each participant was asked about acceptance from 0 (I would not buy it) to 10 (very tasty, I would buy it).Flavor compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry–olfactometry (GC–MS–O) performed on an Agilent 7890B GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) in combination with an Agilent 5977B MSD and an ODP 3 (GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG, Mülheim a.d. Ruhr, Germany). It was equipped with a TDU 2, and a CIS 4 (all GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG). A VF-WAXms and a DB-5 ms column were used (both 30 m · 250 µm · 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies). 2 mL of samples were extracted at 24 °C for 1 h and 150 rpm with a Twister (PDMS, 10 mm, 0.5 mm film thickness, GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG). Desorption was performed at 40 °C (0.5 min)/120 °C min−1/250 °C (10 °C) in the TDU and cryogenic focusing in CIS at − 70 °C (0.5 min)/12 °C s−1/250 °C (5 min). A constant flow of carrier gas (1.56 mL min−1, helium 5.0; Nipon Gasses GmbH, Hürth Germany) was equally split between MSD and ODP. The GC oven was heated to 40 °C (3 min)/5 °C min−1/240 °C (12 min). The MSD was operated in scan mode (source 230 °C, 70 eV, m/z 33–300).GC-O analyses were performed by three participants (3 females, 24–28 years, non-smokers). Compounds were identified by comparison of retention indices (RI) according to van den Dool and Kraatz, recorded mass spectra, perceived odors, and in comparison to literature data (van den Dool and Kratz). Fragments used for relative quantification are listed in Table S1 (Supporting information).GC analyses and SBSE extractions were performed as described above, but the GC was not equipped with an ODP, a TDU (GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG) was used and the column flow was 1.2 mL min−1. Standard addition was performed with three steps by adding 0.5 mL standard solutions or 0.5 mL pure water to 2 mL of the beverage in 20 mL headspace vials (Table S2, Supporting information). 3,4-Dimethylbenzaldehyde, trans-nerolidol, phenylacetic acid, and terpinene-4-ol were quantified with splitless injection, and the other compounds with a split ratio of 50. Peak areas were determined using the fragments listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information) and plotted on the y-axis against the added mass. The intersection of the regression curve (x) was determined and the concentration (c) was determined with the used volume of the beverage (V) (Formula 1). The odor activity value (OAV) was determined by dividing the concentration (c) by odor thresholds (OT) (Formula 2) (Grosch).Samples were analyzed in random order. Averages, standard deviations, confidence intervals, and regression curves were determined with Excel. Sensory tests were performed by trained panelists and the statistical analysis of acceptance, odor and taste impressions were done with Excel using two-sample t-test for independent samples assuming different variances with α = 0.05 (Supporting Information, Table S3).The datasets analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.","The pomace had a strong scent reminiscent of black currant and colored the medium intensely red. During autoclaving, odor and taste changed and the color of the medium turned towards brown (Figure S1). Firstly, the characteristic black currant-like odor disappeared and the scent was reminiscent of berries, fruit tea, and carrot juice.The fermentation of the pomace-sugar-water suspension by W. cocos resulted in the formation of intense fruity and honey-like flavors. For medium optimization, the pomace content of 60 g L−1 was sequentially increased to 120 g L−1. A more intense taste and a denser mouth feeling, combined with a less watery impression resulted from higher pomace contents (Table S4, Supporting Information). Fermentations with 100 g L−1 or more showed a highly scented flowery-like odor, which was undesirable for a fruity beverage. The addition of sucrose prior to fermentation was essential for the aroma production. Reduced sugar content or the addition of sucrose after fermentation were both evaluated as less pleasant and reminiscent of fruit tea (Table S5, Supporting Information). Besides sucrose, the suitability of fructose and glucose was evaluated, and the odor profile was rated similarly but as less intense. The sour taste was weaker, and the beverage was overall rated as less tasty (Table S5, Supporting Information). Therefore, 80 g L−1 pomace and 58 g L−1 sucrose were chosen as the most suitable substrate for fermentation.An increased sour taste was observed during fermentation. The starting pH value of the cultures was 4.4 ± 0.2 after autoclaving which slowly decreased during the first hours of fermentation. The concentrations of citric acid changed barely during fermentation; 1000 ± 50 mg L−1 were detected in the non-fermented medium, and 1050 ± 10 mg L−1 in the fermented product after four days. The concentrations of oxalic acid increased strongly during fermentation from 8 ± 1 mg L−l before fermentation to 1,990 ± 630 mg L−1 after four days. Oxalic acid is the simplest dicarboxylic acid and occurs in several plants like spinach and rhubarb, animals, and bacteria (Noonan and Savage). It has a pleasant, characteristic, and astringent taste (Noonan and Savage). Cultures with a pH value of 3.5 revealed a pleasantly sour taste. The pH value was thus used as an indicator for the time of harvesting. All determined oxalic acid concentrations for fermented beverages with pH values of ≥ 3.5 were below 300 mg L−1.To test whether the produced beverage is suitable for a large-scale production, the fermentation was scaled up in shaking flasks. All cultures showed the characteristic odor and taste observed in the small-scale fermentations. The time of harvesting as defined by reaching a pH value of 3.5 ± 0.1 led to highly comparable impressions and proved the robustness of the pH value as an indicator for the termination of the fermentation process. Depending on the respective culture volume, the final pH value of 3.5 was reached after different fermentation periods. In 0.2 L in 0.5 L EK, a pH value of 3.5 was reached after 2.5 days, in 0.8 L in 2 L EK after 3 days, and in 2 L in 5 L EK after 4.5 days. Furthermore, the fermentation was performed in a fermenter with a volume of 4 L, in which a pH of 3.5 was reached after 4 days (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The flavor profile and the detected aroma compounds were highly similar to those observed in the smaller volumes (Supporting Information, Figure S3). This indicated that the fermentation process could be easily adapted to a bigger scale.For pilot scale processing, 15 L of the fermented drink was produced using 5 L EF with 2 L culture volume. The oxalic acid content of the non-processed drink directly after fermentation was 232 ± 3 mg L−1. During the filtration, the color changed to a lighter, intense red color. The beverage retained the pleasant sour–sweet character and 935 ± 20 mg L−1 of citric acid and 192 ± 2 mg L−1 oxalic acid were determined. The unique sour taste of citric acid and the sour and astringent taste of oxalic acid matched the impression of the beverage very well. Especially oxalic acid played an important role for the fruity and fresh taste of the fermented product.Prior to the fermentation process, the participants of the panel rated the medium as not tasty enough to buy it and evaluated it with 2.5 ± 2.4 of 10 (Fig. 2A). After fermentation and carbonization, the acceptance increased significantly. The bottled drink, which was additionally filtered and pasteurized, was rated similarly high (8.0 ± 1.4 of 10).The non-fermented substrate had a strong impression reminiscent of carrots, which was evaluated as unpleasant (Fig. 2B). The fermentation with W. cocos changed the odor profile and removed this unpleasant note. Furthermore, the perception of the impressions fruity, sweetish, berries of the forest, and honey increased. After processing, the profile remained similar, but the odor impression intensities slightly decreased for the attributes fruit tea, fruity, berries of the forest, and black currant. The taste profile also changed during fermentation (Fig. 2C). Similar to the odor, the carrot-like impression was perceived before fermentation and disappeared due to bioconversion. Regarding the taste, the attributes sour, black currant, fruity, and berries of the forest increased. Between the bottled and the non-processed sample, the differences in taste were weaker in comparison to the odors. The sour taste induced by oxalic acid correlated well with the concentrations of the fruit acids (Table S6, Supporting information). The sweet taste was comparable in all products. As indicated in Table S7 (Supporting Information), the sugar content did not change strongly during the processing steps. The bottled beverage fermented with W. cocos had a sugar content of 49 ± 1 g L−1. In particular, 2.7 ± 0.9 g L−1 glucose, 4.8 ± 0.8 g L−1 fructose, and 42 ± 0.22 g L−1 sucrose were detected. Several beverages with a reduced sugar content have been launched in the past. The following sugar contents were found by comparing 183 beverages on the German market: 51 ± 9 g L−1 in sugar-reduced lemonades, 62 ± 14 g L−1 in Fassbrause-varieties (a traditional German fermented drink), 86 ± 17 g L−1 in classical lemonades, and 92 ± 9 g L−1 in soft drinks. The sugar amount of the fermented pomace beverage is comparable to those of sugar-reduced lemonades and Fassbrause, which both have high consumer acceptance.GC–MS–O analyses of the non-fermented and the fermented beverage were performed to investigate the origin of the honey-like, flowery, and fruity odor. The chromatogram of the fermented beverage included several compounds, which were not detected in the non-fermented medium (Fig. 3A, B). To detect aroma compounds, GC-O measurements were performed with three participants, and 14 odor impressions were detected by at least two participants (Table 1). The identified compounds were quantified by means of standard addition. All regression curves had a coefficient of determination > 0.98. The concentrations of linalool 5, geraniol 7, phenylacetic acid 14, methyl phenylacetate 7, eugenol, and 2-phenylethanol 10 exceeded the odor thresholds (Table 2, Fig. 4A). Therefore, these compounds do likely influence the overall flavor impression. 1-Octen-3-ol 3, 2-nonanol 4, terpinene-4-ol 6, 2-nonanone 2, and trans-nerolidol 11 showed odor activity values below 0.1, and therefore most likely did not contribute to the overall aroma. Methyl phenylacetate 7 and phenylacetic acid 14 are known for their intense honey-like scent, and geraniol 9, 2-phenylethanol 10, and linalool 5 for their flowery and citrus-like notes. Eugenol 13 has a sweetish odor and is characteristic of clove. These compounds were absent in the non-fermented beverage or only detected in minor amounts (Fig. 4B). During the processing of the fermented beverage, the intensities of methyl phenylacetate 7 and geraniol 9 decreased, whereas the areas of the other compounds stayed constant. The compounds which define the pleasant aroma of the beverage are not typical for black currants. 4-Methoxy-2-methyl-2-butanthiol, (3Z)-hexenal, 1-octen-3-one, 1,8-cineol, and ethyl butanoate typically characterize the odor of black currants due to their high odor activity values. (Jung et al.). 4-Methoxy-2-methyl-2-butanthiol has a characteristic black currant like odor but is also ascribed as a catty urine smell in higher concentrations. It was neither detected by sensory evaluation nor by GC–MS measurements in the medium or the fermented cultures. This characteristic flavor compound of black currants is probably lost during autoclaving. (3Z)-Hexenal is known to be removed by freezing and was also not detected (Jung et al.). Odor impression 1 “mushroom” (Table 1) has the same odor and retention index as 1-octen-3-one. Because of its very low odor threshold (0.03 -1.12 ng L−1 air), the nose could be more sensitive than the MS detector (Guth and Grosch). Therefore, the odor impression could be explained by small amounts of 1-octen-3-one. 1,8-Cineol with its terpenic odor and ethyl butanoate with a pineapple-like odor were detected by GC–MS in the medium and the fermented beverage. During GC-O measurements, they were perceived less intensely than the compounds listed in Table 1. Overall, the beverage is characterized by a unique flavor composition, which can hardly be compared to the odor profile of fruit juices or other known beverages. The comparison with fermentations without pomace showed that the relative peak areas of the odor-active compounds differed from those of cultures without pomace (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Although the overall flavor impression does not resemble that of black currant, the pomace represents a rich source of nutrients to enable the formation of the flavor compounds by W. cocos.W. cocos has been used to ferment several substrates in the past, and some of the odor-active compounds detected in this study have also been reported previously. Sommer et al. fermented black currant pomace with W. cocos in solid-state fermentation. Supplementation of the solid-state cultures with sodium aspartate led to a wild-strawberry like odor. Linalool, geraniol, methyl anthranilate, and 2-aminobenzaldehyde were revealed to be key aroma compounds in recombination experiments. Rigling et al. fermented brewed green tea with W. cocos, and the odor of the beverage was described as jasmine-like. Besides methyl anthranilate, linalool, geraniol, 2-phenylethanol and methyl phenylacetate were detected as aroma-relevant. Wang et al. fermented okara with W. cocos, and the fungus successfully reduced the beany flavor and produced aroma compounds like 1-octen-3-ol, benzaldehyde, 2-undecanone, geraniol, linalool, and methyl phenylacetate (Wang et al.). Overall, the biotransformation properties of W. cocos revealed an enormous potential for the production of pleasant aromas. Various side streams of the juice industry may thus be upcycled to a wide range of fermented beverages.The sclerotium of W. cocos is a traditional tea ingredient in Chinese medicine. No acute or chronic toxicity was described for a dosage of 18 g sclerotium d−1 (Wang et al.). From the beverage developed in this study, the fungal mycelium is removed by filtration, and the beverage is pasteurized prior to consumption. In accordance with Regulation (EU) /2283, the produced beverage will probably be classified as a novel food, and is therefore subject to an approval procedure in the European Union. However, as no harmful effects have been described for W. cocos, the fungal fermentation is highly promising (Wang et al.). A potentially toxicologically relevant compound in the beverage is oxalic acid, which is suspected to cause kidney stones consisting of calcium oxalate (Noonan and Savage). Cell culture studies showed a correlation of oxalic acid concentration and reactive oxygen species (Moryama et al.). In a recent review, the interaction of calcium oxalate and renal epithelial cells in in vitro cell culture models has been discussed, and calcium oxalate has been reported to trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition and carcinogenic features in renal cells (Petrovic et al.; Peerapen et al.). A typical daily intake of approximately 220 mg oxalate has been reported in the literature (Crivelli et al.), however, the contribution of the oral intake of oxalic acid for the formation of kidney stones is not yet fully understood. The brown-rot fungus W. cocos is known to decrease the pH of the culture medium by producing oxalic acid (Espejo and Agosin). A concentration of 192 ± 2 mg L−1 oxalic acid was detected in the processed beverage. Other foods contain much higher amounts of oxalic acid. For instance, spinach contains 3200–12,600 mg kg−1 and the oxalic acid concentrations of rhubarb range from 2750 to13,360 mg kg−1 (Noonan and Savage). Rhubarb juice is also a popular drink, which contains approximately 3400 mg L−1 oxalic acid (Will and Dietrich). The oxalic acid concentration in rhubarb juice exceeds the concentration of the pomace based fermented beverage by a factor of 18. Regarding the oxalic acid concentration, the developed beverage seems to be suitable for occasional human consumption.The recycling of pomace for the production of a fermented beverage is highly sustainable and could reduce the need for classical spritzer and lemonades. As 29% of the berry mass remains as pomace, 3.6 L of the fermented beverage can be produced from the side streams of one kg berries. Therefore, resources may be saved as less cultivation area is needed, less product is burnt and a healthy and palatable diet is enabled (May and Guenther; Struck et al.).",,"We have found a highly sustainable method to reuse black currant pomace for human nutrition by the use of the fungus W. cocos. The fermented beverage was described as highly tasty and has the potential to be easily scaled up. The substrate-fungus combination led to a pleasant, unique flavor profile. As the fungus is described as edible and known as a natural drug, it has a great potential not only as a biocatalyst for flavor and fruit acid formation, but also as a functional drink. Further research regarding the nutritional and potential health benefits could be highly interesting."
42,TA049934,10.1038/s41598-018-30262-7,Identification of candidate UDP-glycosyltransferases involved inprotopanaxadiol-type ginsenoside biosynthesis in Panax ginseng.,"Ginsenosides are dammarane-type or triterpenoidal saponins that contribute to thevarious pharmacological activities of the medicinal herb Panax ginseng. Theputative biosynthetic pathway for ginsenoside biosynthesis is known in P.ginseng, as are some of the transcripts and enzyme-encoding genes. However, fewgenes related to the UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), enzymes that mediateglycosylation processes in final saponin biosynthesis, have been identified.Here, we generated three replicated Illumina RNA-Seq datasets from theadventitious roots of P. ginseng cultivar Cheongsun (CS) after 0, 12, 24, and48 h of treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Using the same CS cultivar,metabolomic data were also generated at 0 h and every 12-24 h thereafter until120 h of MeJA treatment. Differential gene expression, phylogenetic analysis, andmetabolic profiling were used to identify candidate UGTs. Eleven candidate UGTslikely to be involved in ginsenoside glycosylation were identified. Eight ofthese were considered novel UGTs, newly identified in this study, and three werematched to previously characterized UGTs in P. ginseng. Phylogenetic analysisfurther asserted their association with ginsenoside biosynthesis. Additionally,metabolomic analysis revealed that the newly identified UGTs might be involved inthe elongation of glycosyl chains of ginsenosides, especially of protopanaxadiol(PPD)-type ginsenosides.","Kang, Kyo Bin, Jayakodi, Murukarthick, Lee, Yun Sun, Nguyen, Van Binh, Park, Hyun-Seung, Koo, Hyun Jo, Choi, Ik Young, Kim, Dae Hyun, Chung, You Jin, Ryu, Byeol, Lee, Dong Young, Sung, Sang Hyun, Yang, Tae-Jin",2018,Scientific reports,2,False,False,True,"Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer, Araliaceae) is a traditional medicinal herb that has been widely used in East Asia for thousands of years. Roots of P. ginseng and their extracts have been reported to exhibit many therapeutic properties, e.g., maintaining immune homeostasis, improving brain function, preventing cancer, and adjusting blood pressure. Some of the pharmacological activities of ginseng have been attributed to Panax-specific ginsenosides, major triterpenoidal saponin constituents of ginseng. Ginsenosides are classified into three subgroups based on their aglycone backbone structures: dammaranes, oleananes, and ocotillol triterpenes. P. ginseng ginsenosides are mainly of the dammarane-type, which are further classified as protopanaxadiol (PPD; ginsenoside Rb1, Rc, Rd, Rg3, Rh2, etc.) or protopanaxatriol (PPT; Re, Rg1, Rg2, Rh1, etc.), according to the number of hydroxyl groups.We previously revealed the putative biosynthetic pathway for dammarane-type ginsenosides. Briefly, dammarenediol II is generated from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) by condensation and cyclization reactions, and these are successively catalysed by farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), squalene synthase (SQS), squalene epoxidase (SQE), and dammarenediol II synthase (DDS). The aglycone ginsenoside metabolites PPD and PPT, are biosynthesized from dammarenediol II through hydroxylation by protopanaxadiol synthase (PgPPDS, CYP716A47) and protopanaxatriol synthase (PgPPTS, CYP716A53v2). Glycosylation of PPD and PPT produces a variety of ginsenosides. The glycosylation of triterpenoidal aglycones is catalysed by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) that use uridine diphosphate (UDP)-activated sugar molecules as sugar donors. More than 150 ginsenosides have been identified from Panax spp.. This diversity is attributed to many unique UGT-encoding genes. However, only a few UGTs have been characterized for their substrate specificity: PgUGT71A27 (UGTPg1; PPD to compound K), PgUGT74AE2 (PPD to ginsenoside Rh2 and compound K to ginsenoside F2, respectively), PgUGT94Q2 (ginsenoside Rh2 to Rg3, F2 to Rd, respectively), UGTPg101 (PPT to ginsenoside F1, and further to Rg1), and UGTPg100 (PPT to ginsenoside Rh1, and F1 to Rg1). Many other UGTs associated with ginsenoside biosynthesis remain unidentified.Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is an important cellular regulator in plants, which is involved in seed germination, root growth, fertility, fruit ripening, senescence, and plant defence mechanisms. MeJA is an effective elicitor of ginsenoside biosynthesis in cultured cells and adventitious roots of P. ginseng. In our previous study, we applied integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics to investigate metabolism in MeJA-treated adventitious roots of various P. ginseng cultivars. Increased ginsenoside content corresponded with expression levels of candidate genes in the downstream ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway, including SQE and DDS; however, the dynamic regulatory mechanism for the final accumulation of ginsenoside, catalysed by UGTs, remains unknown.Our previous study revealed that, of three ginseng cultivars, adventitious roots of the CS cultivar produced the lowest level of ginsenosides and related gene expression. However, treating CS with MeJA dramatically increased the ginsenoside content and corresponding transcription levels of candidate genes. Therefore, we deduced that CS would be an appropriate cultivar in which to identify putative UGTs associated with ginsenoside biosynthesis in response to MeJA treatment. In this study, we used complementary transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches to investigate the UGT-catalysed biosynthesis of ginsenosides. Expression levels of UGT-related genes, and ginsenoside contents, were analysed in a time-dependent manner using MeJA-treated adventitious roots of P. ginseng, cultivar CS.","Adventitious roots of P. ginseng (CS cultivar) were cultured as previously described and amplified in bioreactors containing 1 L Schenk and Hildebrandt liquid medium supplemented with 3 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid and 5% sucrose. Three grams of these fresh proliferated roots was transferred into 250-mL flasks containing the same medium supplemented with 200 µM MeJA and cultured at 23 ± 1 °C on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm under constant dark conditions. We selected 21 flasks containing healthy growing adventitious roots and harvested these with three replications for each condition: 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after initiation of MeJA treatment.Standard references of 12 ginsenosides were purchased from Chengdu Biopurify Phytochemicals Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China; Rb1, Rb2, Rf, Rg2, Rg3, Ro, and F2) and Chromadex (Irvine, CA, USA; Rb3, Rc, Rd, and Re), or were provided by the Korean Food and Drug Administration (Rg1). Chemicals for tissue culture were purchased from Duchefa (Haarlem, The Netherlands), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade solvents were purchased from Avantor Performance Materials Inc. (Center Valley, PA, USA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States).Total RNA was isolated from MeJA-treated adventitious roots after 12, 24 and 48 h using the RNeasy Plant Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After examining its quality and quantity using a bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA), about 2 μg total RNA was used to independently construct RNA-Seq libraries with an insert size of 300 bp using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pooled libraries were sequenced with a paired-end read length of 150 bp using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform at LabGenomics Co. (Seongnam, Korea). Raw reads were deposited into the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequencing Read Archive. Accession numbers are provided in Table 1. Prior to differential gene expression analysis, reads containing bacterial contaminants were removed by mapping against available bacterial genomes using BWA. Adaptor contamination was then removed using the NGS QC Toolkit (v2.3.3).The current version of the ginseng gene set (IPGA_v1.1) was retrieved from the Ginseng Genome Database (https://ginsengdb.snu.ac.kr). Protein domains and motifs of UGT genes in P. ginseng were identified using InterProScan. Trimmed, high-quality RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the ginseng gene set to calculate fragments per kilobase per million (FPKM) using RSEM. The bioconductor package edgeR was used to identify differentially expressed genes in MeJA-treated samples. Genes exhibiting changes greater than two-fold with a significant false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.001 were considered differentially expressed.Total RNA was isolated from the adventitious roots of P. ginseng cultivar CS treated with MeJA using the RNeasy Plant Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality and quantity was examined using formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized using 1 µg of RNA (Invitrogen, USA), and the cDNA was diluted to 1/10 for use in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Power PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the Roche Lightcycler 480 Realtime PCR system (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The thermal cycling conditions for PCR were: 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. qPCR was carried out in duplicate for each sample. The qPCR primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2.Twenty milligrams of freeze-dried sample powder was sonicated with 1 mL of 70% ethanol for 90 min at room temperature. Extracts were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 3 min, then 500 μL of each supernatant was dried using nitrogen gas and resuspended in 1 mL 50% methanol. Prepared samples were analyzed using a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters Co., Milford, MA, USA) coupled with a Waters Xevo G2 quad time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (Waters MS Technologies, Manchester, UK), which was equipped with an electrospray interface (ESI). Separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters Co.) column. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and acetonitrile (B) with the following gradient condition: 20% B (0–9 min); 20–30% B (9–14 min); 30% B (14–17 min); 30–32% B (17–21 min); 32–42.5% B (21–26 min); 42.5–90% B (26–30 min). The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.3 mL/min, and the column temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Analyses of the samples (1.0 μL injected into the partial loop in needle overfill mode) were performed in negative ion mode in the 100–1500 Da range, with acquisition times of 0.2 s in centroid mode. ESI conditions were set as follows: capillary voltage 3.5 kV, con voltage 45 V, source temperature 120 °C, desolvation temperature 300 °C, cone gas flow 50 L/h, and desolvation gas flow 800 L/h. High-purity nitrogen was used as the nebulizer and auxiliary gas, and argon was used as the collision gas. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using sodium formate over a range of 100–1500 Da; leucine enkephalin (m/z 554.2615 [M –H ]−) was used as the lockmass to ensure mass accuracy and reproducibility. To identify ginsenosides, collision-induced dissociation (CID) data were recorded using MSE methodology. Low collision energy to detect precursor ions was set to 4 eV, and the high collision energy for fragmentation was set to 40–45 eV.Mass spectrometry (MS) ion markers were extracted from liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) raw data using Mzmine2 2.30 software. Mass ion detection was performed with the noise level set to 2000, and based on the detected mass list, peak lists were built with criteria as follows: minimum time span of 0.02 min, minimum height of 3000, and m/z tolerance of 0.006 Da (or 10.0 ppm). Chromatographic deconvolution was achieved using the baseline cut-off algorithm (minimum peak height of 3000, peak duration range of 0.02–0.30 min, and baseline level of 1000). Chromatograms were de-isotoped using the isotopic peaks grouper algorithm with an m/z tolerance of 0.006 Da (or 10.0 ppm) and a tR tolerance of 0.1 min. Peak lists for samples were aligned together using the join aligner module (m/z tolerance at 0.006 Da or 20 ppm, absolute tR tolerance at 0.3 min, weight for m/z of 70, and weight for tR of 30), and the aligned peak list was eventually gap-filled with the peak finder module (intensity tolerance at 50%, m/z tolerance at 0.006 Da or 10.0 ppm, and absolute tR tolerance of 0.2 min). Peaks from MS contaminants were identified by blank injection, and duplicate peaks were manually removed from the aligned and gap-filled peak list. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using SIMCA 13.0 software (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden), with Pareto scaling of data.","Using the most recent version of the P. ginseng annotation available in the Ginseng Genome Database (http://ginsengdb.snu.ac.kr/), 226 UGT genes were identified. Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis revealed that 11 of these were up-regulated after treatment with MeJA. Furthermore, using Interpro PROSITE (ID: PS00375), all 11 of these UGT genes encoded plant secondary product glycosyltransferase (PSPG) motifs, which are believed to be involved in binding the UDP moiety to glycosylate plant secondary metabolites. Three of the 11 UGT genes (Pg_S4493.1, Pg_S4157.4, and Pg_S4174.7) matched with the previously characterized P. ginseng UGT-encoding genes KF377585.1 (PgUGT1), KM491309.1 (PgUGT71A27), and JX898529.1 (PgUGT74AE2) (Fig. 1). The remaining eight were considered novel UGT-encoding candidates.Phylogenetic analysis was then performed with the candidate UGTs and known UGT proteins from other plant species (Fig. 2). Intriguingly, the candidate UGTs could be placed into the same groups as previously characterized UGT proteins from other plant species. UGTs belonging to the UGT74 family in Arabidopsis thaliana and P. ginseng recognize substrates of glucosinolates and ginsenoside Rh2, respectively. Evidence that members of the UGT74 family are involved in terpenoid biosynthesis has been reported in A. thaliana and P. ginseng (PgUGT71A27). We identified three new UGT genes (Pg_S4174.7, Pg_S4174.10 and Pg_S2390.5) belonging to the UGT74 family, along with a previously known P. ginseng UGT (PgUGT74A1).Members of the UGT73 family are involved in saponin glycosylation in Siberian ginseng (Eleuthreococcus senticosus, Araliaceae), and other plants such as Barbarea vulgaris, Medicago truncatula, and Glycine max. Our analysis revealed that the UGT Pg_S2351.7 is related to the UGT73 family, suggesting a role for that UGT in glycosylation in P. ginseng. Similarly, the involvement of UGT94 and UGT91 family members in triterpene biosynthesis was previously found in P. ginseng (PgUGT94B1) and G. max (GmUGT91H4). Here, two novel UGT genes (Pg_S6708.3 and Pg_S0804.16) were grouped into the UGT94 family, and one (Pg_S5521.1) was grouped into the UGT91 family. To validate our RNA-Seq data, we randomly selected six genes for reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays (Fig. 3). The resulting expression patterns were consistent with RNA-Seq data, except for one gene, Pg_S4174.10. We assume that this one discrepancy might have occurred because RNA-Seq read mapping is limited by the presence of highly identical paralog (>95% identity) copies of Pg_S4174.10 in P. ginseng.Adventitious root tissues from P. ginseng were prepared after 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h of MeJA treatment, and ginsenosides in extracts of those tissues were analysed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography–quad time of flight–mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) in triplicate (Fig. 4). Twenty-one major ginsenoside peaks were observed in LC-MS chromatograms. By comparing retention times and characteristic collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragment ions with reference compounds, 12 major ginsenosides (Rg1, Re, Rf, Rg2, Rb1, Rc, Ro, Rb2, Rb3, Rd, Rg3, and F2) were unambiguously identified. Other peaks were tentatively assigned by comparing their empirical molecular formulae, CID fragmentation patterns, and relative retention times, with those of previously published data (Supplementary Table 1). The analytical method used in this study was similar to that we used previously, with some modifications to characterize a greater number of ginsenosides in a metabolomic profile. In particular, the peaks of two major ginsenosides, Re and Rg1, could be separated within a chromatogram.Base peak ion (BPI) chromatograms showed that the levels of most ginsenosides were dramatically increased following MeJA treatment, but some – Rg1 (1), Re (2), and Ro (8) –showed relatively constant amounts. Intensities of chromatographic peaks at tR 3–5 min were also significantly increased; however, these metabolites were not expected to be ginsenosides (expected molecular formula were C18H30O8 and C19H32O10) although they could not be identified precisely. For more detailed analysis of ginsenoside profiles, our LC-MS dataset was processed into a peak table including 156 ion markers using Mzmine 2 software. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed on the processed ginsenoside profile to visualize time-dependent metabolic differences. In the PCA score plot, it is easy to recognize the ginsenoside accumulation pattern by increasing principle component 1 (PC1) (Fig. 5A). Between 0 and 120 h of MeJA elicitation, the PC1 value showed a constant increase and accounted for 75.2% of the total variance in the dataset. The PCA loading plot indicates that most ginsenosides correlate positively with PC1, implying that the levels of almost every ginsenoside increased after MeJA elicitation. The ginsenosides Rb1 (5), Rc (7), Rb2 (10), and Rd (14), and malonyl ginsenosides Rb1 (6) and Rd (15) showed especially high positive correlations with PC1, suggesting that biosynthesis of these ginsenosides is significantly induced by MeJA (Fig. 5B).Time-dependent accumulation patterns of the major ginsenosides were compared based on the ion intensity of their LC-MS profiles. Fold-changed relative abundance according to time after MeJA treatment was calculated using the Mzmine peak ion table (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6, and as also found by Oh et al., the amounts of PPT-type and oleanane-type ginsenosides were not affected by MeJA treatment, while the levels of PPD-type ginsenosides significantly increased with MeJA treatment and most PPD-type ginsenosides started to accumulate after 48 h. Our previous study suggested that PPD-type ginsenosides are involved in defence mechanisms against biotic stresses, while PPT-types are involved in mechanisms against abiotic stresses. The ginsenosides Rg3, Rd, and Rb3 showed the most dramatic accumulation, with 106.3, 43.0, and 32.2-fold increases, respectively, after 120 h. Contents of the ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, and Rc also significantly increased, with 15.2, 14.2, and 17.9-fold changes, respectively. The accumulation patterns of the ginsenoside F2, compounds Mc1 and O, and gypenoside XVII suggested that they became saturated after 96 h. Malonylated ginsenosides, a group of derivatives that are compartmentalized in the vacuole, also increased in content, but these changes were relatively small compared with non-malonylated ginsenosides.Figure 7 shows the possible biosynthetic pathways of the PPD-type ginsenosides that significantly accumulated after MeJA treatment. These pathways are proposed based on their sugar moiety sequences. Of the compounds identified, several have two glucose residues at the C3-OH position, and there are two possible pathways for the biosynthesis of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3 and Rc (see red and blue lines in Fig. 7). The red pathway follows the route from ginsenoside Rg3 to ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, and Rc through ginsenoside Rd. Several different UGTs might be involved in this step by adding different glucose moieties, such as Glc, Xyl, Ara(p) and Ara(f). The blue pathway uses different substrates, but the reaction is the same: adding a glucose residue to 3-O-glucoside. In MeJA-treated adventitious roots of P. ginseng, the fold-changes of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, and Rc show similar patterns as in Fig. 6, implying that these compounds are produced by a single UGT, or are co-controlled by very similar UGTs. Therefore, we suggest that the biosynthesis of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, and Rc follows the blue pathway shown in Fig. 7.Malonylation is a common form of plant metabolism used to store toxic materials separately in vacuoles. The fact that ginsenosides undergo malonylation therefore provides evidence for the role of ginsenosides in defence. Malonylated ginsenosides significantly elicited by MeJA treatment in our study were Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, Rd, and gypenoside XVII. We therefore suggest that these ginsenosides are the metabolites related to plant defence in P. ginseng, and propose that the 11 UGTs – including eight novel UGTs – identified in this study may contribute to the glycosylation of these ginsenosides.",,"We investigated time-dependent changes in UGT-related gene expression and ginsenoside content of MeJA-treated adventitious roots of the P. ginseng cultivar CS, which was previously shown to markedly increase ginsenoside biosynthesis upon treatment with MeJA. Transcriptomic analysis identified 11 candidate UGTs, including eight novel and three previously characterized UGTs. Metabolic profiling and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these candidate UGTs are strongly associated with ginsenoside biosynthesis. Furthermore, these newly identified UGTs might be related to steps involving the elongation of ginsenoside glycosyl chains, especially in PPD-type ginsenosides. Further functional characterization studies will elucidate the specific substrates of these UGTs in P. ginseng."
43,TA034736,10.3390/polym17030348,Physicochemical Properties of Nanoencapsulated Essential Oils: OptimizingD-Limonene Preservation.,"Essential oils exhibit antioxidant properties but are prone to oxidativedegradation under environmental conditions, making their preservation crucial.Therefore, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the physicochemicalproperties of nanoencapsulated essential oils (EOs) extracted from the peel ofsweet lemon, mandarin, lime, and orange using four formulations of wall materialsconsisting of gum arabic (GA), maltodextrin (MD), and casein (CAS). The resultsshowed that EOs from sweet lemon, mandarin, lime, and orange showed highersolubility (79.5% to 93.5%) when encapsulated with GA/MD. Likewise, EOs fromsweet lemon showed the highest phenolic content when using GA/CAS (228.27 mgGAE/g sample), and the encapsulated EOs of sweet lemon and mandarin withGA/MD/CAS (1709 and 1599 μmol TE/g) had higher antioxidant capacity. On the otherhand, higher encapsulation efficiency was obtained in EOs of lime encapsulatedwith GA/MD (68.5%), and the nanoencapsulates of EOs from sweet lemon with GA/MDhad higher D-limonene content (613 ng/mL). Using gum arabic and maltodextrinincreased the encapsulation efficiency and D-limonene content in EO of sweetlemon. On the other hand, the formulations with casein were the most efficientwall materials for retaining D-limonene from the EOs of mandarin, lime, andorange.","Mori-Mestanza, Diner, Valqui-Rojas, Iraida, Caetano, Aline C, Culqui-Arce, Carlos, Cruz-Lacerna, Rosita, Cayo-Colca, Ilse S, Castro-Alayo, Efraín M, Balcázar-Zumaeta, César R",2025,Polymers,2,False,False,True,"Nanoencapsulation has found increasing interest due to the demand for healthy foods or foods with a minimum of chemical additives that allow to maintain the stability and availability of bioactive compounds. Therefore, the use of nanoencapsulation of phenolic compounds, antioxidants, food colorants, antimicrobial agents, essential oils, minerals, flavorings, and vitamins is being studied to maintain or improve the foods’ properties, such as their sensory and nutritional attributes.Natural essential oils (EOs) are a complex mixture of volatile compounds, mainly terpenes, terpenoids, and phenols distributed in different parts of plants, including the fruit peel, as is the case of citrus fruits. Citrus EOs contain monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, with the main component being D-limonene. This compound has various uses in the food industry, highlighting its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. However, the potential of citrus EOs is affected by external factors (temperature, UV radiation, pH) given their chemical nature (monoterpene hydrocarbons), limiting their shelf life during food processing or storage.Protecting EO compounds against this, and according to Hasani et al., is necessary. Given this, a physical barrier using the nanoencapsulation technique promises to prevent the degradation of EOs and their bioactive components. The use of nanoencapsulation in the food industry allows the controlled release of EOs, improving their bioavailability. Moreover, it prolongs the shelf life of EOs by reducing their interaction with the food matrix and preventing their degradation or volatilization during storage, preserving their physical and oxidative properties over time.Nanoencapsulation employs wall materials in the encapsulants, such as maltodextrin (MD) and gum arabic (GA). However, Mahdi et al. and Moser et al. mention that employing a single wall material does not ensure the ability to encapsulate efficiently, making EOs unstable, leading to the need to use mixtures with other compounds such as proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, among others. On the other hand, it is also necessary to pay attention to the encapsulation methods such as drying and lyophilization, the latter being more efficient for separating nanoparticles by expelling water without altering their structure and shape.In this study, maltodextrin (MD), gum arabic (GA), and casein (CAS) were selected as wall materials due to their complementary properties that enhance the encapsulation efficiency and stability of essential oils. MD is a low-viscosity polysaccharide with excellent solubility and film-forming capacity, making it suitable for processes such as spray drying and lyophilization, as well as being affordable and tasteless. Gum arabic is a highly effective natural emulsifier due to its amphiphilic nature, stabilizing the oil–water interface and contributing to the controlled release of encapsulated compounds. Casein is a milk-derived protein that strengthens the structure of the capsules through its hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic properties, which help to ensure the stability of compounds such as D-limonene against adverse environmental factors. On the other hand, other materials such as sodium alginate, chitosan, gelatin, or vegetable proteins, although useful in some applications, have limitations such as high hydrophilicity, thermal sensitivity, or additional stabilization requirements that make them less suitable for this particular case. In this way, the combination of MD, GA, and casein provides a synergistic approach that improves the encapsulation, stability, and functionality of the essential oils.Given the importance of preserving key bioactive compounds such as D-limonene, the main component of citrus essential oils, the nanoencapsulation system is critical. The stability of D-limonene is often compromised due to its sensitivity to environmental factors such as oxidation and volatilization, which can lead to the loss of its functional and sensory properties. Therefore, in order to maximize the preservation of essential oil properties and functionality, the selection of suitable wall materials and nanoencapsulation techniques is critical. Nanoencapsulation protects the bioactive compounds of essential oils from external degradation and facilitates their controlled release. It also allows for controlled delivery of bioactive compounds, enhancing their functional properties. Nanoencapsulation offers advantages over other encapsulation techniques, such as liposomal encapsulation or cyclodextrin-based complexes, by being more scalable, cost-affordable, and versatile in terms of the types of materials that can be used as carriers. This makes nanoencapsulation a promising strategy to improve the shelf life and bioactivity of citrus essential oils, addressing the growing demand for natural and sustainable ingredients for the food industry. Therefore, this study evaluated the efficiency of nanoencapsulation with different wall material formulations to preserve D-limonene and their impact on the physicochemical properties of nanoencapsulated essential oils, providing valuable information for practical application.","Orange (Citrus sinensis) fruits were obtained from the local market in the district of Chachapoyas (6°13′46′46″ S, 77°52′21″ W, 2338 m.a.s.l.). Lime (Citrus limetta Risso) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata) were obtained from the district of Bagua (5°38′21′21″ S, 78°31′ 54″ W, 408 m a.s.l.). Sweet lemon (Citrus limetta sp.) was obtained from the district of San Nicolás (6°23′45″ S, 77°28′56″ W, 1616 m.a.s.l.). All fruits in the trial were washed. The pulps were discarded, and the peels were cut into 1 cm2 pieces and stored separately in vacuum storage bags at 4 °C until use.The following reagents and materials were used: Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, gallic acid, quercetin, sodium acetate (CH3COONa), aluminum chloride, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), acetonitrile, 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS+), maltodextrin (MD) and gum arabic (GA), casein (CAS), ethyl acetate, n-alkanes standard (Supelco, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), potassium persulfate (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), sodium carbonate (Spectrum Chemical Mfg. Corp, New Brunswick, NJ, USA, 99.5%), and methanol (JT Baker, Deventer, The Netherlands).The equipment used in this study was: steam distiller (Tecnal, TE-2761, Brazil), vortex (Analog Mini Vortex Mixers, OHAUS, Pine Brook, NJ, USA), freeze-drier (Labconco, 710402010 model, Kansas City, MO, USA), spectrophotometer (EMCLAB, EMC-11-UV Spectrophotometer, Duisburg, Germany), gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, 7890B GC System, Santa Clara, CA, USA), scanning electron microscope (ZEISS, V7.05, Jena, Germany), and FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Nicolet Is50 FT-IR, Waltham, MA, USA).Essential oils from citrus peels were extracted separately by steam distillation (Tecnal, TE-2761, Piracicaba, Brazil) for 1 h, at an extraction temperature of 80 °C. For this purpose, 300 g of peel in 500 mL of distilled water was used. After each extraction, an aqueous phase (aromatic water) and an organic phase (essential oil) were obtained and separated by decantation. The organic phase was stored at 2 °C until further use. The EO yield was calculated as described by Prommaban and Chaiyana using Equation (1). where: A is the volume of EO (mL), and B is the weight of the fruit peel (g).Prior to preparation of the nanoemulsions, combinations of encapsulating walls were formulated using maltodextrin (MD), gum arabic (GA), and casein (CAS), as described in Table 1. The formulations followed Karaaslan et al. because it provides antimicrobial activity and oxidative stability when employed in essential oils.The method described by Karaaslan et al. was applied considering a wall material ratio of 1/1 (w/w) and 1/1/1 (w/w/w). For this purpose, each encapsulating material was weighed according to the amount of essential oil to be encapsulated. Then, the wall materials were dissolved with 50 mL of ultrapure water for every 15 g solid material, and refrigerated at 5 °C for 12 h. Then, the wall materials were mixed with the essential oil (30% dry weight) and homogenized in a vortex (Analog Mini Vortex Mixers, OHAUS, Pine Brook, NJ, USA). Finally, tween 80 (5% of the dry weight of the wall material) was added and homogenized for 3 min until emulsification.The EOs nanoemulsions were frozen at −79 °C for 24 h, then freeze-dried (Labconco, 710402010 model, Kansas City, MO, USA) at 0.008 bar at −84 °C for 18 h. Subsequently, the material obtained was crushed in a mortar to form a homogeneous powder and placed in falcon tubes wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid light. Then, the samples (Figure S1, see in Supplementary Materials) were stored in a polystyrene box avoiding humidity until their analysis.The yield of recovered powder (SY) was calculated using Equation (2) (Table S1, see in Supplementary Materials), following Di Giorgio et al.. where: SY is the yield of recovered solids (%), Wi is the initial weight of the wall materials (g, dry basis), and Wf is the weight of the powder obtained after the freeze-drying process (g, dry basis).The moisture content was determined using a moisture analyzer (KERN Dab, Balingen, Germany). One gram of each nanoencapsulate was placed in the measuring pan and heated to 120 °C; the moisture content was recorded once a constant weight was reached.The solubility percentage was determined following the method described by Ferraz et al. with some modifications. For this purpose, 0.5 g of each powder was weighed, mixed with 25 mL of distilled water, and homogenized in a vortex at 80 rpm for 5 min. Subsequently, the solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. Finally, a 25 mL aliquot of the supernatant was placed in a pre-weighed Petri dish and dehydrated at 105 °C for 12 h. The solubility of the powders was calculated using Equation (3).On the other hand, hygroscopicity was determined following the methodology described by Al-Maqtari et al.. First, 0.5 g of nanoencapsulated essential oil was stored with a saturated sodium chloride solution at 25 °C and a relative humidity of 75.3%. After 1 week, the samples were weighed and expressed as a percentage of moisture absorbed, following Equation (4).Encapsulation efficiency was determined through the content of phenolic compounds according to Radünz et al.. For this purpose, the content of total phenolic compounds in un-encapsulated and nanoencapsulated EOs was measured by the Folin–Ciocalteu method. First, 0.5 mL of EOs was homogenized with 4.5 mL of methanol, 500 uL of the supernatant was separated, and 2.5 mL of diluted Folin plus 2 mL of 7.5% sodium carbonate were added. The solution was incubated for 2 h in the dark, and the absorbance was read (EMCLAB, EMC-11-UV Spectrophotometer, Duisburg, Germany) at 764 nm. A standard curve prepared with gallic acid was used to quantify the phenolic compounds, and the results were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of sample. The analyses were performed in quadruplicate (Table S1, see in Supplementary Materials).According to Papoutsis et al., the total phenolic content of the aqueous extract of the nanoparticles of each essential oil was determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method. For this purpose, 20 mL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was diluted in 180 mL of water (diluted Folin solution), and 7.5 g of sodium carbonate was weighed and dissolved in 100 mL of water. To obtain the 1:10 aqueous extract, 0.5 g of sample was weighed and dissolved in 4.5 mL of methanol.Then, it was homogenized in a vortex for 5 min and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to obtain the supernatant, from which 500 µL was separated, 2.5 mL of the diluted Folin solution, and 2 mL of the 7.5% sodium carbonate solution were added. The mixture was placed for 2 h in the dark at room temperature. Finally, the absorbance of a blank (methanol) was read at 764 nm in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (EMCLAB, EMC-11-UV Spectrophotometer). To quantify the total phenolic content, a curve (Y = 0.0004x + 0.0212) was developed using the gallic acid standard with concentrations between 0 and 2500 mM and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9986. The results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent per gram of sample (mg GAE/g sample). The analyses were performed in quadruplicate.The free radical scavenging activity of DPPH was determined following the method described by Al-Idee et al. with some modifications. An aqueous extract was prepared, from which 1 mL of the supernatant was taken, and 1 mL of methanolic DPPH solution (0.1 mM) was added. The mixture was incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, and the absorbance was read at 517 nm (EMCLAB, EMC-11-UV Spectrophotometer). Radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (5).With some modifications, the ABTS+ radical activity was assayed as described by Khalifa et al. and Balcázar-Zumaeta et al.. For ABTS+ (7.0 mM) solution, 88 µL of ABTS+ was mixed with 5 mL of potassium persulfate (2.45 mM) and incubated for 16 h at room temperature in the dark. To obtain an absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.002 at 734 nm, the solution was diluted with a volume of 200 to 300 mL of ethanol. Then 500 µL of each sample was added to 2.0 mL of ABTS+ solution, and the absorbance at 734 nm was measured against a blank. To determine the antioxidant activity, a standard curve was performed using Trolox (y = −0.0004x + 0.8502, R2 = 0.99). Finally, the results were expressed in µmol TE/g sample.The sample extract was prepared by weighing 0.5 g of powder of each nanoencapsulated essential oil, and 4.5 mL of ethyl acetate was added, shaken, and placed in a centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Then, the supernatant was separated, and 1 mL was filtered with a PTFE filter (0.45 µm). The analysis of the volatile compounds of the essential oil nanocapsules was performed by gas chromatography on a GC system (Agilent Technologies, 7890B GC System) coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MSD 5977B) equipped with a DB-5MS UI capillary column (60 m × 0.25 µm diameter × 1 µm thick). Helium was used as carrier gas at a 1 mL.min−1 flow rate.The injection was performed in split mode (40:1), with an injected volume of 0.5 μL. The temperature of the mass detector, injector, and ionization source were 250 °C, 150 °C, and 280 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was maintained at 60 °C for 6 min, then increased to 270 °C at a rate of 3 °C min−1 and maintained at 270 °C for 4 min. The ionization voltage was 70 eV. Mass spectral data were obtained in scan mode over a mass range (m/z) of 45 to 450 amu. The detected compounds were identified by comparing the mass spectra with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST Library 17) database. The identification of the compounds was confirmed by injecting the n-alkanes standard (C8–C20) and by comparing their retention indices (Table S2, see in Supplementary Materials). The external standard of (R)-(+)- limonene and the nanocapsules of the essential oils were diluted in ethyl acetate (C4H8O2). The external standard was used at different concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 μg mL−1) to form the calibration curve and quantify the D-limonene content (Table S3, see in Supplementary Materials).High-resolution images of the essential oil nanocapsules were taken using a scanning electron microscopy (ZEISS, V7.05, Oberkochen, Germany) following the method described by Kim et al.. The powder samples were placed on a double-sided black carbon tape mounted on a stainless steel pin. The samples were then coated with an ultra-thin layer of gold using a magnet sputter coater for 30 s in the metallizer (Q150RS Metalizador QUORUM, Quorum Technologies Ltd., Lewes, UK). Images of particle morphology and surface porosity/cross section were taken at 200×, 500× and 1000× magnification, respectively, with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV.Spectral data were collected within the spectral range 4000–400 cm−1 using 32 scans and a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 following the method of Kim et al., Lei et al., Timilsena et al.. For this purpose, images were obtained using an FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Nicolet Is50 FT-IR, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a single reflection diamond ATR sampling module.All data were subjected to an analysis of variance. Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used to determine the possible significant differences (95%) between treatments, for which the statistical program RMarkdown (RStudio, version 2022.07.2 + 576, Boston, MA, USA) was used. The data were analyzed in quadruplicate.","Solid yieldThe yield of recovered solids is shown in Figure 1. The solid yields of the nanoencapsulated EOs of four citrus fruits showed significant differences according to the four wall materials used. Nanoparticles from sweet lemon, lime, and orange had the highest yield when using MD/CAS (Figure 1A–D) (96.4, 96.6, and 96.1%, respectively). The yields found were higher than those obtained by Mohammed et al. and Mahdi et al., who obtained yields between 77.61 and 90.22% when microencapsulating Citrus aurantium essential oil, and between 77.77 and 89.39% when microencapsulating cider extract with AG, WP, and MD. In our study, mandarin nanoparticles showed the highest yield when using GA/MD (Figure 1B) (95.8%). Mahdi et al. found that nanocapsules with a high percentage of AG have a high powder yield due to their high film-forming ability. On the other hand, variations in the powder yield occur because of the high porosity generated by the formation of ice crystals. During freeze-drying, porosity is entirely eliminated to prevent structural collapse, with a minimal impact on the final volume.Moisture contentMoisture content is a crucial characteristic of nanoparticles, indicating their quality and stability during storage. Low content avoids caking problems, contributing to final acceptability. In addition, low moisture is associated with efficient drying, bioactivity, oxidation, water activity, stickiness, and flowability. Hence, high moisture content affects storage stability as the wall material changes to a rubbery state, releasing and degrading the core material. The nanoparticles of the four citrus fruits showed significant differences among the four types of wall materials employed (Table 2). It was observed that sweet lemon nanoparticles showed the lowest moisture content with GA/MD/CAS (4.57%). On the other hand, nanoparticles of mandarin and lime showed the lowest moisture content with MD/CAS (5.01% and 4.23%, respectively), and those of orange with GA/CAS (4.55%). The moisture content obtained was within the range reported by Mahdi et al., with values between 3.87 and 5.71% for mandarin essential oil nanoencapsulated with whey protein (WPI), gum arabic (GA), and maltodextrin (MD). On the other hand, they are above 1.90 and 2.87%, as Mahdi et al. reported when nanoencapsulating essential oil of mandarin with clove and cinnamon essential oils. Chew et al. obtained moisture content percentages between 2.7 and 3.9% by microencapsulating kenaf seed oil using β-cyclodextrin/gum arabic/maltodextrin. The nanoparticles of EOs from lime, sweet lemon, and orange had less than 5% moisture content with the wall materials containing MD/CAS, GA/MD/CAS, and GA/CAS, respectively, indicating a prolonged storage capacity.SolubilitySolubility is essential in determining the quality of wall materials used for the nanocapsules, since poorly soluble powders can cause problems during processing, resulting in economic losses. The nanoparticles of the four citrus fruits show three groups with significant differences according to the wall materials, where the nanoparticles of sweet lemon, mandarin, lime, and orange reached the highest solubility with GA/MD (90%, 91.5%, 79.5%, and 93.5%, respectively) (Table 2). However, no significant differences in solubility were found between the four EOs nanoencapsulated using GA/CAS and MD/CAS.The results obtained are in agreement with those reported by Rezende et al., who found a higher solubility in extracts of bioactive compounds from the pulp and residues of acerola (Malpighia emarginata DC) microencapsulated with GA/MD, whose solubility was associated with the solubility of the wall materials used. In studies on microencapsulation of ginger essential oil using MD and AG, a solubility of 84.6% was found. However, this finding was lower than the highest solubility percentage (93.35%) found for the orange nanoparticles in our study, although they were within the values obtained by Karrar et al., who reported a solubility between 86.61% and 90.90% when microencapsulating guru seed oil employing MD, AG, and WPI as wall materials. Solubility is important because it broadens the application possibilities of citrus peel essential oils in food products.HygroscopicityThe ability to absorb moisture, known as hygroscopicity, is crucial for evaluating the quality of nanoencapsulated oils. This characteristic is particularly significant, as water absorption during storage can lead to lipid oxidation, influencing the nutritional and flow characteristics of the powder. The nanoparticles of sweet lemon showed significant differences among the four types of wall material used, with GA/MD giving the lowest hygroscopicity (6%). The encapsulating wall conditions is related to the hygroscopic capacity of the nanoencapsulant; thus, vast ranges can be observed, for sweet lemon and mandarin, with values from 6.3 to 16.5% and 7.1 to 16.3% (Table 2). However, the ranges observed in mandarin (7 to 16%) were within the values obtained by Mahdi et al. for mandarin oil (12.05 and 15.42%) encapsulated with GA/MD/WPI. On the other hand, the hygroscopicity exhibited by the other citrus fruits was within the range reported by Karrar et al. for microcapsules of guru seed oil encapsulated with MD, AG, and whey protein (6.95% and 8.76%). On their side, Locali et al. reported values for pink pepper essential oil microcapsules (8.5% and 9.3%). On the other hand, formulations containing MD showed the lowest hygroscopicity since it is considered a low hygroscopicity wall material.Encapsulation efficiencyThe encapsulation efficiency of sweet lemon nanoparticles was affected according to the wall material used. For this citrus variety, the highest encapsulation efficiency was 75.5%. On the other hand, the encapsulation efficiency of mandarin nanoparticles did not show significant differences between the wall materials used, with an average efficiency of 68.9%. lime presented significant differences according to the encapsulating materials, having GA/MD the highest encapsulation efficiency (68.5%), while orange nanoparticles showed two significant heterogeneous groups with 29.5% and 41.9% (Table 2).This result could be because gum arabic, a highly branched heteropolymer of sugars with a small amount of protein covalently bonded to the carbohydrate chain, is a film-forming agent. This property allows it to entrap the encapsulated molecule effectively. Maltodextrin, a widely used glucose polymer, is known for its high solubility and low viscosity, making it an ideal coating material. The properties of these substances, such as the stretching vibration of the C-H bonds of alkenes, the stretching vibration of the C-H bonds of CH2, the stretching vibration of carbonyls (-C=O), the stretching vibration of aromatic rings, and the stretching vibration of the C-C bonds of glucose, contribute to their distinct applications in coating. Therefore, these properties play a crucial role in essential oils’ emulsification and coating process.The results are below those of Radünz et al., who obtained an encapsulation efficiency (88.9%) of thyme essential oil when encapsulating maltodextrin and casein as wall materials. On the other hand, Mahdi et al. obtained an efficiency between 72.11% and 87.20% when encapsulating citron extract with GA, modified starch, whey protein, and maltodextrin. In this study, the values were above from what Shetta et al. obtained, reporting values between 8.15% and 23.1% when encapsulating peppermint and green tea essential oils with chitosan. The variations in the encapsulation efficiency (%) are due to the oil components’ affinity with the wall materials. The efficiency in encapsulating phenolic compounds is associated with the structure, ability to form films, and solubility of the wall material used. In addition, Mahdi et al. mention that the presence of whey protein and the absence of GA in formulations negatively affects encapsulation efficiency, which is congruent with what was found in this study, as GA/MD conferred the highest encapsulation efficiency to lime and orange nanoparticles.The efficiency, solubility and hygroscopicity of citrus peel essential oils encapsulation is highly dependent on the physicochemical properties of the wall materials used. Previous studies have shown that combinations such as gum arabic (GA) and maltodextrin (MD) provide excellent film-forming capacity and solubility, allowing a more stable and efficient encapsulation of phenolic and antioxidant compounds. Additionally, it safeguards sensitive compounds from oxidation and thermal degradation while permitting a controlled release of compounds, enhancing their bioavailability in food and pharmaceutical applications. In contrast, materials such as chitosan show limited interaction with certain lipophilic compounds, explaining the lower encapsulation efficiencies observed in other studies. Moreover, when utilizing protein sources like casein or whey protein, it’s crucial to include carbohydrates such as gum arabic. Otherwise, the effectiveness of these combinations may be compromised. This behavior emphasizes the need for selecting wall material combinations that maximize both molecular compatibility and functional properties for specific applications. Using appropriate wall materials, nanocapsules enhance the stability of essential oils’ chemical properties. This indicates their potential application in the food industry and the ability to achieve synergistic effects in the nanoencapsulation of bioactive ingredients.The stable chemical properties that characterize nanocapsulation of essential oils make it a versatile tool for the food industry. Its applications are varied, ranging from the controlled release of bioactive compounds to extending shelf life, all while preserving organoleptic properties, reducing hydrophobicity, and controlling microbiological aspects of food. This versatility also makes it a promising option for developing functional foods, depending on the type of wall material used and its potential synergistic effects with the bioactive ingredients.Total phenolic contentThe wall material for encapsulating EOs from sweet lemon significantly affected the phenolic content, with GA/CAS having the highest one (228.27 mg GAE/g sample, Table 3). These results agree with those reported by Al-Maqtari et al., who found that combining AG with a protein improves the encapsulation efficiency of phenolic compounds. On the other hand, mandarin nanoparticles showed no significant differences between the types of wall materials used, with an average phenolic content of 150 mg GAE/g of sample. Nanoparticles of lime also showed significant differences among the wall materials, with MD/CAS giving the highest phenolic content (98.40 mg GAE/g sample), a fact in agreement with that reported by Papoutsis et al., who found high phenolic content for encapsulations of citrus by-product extracts with MD and soy protein. The results found in this work could be attributed to the ability of proteins to interact with various wall materials, including MD, as they form colloidal particles that encapsulate polyphenols. Orange nanoparticles showed two heterogeneous groups with significant differences with values of 65.5 mg GAE/g sample and 85.8 mg GAE/g sample (Table 3). CAS stands out in sweet lemon and lime nanoparticles because there is no association between the protein used as wall material and the polyphenol extracts, which ensures that this material grants better conservation and protection.Stability of antioxidant activity by the DPPH assayDue to its hydrogen-donating capacity, the DPPH method generates an antioxidant profile encompassing reactivity towards aqueous radicals through radical quenching. Phenolic compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups exhibit higher free radical scavenging activity, especially against DPPH. Nanoparticles of sweet lemon showed two homogeneous groups with significant differences with inhibition of 69.1% and 80.7%. Nanoparticles of mandarin and lime showed no significant differences between encapsulating wall materials, with 71.9% and 70.1%, respectively. In contrast, nanoparticles of orange showed three heterogeneous groups of wall materials with significant differences, being GA/MD the one that provided the highest inhibition (69.5%) (Table 3). The results obtained are related to the phenolic content in citrus nanoparticles because phenolic compounds are antioxidants as they act as electron donors to unstable free radical molecules. In this regard, the high antioxidant activity of sweet lemon nanoparticles may be associated with their high phenolic content.On the other hand, the DPPH radical scavenging activity exhibited by mandarin was higher than that reported by Kamal et al., who found that the essential oil from the peel of this citrus fruit showed a moderate radical scavenging activity of 24.08% compared to that obtained in this study (71.9%). In addition, GA/MD was the encapsulant material that provided the highest antioxidant activity to orange nanoparticles (Table 3). This behavior was due to the ability of MD to protect the essential oil, which results in agreement with that obtained by Moosavy et al., who obtained high antioxidant activity by microencapsulating lemon essential oil using MD. However, Khalifa et al. reported that the amount of polyphenols and antioxidant activity of mulberry microparticles depended on the wall material containing whey protein (WP), reporting better protection than MD and AG. These differences may be because MD and AG are more efficient in encapsulating essential oils. After all, the formulations containing these compounds had higher phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. The antioxidant activity of citrus essential oil is related to its chemical composition (D-limonene, α-pinene, α-terpinene) since other authors have already reported this activity in essential oils rich in monoterpenes (D-limonene, α-pinene). Moreover, the synergistic effect between the compounds of essential oils enhances their antioxidant activity.Stability of antioxidant capacity by ABTS+ assayThe ABTS+ assay is used to determine radical scavenging effects. In contrast to an H-donor, it leads to the formation of ABTS+ and then to a decolorization of the solution at 734 nm. The decrease in absorbance due to antioxidant capacity reflects a free radical scavenging capacity. A compound’s reducing capacity significantly indicates its antioxidant potential. The antioxidant capacity of sweet lemon nanoparticles exhibited significant differences according to the type of wall material. Using GA/MD/CAS, conferred the highest antioxidant capacity (1709 μmol TE/g).On the other hand, significant differences were observed in the nanoparticles of mandarin, according to the wall material used. Encapsulating with GA/MD/CAS permitted the highest antioxidant capacity (1599 μmol TE/g). Likewise, the nanoparticles of lime exhibited two homogeneous groups with significant differences with values of 1099 μmol TE/g and 1219 μmol TE/g, while in the nanoparticles of orange, the antioxidant capacity varied according to the wall material, where GA/CAS was the one that gave the highest antioxidant capacity (1059 μmol TE/g) (Table 3).Volatile compounds from nanocapsules of essential oils by GC-MSCitrus essential oils comprise hydrocarbons, aldehydes, esters, ketones, and some miscellaneous compounds ranging from 20 to 60 compounds per Citrus EOs. Among these are the volatile compounds constituting 85% to 99%, comprising monoterpenes (97%), sesquiterpenes, and sesquiterpenoids. The chemical composition of citrus nanoparticles is shown in Figure 2, in which 5 (100%) components were identified in the nanoparticles of nanoencapsulated EOs from mandarin (Figure 2A, Table S4, see in Supplementary Materials). It was also found that GA/MD was the most efficient wall material since it conserved 4 components. On the other hand, 10 (100%) components were identified in mandarin nanoparticles (Figure 2B), with GA/CAS being the most efficient material since it conserved 8 components. Also, 8 (100%) components were identified in lime nanoencapsulate (Figure 2C), where GA/CAS was the most efficient wall material since it conserved 5 components. In contrast, in the orange nanoparticles, 5 (100%) components were identified (Figure 2D), and GA/MD/CAS was the most efficient wall material since it conserved the 5 components.D-Limonene content in nanoencapsulated EOs of citrus peelsFigure 3 shows the content of nanoencapsulated D-limonene in the four citrus fruits. It is observed that the nanoparticles of sweet lemon showed significant differences depending on the wall material used. It was observed that when GA/MD was used, the highest amount of D-limonene (Figure 3A) (613 ng/mL) was found. On the other hand, the D-limonene content of mandarin, lime, and orange EOs nanoencapsulated showed significant differences according to the type of wall material (Figure 3B–D), with MD/CAS, GA/CAS and GA/MD/CAS being the most efficient (721 ng/mL, 536 ng/mL, and 521 ng/mL of D-limonene, respectively).Additionally, the relative amounts were 81.37, 54.65, 60.65, and 77.23% for nanoencapsulated EOs from sweet lemon, mandarin, lime, and orange, respectively (Figure 2). The results obtained are lower than those of Kang et al., who found 97.2% D-limonene in citrus essential oil nanoemulsions. Similarly, Dao et al. reported that mandarin peels essential oil contains between 80.3% and 96.2%. On the other hand, the values in our study are higher than those found by Himed et al., reporting 67.08% of D-limonene for encapsulated Citrus limon. In the same way, Smeriglio et al. obtained 48.91% of D-limonene in C. lumia Risso. In this last study, the content of D-limonene varied from 32 to 98% in the genus Citrus, 68.98% in sweet oranges, and 47.56% in lemons. The wall material that was most efficient in retaining the volatile components of sweet lemon was GA/MD, possibly due to the ability of maltodextrin to retain volatile compounds in encapsulated systems.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of nanoencapsulated EOs from citrus peelsScanning electron microscopy micrographs were taken for nanocapsules of essential oil of C. limetta Risso (Figure 4) C. sinensis (Figure 5), C. limetta sp. (Figure 6), and C. reticulata (Figure 7) using different combinations of wall materials: MD/GA (A), GA/CAS (B), MD/CAS (C), and MD/GA/CAS (D). The images show remarkable differences in surface morphology and particle structure depending on the formulation used. Nanocapsules with MD/GA (A) had spherical particles with a smooth surface and no pores or cracks, indicating effective encapsulation and structural stability. Capsules with GA/CAS (B) showed a more irregular morphology, with folds and roughness, which could be attributed to the different interaction between gum arabic and casein. On the other hand, formulations with MD/CAS (C) showed more compact and homogeneous particle structures, indicating a better interaction between maltodextrin and casein as wall materials. Finally, nanocapsules with MD/GA/CAS (D) had a more defined and geometrical surface, with well-formed particles, suggesting an optimal synergy between the three wall materials (maltodextrin, gum arabic, and casein), similar structures to those reported by Mahdi et al..These morphological differences are directly related to the encapsulation capacity and structural stability of the nanocapsules. In particular, the MD/GA/CAS formulation seems to provide the highest efficiency in terms of homogeneous particle formation and protection of chemical and volatile compounds (Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively), in line with the results of Mahdi et al.. In addition, the roughness observed in some formulations could affect the controlled release of essential oils, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting wall materials according to the intended application.ATR FT-IR Spectroscopy of nanoencapsulated EOs from citrus peelsThe ATR-FTIR spectra of nanoencapsulated essential oil of C. limetta Risso (Figure 8A), C. limetta sp. (Figure 8B), C. reticulata (Figure 8C), and C. sinensis (Figure 8D), using different wall materials (GA/CAS, MD/CAS, MD/GA, MD/CAS/GA), revealed characteristic peaks confirming the interaction of the essential oils with the encapsulation materials. In the 4000–3000 cm−1 region, a prominent peak was observed at 3316 cm−1, associated with O-H stretching vibrations due to the hydrophilic components of the wall materials (GA, CAS, MD).In the 3000–2800 cm−1 region, bands around 2878 cm−1 were detected, related to the C–H stretching vibrations of the essential oils and the structure of the aromatic rings. In the 1800–1500 cm−1 region, peaks such as those at 1711 cm−1, associated with the C=O group, and signals between 1483 and 1423 cm−1, indicated interactions between the bioactive compounds and the encapsulation materials. Likewise, in the 1500–1000 cm−1 region, the peak at 1138 cm−1 confirmed the presence of C–O–C structures characteristic of the carbohydrates in the wall materials, while peaks in the 939–756 cm−1 range reflect the specific molecular characteristics of the essential oils. In particular, combinations of wall materials, especially MD/CAS/GA (Figure 8D), showed sharper spectra, suggesting a higher efficiency in encapsulation and protection of the bioactive compounds. This may be attributed to synergistic interactions between simple polysaccharides (maltodextrin), proteins (casein), and complex polysaccharides (gum arabic). These differences show that the type of wall material significantly influences the retention and stabilization of functional compounds, optimizing their potential for applications in food products.",,"The results highlight the importance of the wall material role in the stability and functional properties of encapsulated essential oils. The combination of wall materials not only influenced the physical yield and moisture content but also played a pivotal role in retaining bioactive compounds, such as phenols and D-limonene, which are essential for the its antioxidant and sensory properties. Moreover, the ability of gum arabic and casein to better conserve phenolic compounds was demonstrated. Also, the synergistic effects observed among maltodextrin, gum arabic, and casein combinations (GA/MD/CAS) underline the importance of using multi-component encapsulating systems for achieving optimal performance. These findings suggest that the strategic selection and combination of wall materials can be tailored to specific essential oils and their intended applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries, offering a versatile approach to enhancing product stability and functionality.The best physical yields were obtained with the mixture of maltodextrin plus casein (MD/CAS) as an encapsulating wall for essential oils of sweet lemon, lime, and orange. Furthermore, adding gum arabic (GA/MD/CAS) to this mixture resulted in nanoparticles with lower moisture content in the essential oil of sweet lemon. Low moisture content was also obtained when MD/CAS was used to encapsulate the essential oil of mandarin and lime and gum arabic plus casein (GA/CAS) for the essential oil of orange. When gum arabic and maltodextrin (GA/MD) were used as an encapsulant, the solubility of the four essential oils was increased, and the hygroscopicity of sweet lemon essential oil nanoparticles was reduced. Gum arabic and casein (GA/CAS) allowed the encapsulation of higher phenolic compounds from the essential oil of sweet lemon. However, when gum arabic was replaced by maltodextrin (MD/CAS), phenols from the essential oil of lime were better conserved. Additionally, formulations containing gum arabic and casein (GA/MD/CAS, GA/CAS) better conserved the essential oil of sweet lemon, mandarin, and orange.Encapsulation efficiency depends on the encapsulating wall material. Using gum arabic and maltodextrin (GA/MD) increased the encapsulation efficiency of lime EO. Similarly, it encapsulated more D-limonene from the essential oil of sweet lemon. On the other hand, the formulations with casein (MD/CAS, GA/CAS, and GA/MD/CAS) were the most efficient wall materials for retaining D-limonene from the EOs of mandarin, lime, and orange. Finally, it is confirmed that the encapsulant material depends on the type of essential oil and the physicochemical properties to be conserved."
44,TA048815,10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.2.563,Anti-Proliferative Activity of Triterpenes Isolated from Clinicanthus nutans onHep-G2 Liver Cancer Cells.,"Problem statement: Clinicanthus nutans has been used by Malaysian since long timeago. It is used to treat many diseases including cancer. Many studies carried outon its crude extract but no clear report on the specific secondary metabolitesresponsible for its nature in treating selected diseases. Objective: This studyaims to confirm the practice carried out by many people on the usage ofClinicanthus nutans in treating cancer. Methods: C. nutans leaves were extractedby methanol. Thin layer chromatography was used to identify the suitable solventfor fractions separation. The fractions were then separated at larger volumeusing gravity column chromatography. Each fraction was tested on itsanti-proliferative activity on Hep-G2 liver cancer cells by MTT assay. Thephytochemical screening was carried out to identify the bioactive compound basedon qualitative analysis. Results: The fraction 2 (F2) of C. nutans showed thelowest IC50 value of 1.73 μg/ml against Hep-G2 cancer cells, and it is identifiedas triterpenes. Conclusion: The fraction F2 identified as triterpenes isolatedfrom C. nutans has potential as an anti-proliferative agent against liver cancer.","Zakaria, Khairun Najwa, Amid, Azura, Zakaria, Zubaidah, Jamal, Parveen, Ismail, Azli",2019,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2,False,False,True," Clinacanthus nutans (C. nutans) Lindau, or commonly known as Sabah Snake Grass or Belalai Gajah in Malay is one of the plants that is known for its high medicinal values. C. nutans belongs to the family of Acanthaceae. It is a small shrub, native in tropical weather and can be found easily in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia (Alam et al., 2016). It is normally consumed by Malaysian especially the Chinese ethnic because they believed it might prevent them from cancer. Interestingly, few scientific studies were carried out to confirm these.Arullapan et al., (2014) conducted a study to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of C. nutans leave extracts and its semi-fractions. In that study, HeLa (cervical cancer) and K-562 (leukemia) cell lines were used. The crude extract of C. nutans leaves (0.2 to 10 µg/mL) was tested against HeLa and K-562 cell lines using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and antioxidant activity using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The results showed that the fractions isolated from ethyl acetate leaf extract demonstrated cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. The IC50 values against HeLa and K-562 cell lines during cytotoxicity assay were 18.0 and 20.0 µg/mL, respectively. However, there is no study reported liver cancer treated with C. nutans extract.The Hep-G2 cell line was originally established in 1979 by Barbara Knowles and colleagues (López-Terrada et al., 2009). Hep-G2 liver cancer cell line was derived from 15 years old Caucasian American white male, whose well-differentiated Hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer (ATCC, 2003). Hep-G2 is adherent, epithelial-like cells growing as monolayers and in small aggregates. These cells are epithelial in morphology, have a modal chromosome number of 55, and are not tumorigenic in nude mice (ATCC, 2003). Because of their high degree of morphological and functional differentiation in vitro, Hep-G2 cells are a suitable model to study human liver diseases (Mersch-Sundermann et al., 2004)."," Raw Material The leaves of C. nutans were used for this project. The C. nutans leaves were harvested from the self-plant garden in Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. A plant sample deposited in the herbarium at the Kulliyyah of Architecture and Environmental Design (KAED), International Islamic University Malaysia with voucher number KAED/HBL/S1A047/2018/706. The name of the plant was checked on www.theplantlist.org  Cell Line This study used Hep-G2 liver cancer cell line (originally from ATCC No: HB-8065; obtained from Institute Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur) as the experimental cancer cells. It was kept in liquid nitrogen until further use.  Chemicals and Reagents All the chemicals and reagents used in this project are laboratory grade. They were purchased from Merck (USA), Sigma-Aldrich (USA), GIBCO (USA) and Fisher Scientific (USA).  C. nutans Extraction and Fractionation The freshly harvested of C. nutans leaves were air dried for 72 h. The dried leaves were grounded into a fine powder to increase the surface area. The C. nutans extract (25 g) was then prepared using the maceration process with methanol (250 mL) for 72 h at room temperature under constant shaking. The extract collected was wrapped with aluminum foil, to keep them in the less-light exposure condition and stored at 4 ͦC chiller until use (P’ng et al., 2013). The C. nutans extract was separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and next by column chromatography. TLC plates (20 x 10 cm) coated with silica gel (Merck, Germany) and ultraviolet (UV) lamp for spot detection was used in this experiment. Samples (20 µL) were spotted on TLC plates using a syringe, two centimeter above the bottom edge and allow to develop using mobile phase until it reached the solvent front. The plates were then removed, dried, observed under the UV light and finally, the RF-values were calculated. Best separations were achieved with hexane: ethyl acetate (7:3). Column chromatography was performed using the identified mobile phase to get more volume of each fraction.  Anti-proliferative Test  The Hep-G2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1 % antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin) and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and incubated at 37oC in a 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Once confluence, Hep-G2 cells were trypsinised, re-suspended in media and counted using a haemocytometer. The cells were then diluted to 1.0 x 105 cells/mL and plated in 100 mL of medium/well in 96-well plate. The cells were then incubated for 24 h. After 24 h, media was removed and the cells were then exposed to the four C. nutans leaves extract active fractions in the presence of various concentrations at eight concentration intervals (between 0.78 and 100 µg/mL) for another 24 h at 37 ͦC. The sample solutions were then removed and washed with phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). A volume of 20 µL/well of MTT at 5 mg/mL concentration was added to each well. The assay then was incubated for 4 h at 37oC. The amount of formazan was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm. The higher the absorbance value, the more converted formazan is present, and so the higher the number of viable cells. This method was carried out in triplicates. The data obtained using microplate reader (ThermoFisher) was used to calculate the percentage of viable and unviable cells. The formulas used (Wan Chik et al., 2010) were in equations (1) and (2) below. Where the value of the optical density (OD) sample is the OD for the cells treated with active fractions and the OD control is the OD for cells without treatment. Phytochemical Screening Phenol was detected using Ferric Chloride test (Ahluwalia and Raghav, 1997). Flavonoids were detected using Alkaline Reagent test (Evans, 2002), and Ammonia test (Harborne, 1998). Alkaloids were detected by Wagner’s test (Harborne, 1998). Saponins were detected by Sulphuric Acid Reaction test and Emulsion Formation test (Brain and Turner, 1975). Terpenoids were detected by Salkowski test (Ayoola et al., 2008) and Liebermann-Burchard test (Kumar et al., 2010). Fixed oils and fats were detected by oil stain test (Kokate et al., 2008) and finally, Cardiac Glycosides was detected by Keller Killiani test (Ayoola et al., 2008)."," C. nutans Extraction and Fractionation  Table 1 presents the results for extraction and fractionation. The hexane/ethyl acetate at a ratio of 7:3 resulted in four separate spots on the TLC plate. For further separation by open column chromatography, ratio 7:3 has been chosen as mobile phase due to the suitable RF-value showing well-separated spots with RF-value from 0.34 to 0.93, polarity index of 1.86 suggested that there is a preeminent separation of the C. nutans extract. This is because it would be easier to collect the fractions during the open column chromatography analysis when the spots are not close to each other. For column chromatography, separated fractions were collected in 15 mL centrifuge tubes and were labeled with number 1 to 77 and proceed to vacuum concentrator. Again, TLC was used to monitor the effectiveness of the separation. Fractions with similar RF-value were group together. In this case, based on the RF-value, tube number 1 to 6 were group together and named as compound/fraction 1 (F1) (RF-value = 0.93), tube number 19-29 were fraction 2 (F2) (RF-value = 0.83), tube number 40-46 were fraction 3 (F3) (RF-value =0.59) and tube number 70-77 were fraction 4 (F4) (RF-value = 0.34). At this point, the four spots showed different RF-values because they might represent different compound, which at the same time having different polarity. Thus, phytochemical screening process takes part for further validation. Phytochemical screening of C. nutans fractions The compounds identified via phytochemical screening are tabulated in Table 2. They were evaluated based on colour formation, precipitate, froth formation, visibility of the ring formation between two layers and stain formation. The fractions revealed the presence of carotenoids (F1), triterpenes (F2), saponins (F4) and cardiac glycosides (F3) (Table 2) as secondary metabolites that might be responsible for the anti-proliferative activity of the cells. Phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, fixed oils, and fats were not detected in the fractions. IC 50  of C. nutans Fractions by MTT Assay This assay was carried out to identify the active fraction which has the anti-cancer activity and determine its IC50. In this experiment, Hep-G2 cells were treated with all four active fractions (F1 – F4) and taxol used as a standard at eight concentration intervals, ranging from 0.781 to 100 µg/mL and 0.0156 to 2 µg/mL, respectively. The active fraction that is capable of inhibiting the cells growth can be assumed to be useful in the treatment of liver cancer.For screening purpose, the percentage of cell death of all active fractions were plotted in a bar graph at the same concentration (1.56 µg/mL), and taxol at 2 µg/mL. Referring to Figure 1, among all those four fractions at concentration 1.56 µg/mL, active fraction 3 (F3) which is also preliminarily identified as cardiac-glycosides (Table 2) demonstrated the highest percentage of Hep-G2 cell death with 47.6 %.The data for the MTT assay were plotted in the graph of percentage of viable cells versus concentration (µg/mL) to identify the IC50 of each fraction and taxol. The result (Table 3) showed that F2 gave the lowest IC50 value (1.73 µg/ml), while F3 gave the IC50 of 4.51 µg/ml. The results suggesting that F2 is more potent than F3. When treated with adherent Hep-G2 cells, taxol gave the IC50 value of 0.11 µg/mL. Thus, active fraction F2 is considered to demonstrate a good result in this experiment.","RF-value is equal to the distance traveled by the substance divided by the distance traveled by the solvent. Typically, an effective solvent is one that gives RF- value in the range of 0.5-1.0 (Touchstone, 1992). It is also reported that the solvent system with the highest polarity will make the components in the mixture move along with the solvent and caused no separation observed and the RF-value will be too large. Thus, from the results in Table 1, the solvent system of hexane : ethyl acetate with ratio 7 : 3, polarity index value of 1.83 which gave the best readings of RF-values, ranging from 0.34 to 0.93 had been selected for further use in column chromatography. Later, column chromatography (CC) was used to collect the active fractions from crude of C. nutans leaves extract by gravity force. CC applied the same principles as TLC but performed at larger volume (Chik et al., 2011; Tolar and Neglia, 2003). Subsequently, phytochemical screening of the collected four active fractions was carried out to preliminary identify the type of secondary metabolites separated and isolated by CC. According to Table 2, terpenoids were isolated and collected in this experiment. This finding was supported by (Wan Chik et al., 2010; Çitoğlu and Acıkara, 2012), because of ethanol, methanol, and water led to the extraction of highly oxygenated namely polar triterpenes as well as triterpenoid and sterol glycosides. Besides, Tsado et al., (2016) used the same method and successfully extracted terpenoids from Newbouldia laevis and Crateva adansonii leaves using methanol as a solvent. Secondly, based on the phytochemical screening result (Table 2) shows that the presence of carotenoid in F1, triterpenes in F2, saponin in F3 and cardiac glycosides in F4. Referring to (Yamunadevi et al., 2011; Harborne, 1998), the combination of hexane: ethyl acetate is commonly used as the mobile phase to isolate and purify terpenoids group. Yamunadevi and co-workers (Yamunadevi et al., 2011) reported that 27 different types of terpenoids were detected by HPLTC, with RF- value range of 0.31 to 0.97. This information supports our current findings, which high possibility that the F2 is in terpenoids group.The current study shows the interest of valuable natural substance, such as terpenoids has been increasing day by day (Yamunadevi et al., 2011). Terpenoids are defined as secondary metabolites with molecular structures containing carbon backbones made up of isoprene (2-methylbuta- 1, 3-diene) units (Harborne, 1998). More than 36 000 terpenoids compounds have been identified, making terpenoids the largest class of plant metabolites. In particular, terpenoids contained in many herbal plants, with several kinds of terpenoids are already available for pharmaceutical applications today, such as taxol and artemisinin as a chemotherapy drug and malaria medicines, respectively (Yamunadevi et al., 2011). Generally, plant terpenoids are well-known to possess useful aromatic qualities (Harborne, 1998). It has been used traditionally in herbal remedies and still under investigation of the pharmaceutical function, such as antibacterial, anticancer and other therapeutic properties. Until now, there is no such study which carried out specifically on terpenoids isolated from C. nutans leaves extracted as an anticancer agent. However, the crude extract of this plant shows their anticancer properties. Fong (2015) reported that the methanol and water extracts of C. nutans leaves were cytotoxic against D24 and MM418C1 melanoma cells, MCF-7 and BT474 breast carcinoma cells. Other pharmacology properties of crude C. nutans leaves extract such as antioxidant activity, anti-proliferative activity, anti-tumour, and cytotoxic agents. This suggests that the extracts may contain the anti-cancer compound. Based on these results, terpenoids may be considered as a promising anticancer agent present in the C. nutans leaves extracts. The cytotoxicity of the fractions were further defined by determining the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The four active fractions from C. nutans leave extract were used from this experiment onwards. Initial yellow in colour of MTT assay is reduced to purple formazan in the mitochondria of living cells. The reduction will take place only when the mitochondrial reductase enzyme is active. Therefore, the conversion can be directly related to the number of viable/living cells. Through this experiment, the effectiveness of the sample in causing death to the cells can be measured by the amount of purple formazan produced after the sample treated with active fractions or taxol compared to the amounts of untreated cells (Freshney, 2010). Among all the four active fractions of C. nutans leaves extract, F3 showed the highest percentage of Hep-G2 cells death (47.6 %) at 1.56 µg/mL, while taxol gave 76.6 % at concentration 2 µg/mL. However, active fraction F2 exhibited the highest percentage of Hep-G2 cancer cells inhibition in almost every concentration tested (4 over 6 concentration tested; 1.56, 3.13, 6.25 and 25 µg/ml) than other active fractions.Later, the MTT assay results on adherent Hep-G2 cells (Figure 1) shows that F2 gave a reasonable and exceptional effect against Hep-G2 liver cancer cells because the value of F2 IC50 is in the acceptable range of suitable as cytotoxicity agent. According to the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) plant screening program, plant extract is generally considered to have in vitro cytotoxicity activity if the IC50 value is less than 20 µg/mL (Boik, 2001). The F2 fraction gave an IC50 value higher than taxol but still lesser than 20 µg/mL, supporting a milder effect of native-based product compared to highly, toxic taxol. Several papers on C. nutans leaves extract showed that the crude extract possesses potential anticancer agents towards cultured cancer cell lines such as HeLa and K-562 cells (Arullappan et al., 2014) and Raji lymphoma cells (Yong et al., 2013) but those studies did not identify the type of secondary metabolites responsible for the anti-cancer activity. While, from a phytochemical screening test of this study, an isolated active fraction from crude C. nutans leaves extract, F2 showed positive results towards Lieberman-Burchard reagent, indicated that this compound possibly triterpenoid. Triterpenoid is a well-known secondary metabolite compound that possesses such anticancer properties. Triterpenoid derived from avocado showed a positive result on Hep-G2 liver cancer cells, suggesting the in vitro cytotoxicity of triterpenoid (Abubakar et al., 2017). The same study also reported that triterpenoid was also safe to normal Vero cells (Abubakar et al., 2017). Many triterpenoids have various biological activities, e.g., anti-tumour, anti-viral, anti-bacterial, virostatic, anti-ulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory (Dzubak et al., 2006). Triterpenoids are used for medicinal purposes in many Asian countries for anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, hepatoprotective, cardiotonic, sedative and tonic effects (Moses et al., 2014). An increasing number of triterpenoids have been reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against a variety of in vitro cancer cells (MCF-7 breast cancer cells, Hep-G2 liver cancer cells) without manifesting any toxicity in normal cells (Vero cells) ( Moses et al., 2014).In conclusion, the triterpenoids isolated from C. nutans were able to show the positive anti-proliferative effect on Hep-G2 liver cancer cells. Thus, C. nutans is a potential alternative or complementary medicine for treating liver cancer in a human.",

Inefficientdrugs, their adverse effects, and the development of drug resistance make itdifficult to curb the growing incidence of pancreatic cancer. Against thisbackdrop, the development new drug regimens with no or negligible adverse effectsis imperative. We assessed the anticancer effects of a plant-derivedsesquiterpene - matricine - against capan-2 pancreatic cancer cells. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. AO/EB, DAPI, and annexin V/PIstaining were used to detect apoptosis. Transwell assays were used for monitoringof cell migration and invasion. Immunoblotting was used to examine the expressionof proteins. RESULTS The results showed that matricine halted the proliferationof capan-2 cells, with minimal toxic effects on normal pancreatic cells. Theanticancer effects were due to the induction of apoptotic cell death, which wasallied with activation of caspases 3 and 9, upregulation of Bax, anddownregulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, matricine suppressed the migration andinvasive abilities of pancreatic cancer cells at IC50. We also assessed theeffects of matricine on the mTOR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. We found thatmatricine efficiently blocked this pathway, suggesting the anticancer potentialof matricine. CONCLUSIONS Matricine induced antiproliferative effects in capan-2human pancreatic cancer cells through inducing apoptosis, caspase activation,inhibition of cell migration and invasion, and blocking the mTOR/PI3K/AKTsignalling pathway.","Fang, Kaifeng, Wang, Li, Chen, LuJia, Liu, Tao, Fang, Zhi",2019,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental andclinical research,2,False,False,True,"Natural products have played an important role in curbing the incidence of cancer throughout the world. About half of the currently known anticancer drugs are derived from natural resources. Drugs such as podophyllotoxin and Taxol are natural products and are currently used in the treatment of devastating cancers. Most anticancer drugs of natural origin come from plants. Plants are always exposed to extremes of the environmental stresses and can’t walk away from them. In response to the environmental stress and have evolved to cope with extreme conditions by synthesizing a wide diversity of chemical scaffolds, often referred to as secondary metabolites. Although plant extracts were initially directly used for the treatment of ailments, with the advances in science and technology, the pure compounds isolated from plants are being used in the treatment of diseases as deadly as cancer. Based on the structure of these chemical entities, they have been classified into different groups. Sesquiterpene is one such group of metabolites that is ubiquitously found across the plant kingdom and have been shown to exhibit promising bioactivities. Sesquiterpenes from several plants have shown the capacity to inhibit the proliferation of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and gastric cancer.In the present study we assessed the effects of matricine, a naturally occurring sesquiterpene of plant origin, against gemcitabine-resistant Capan-2 human pancreatic carcinoma cells and non-cancerous hTRET-HPNE pancreatic cells. Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers. In China and the United States, it is ranked as the seventh and fourth major causes of cancer related deaths, respectively. It has been reported that pancreatic cancer affects 2.5 million people in the United States alone. The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is the worst among all cancers. Chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer has a number of adverse effects, and pancreatic cancer cells easily develop drug resistance, making it even more difficult to manage. Moreover, pancreatic cancer frequently relapses and may also become drug resistant, making it difficult to manage. Herein, we for the first time report the anticancer effects of matricine against capan-2 gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic carcinoma cells. The results showed that matricine inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer via induction of mitochondrial apoptosis and suppresses cell migration and invasion. Therefore, matricine may prove beneficial in the development of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.erH","The pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-2, and HeLa, the normal cell line hTRET-HPNE, were obtained from the Cancer Research Institute of Beijing (Beijing, China) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Life Technologies, MA),100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 U/ml penicillin G (Himedia, PA) in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.Briefly, at around 70% confluence, the Capan-2 and the hTRET-HPNE cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with 0–640 μM of matricine. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were incubated with MTT for 4 h. After this, the medium was removed and the colored formazan product was solubilized by 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. The viability of the capan-2 and the hTRET-HPNE cells was then determined by measuring absorbance at 570 nm.The Capan-2 cells were grown in 6-well plates (0.6×106 cells/well) and incubated for 12 h. The Capan-2 cells were subjected to matricine treatment at various levels (0, 10, 20, and 40 μM) for 24 h at 37°C. As the cells sloughed off, 25 μl cell cultures were put onto glass slides and stained with DAPI or a solution of AO and EB. The slides were then covered with a cover slips and examined with a fluorescent microscope (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The annexin V/PI staining was then performed as previously described.The migration and invasion abilities of Capan-2 cells were examined by Transwell chamber assay. In brief, 1×104 Capan-2 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of the Transwell device (8-μm pore size polycarbonate filters) and treated with a 20-μM concentration of matricine. This was followed by transfer into 24-well plates and incubation at 37°C for 48 h. For the invasion assay, the inserts were coated with extracellular matrix gel (50 μl) (ECM, Sigma, USA). Swabbing was performed to remove the non-migrated and non-invaded cells from the upper surface, while the migrated and invaded cells on the lower surface were subjected to fixation with methanol for about 35 min, followed by staining with crystal violet (0.5%) for about 50 min, then subjected to washing with PBS and finally counted under a light microscope (5 fields).The Capan-2 cells were harvested and subjected to washing with ice-cold PBS. The pellets were then suspended in lysis buffer at 4°C and then incubated at 95°C. Thereafter, the protein content of each cell extract was checked by Bradford assay. About 40 μg of protein was loaded from each sample and separated by SDS-PAGE before being shifted to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were then subjected to treatment with TBS and exposed to primary antibodies at 4°C. Thereafter, the cells were treated with appropriate secondary antibodies and the proteins of interest were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent.The experiments were performed in triplicate and data are shown as mean ±SD. Statistical analysis was done using the t test with GraphPad prism 7 software. Values of p<0.05 were regarded as statistically significant differences.","The growth-inhibitory effects of matricine (Figure 1A) were examined on the capan-2 pancreatic cancer cells and the normal hTRET-HPNE cells by MTT assay at concentrations ranging from 0 to 640 μM. Matricine was found to halt the growth of capan-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1B). The IC50 of matricine against capan-2 cells was 20 μM. On the other hand, the effects of matricine on proliferation of TRET-HPNE cells were negligible. The IC50 of matricine against the normal hTRET-HPNE cells was 80 μM (Figure 1C).Apoptosis in matricine-treated Capan-2 cells was determined by DAPI staining. It was quite evident from DAPI staining that the percentage of apoptotic cells increased with increase in the concentration of matricine (Figure 2). Moreover, AO/EB staining showed that the red fluorescent capan-2 cells increased upon treatment with matricine, indicative of apoptosis (Figure 3). The annexin V/PI staining of the matricine-treated cells showed that the apoptotic capan-2 cells increased from 1.2% in control to 48.4% at 40 μM of matricine (Figure 4). The apoptosis of the matricine-treated capan-2 cells was further validated by examining the levels of apoptosis-related proteins by Western blot analysis, showing that Matricine activated caspase-3 and -9 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, the expression of Bax was increased but expression of Bcl-2 was decreased by matricine treatment (Figure 5).Next, the effects of matricine on the migration and invasion of capan-2 cancer cells were investigated by Transwell assays. The results showed that at IC50, matricine inhibited the migration of capan-2 cancer cells (Figure 6). A similar trend was observed with cell invasion (Figure 7).Next, we assessed the effects of matricine on the mTOR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway of capan-2 pancreatic cancer cells. We found that matricine caused a significant decline in the expression of mTOR, PI3K, and AKT. These inhibitory effects of matricine exhibited a dose-dependent trend. Further, matricine also inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR, PI3K, and AKT in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 8).","Pancreatic carcinoma is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers throughout the world. The adverse effects of treatment strategies and the unavailability of therapeutic targets are the main obstacles that limit its treatment. Moreover, the emergence of drug resistance in pancreatic cancer cells makes it very difficult to treat pancreatic cancer with existing drugs. Plants are a diverse repository of chemical entities that may prove to be essential in the development of safer chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In the present study we assessed the anticancer effects of matricine, a plant-derived sesquiterpene, against capan-2 pancreatic cancer cells and normal pancreatic HTRET-HPNE cells. We found that matricine exerted dose-dependent growth effects on the capan-2 cells. However, matricine showed minimal toxic effects on normal HTRET-HPNE cells. These results are in agreement with investigations in which Sesquiterpenes from the clove plant were shown to suppress the growth of cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that plant-derived anticancer molecules exert their anticancer effects via multiple mechanisms such as apoptosis, autophagy, and cell cycle arrest. We performed DAPI and AO/EB staining of matricine capan-2 cells, showing that matricine treatment causes apoptotic cell death of Capan-2 pancreatic cancer cells. Annexin V/PI staining also showed that the apoptotic cell percentage increased with increased concentrations of matricine. Apoptosis is an essential process to eliminate cancer cells to maintain tissue homeostasis and is indicative of the potential of matricine as an anti-cancer agent. Moreover, the matricine-induced apoptosis was also accompanied by activation of caspases 3 and 9, upregulation of Bax, and decreased levels of Bcl-2. Cell migration and invasion are pre-requisites for metastasis of cancer cells. Herein, we investigated whether matricine has any apparent effect on migration and invasion of Capan-2 pancreatic cancer cells by Transwell assays. Interestingly, we found that matricine significantly suppressed the migration and invasion abilities of capan-2 cells. The mTOR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is one of the essential therapeutic targets for anticancer drugs owing to the involvement of this pathway in the development, progression, and tumorigenesis of cancers. We found that matricine efficiently blocks this pathway in cancer cells, indicative of the potential of matricine as an anticancer drug.","Matricine inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer with minimal toxicity to normal cells. Matricine triggered apoptosis and inhibited the migration and invasion abilities of pancreatic cancer cells via PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade. Therefore, matricine shows potential in the development of new chemotherapy drugs, but more research on this topic is needed."
46,TA037589,10.3390/md8061731,"In situ aquaculture methods for Dysidea avara (Demospongiae, Porifera) in thenorthwestern Mediterranean.","Marine sponges produce secondary metabolites that can be used as a natural sourcefor the design of new drugs and cosmetics. There is, however, a supply problemwith these natural substances for research and eventual commercialisation of theproducts. In situ sponge aquaculture is nowadays one of the most reliable methodsto supply pharmaceutical companies with sufficient quantities of the targetcompound. In this study, we focus on the aquaculture of the sponge Dysidea avara(Schmidt, 1862), which produces avarol, a sterol with interesting pharmaceuticalattributes. The soft consistency of this species makes the traditional culturemethod based on holding explants on ropes unsuitable. We have tested alternativeculture methods for D. avara and optimized the underwater structures to hold thesponges to be used in aquaculture. Explants of this sponge were mounted onhorizontal ropes, inside small cages or glued to substrates. Culture efficiencywas evaluated by determination of sponge survival, growth rates, and bioactivity(as an indication of production of the target metabolite). While the cage methodwas the best method for explant survival, the glue method was the best one forexplant growth and the rope method for bioactivity.","de Caralt, Sonia, Sánchez-Fontenla, Javier, Uriz, María J, Wijffels, Rene H",2010,Marine drugs,2,False,False,True,"Since the beginnings of the marine chemical ecology in the 1940s sponges turned out to be interesting organisms to study for commercial applications. Sponges contain secondary metabolites, which play important ecological roles in nature such as deterring fish from predation or inhibiting settlement and growth of foulants and have been shown to have biomedical properties. Many secondary metabolites from sponges have been reported to inhibit cellular growth and are therefore interesting natural products for obtaining new drugs against cancer. Lately, new pharmacological properties of sponge secondary metabolites have been discovered, such as their capacity to inhibit the nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB), which is one of the principal inducible transcriptional factors that plays a critical role in cancer development and in inflammation (see Folmer, for a review on NF-κB inhibitors). This recent discovering makes sponges, even more interesting targets in the drug discovery field than previously thought.The sponge Dysidea avara produces the sesquiterpene hydroquinone avarol and its corresponding quinone avarone. These secondary metabolites are cytostatic agents with potent anti-leukemic, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory activities. Recently, the NF-κB inhibitor activity of avarol has been described and might have an essential function in these observed anti-viral and anti-cancer activities. Moreover, avarol presents a moderate antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, and anti-fungal activities against a limited range of microorganisms. Furthermore, it inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and also is the main component (e.g., 60–98 wt.%) of a skin cream for treating psoriasis.Unfortunately, enormous quantities of avarol, higher than what can be found in the natural sponge populations, are necessary for its pharmaceutical applications. To overcome this supply problem, different approaches have been assayed. The biomedical potential of Dysidea avara has generated a wide variety of studies about different culture techniques based on this sponge species. Attempts to establish cell cultures of D. avara have also been performed based on both cell suspensions and cell aggregates (primmorphs). Another original ex situ method, which showed high survival and growth rates, was to grow sponge juveniles from larvae. Although the results obtained until now are encouraging, more investigation is required to make the ex situ culture methods a real possibility to produce the secondary metabolites in sufficient quantities to meet the market needs. On the other hand, the private enterprise KliniPharm GmbH is culturing D. avara in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea by holding explants on ropes to obtain avarol for the market (http://www.klinipharm.com). However, only few growth data of those farmed explants have been published. Although at present the most reliable method to culture sponges is in situ aquaculture more studies are required to optimize the whole process.Sponge aquaculture was originally based on the practice to culture bath sponges (i.e., genera Coscinoderma, Hippospongia and Spongia) by holding sponge cuttings on ropes. Bath sponges have a keratose skeleton made of a network of spongine fibres providing them with a consistent structure. When culturing other sponge species that have less structural elements with a less resistant skeleton it is more appropriate to use meshes instead of ropes.In this study three different in situ experimental culture methods for growing Dysidea avara (Schmidt, 1862) have been tested in order to select the best one to be applied in large-scale aquaculture. D. avara is a softer sponge with a more fragile skeleton in comparison to bath sponges. We have cut explants and hold them on horizontal ropes, placed them in individual cages, and glued them to horizontal substrates, respectively. As a control, we also monitored growth and survival of untouched individuals in the same experimental zone. The success of the culture technique was not only evaluated by survival and growth of the sponges but also by evaluating the production of the target metabolite (bioactivity). The secondary metabolite production can vary due to both external and internal factors and farming structures used to support sponges can affect their metabolite production. Thus, survival, growth, and bioactivity of D. avara explants have been monitored along the year in the three above mentioned culture methods.","The study was carried out in the western Mediterranean Sea at the locality of l’Escala, North-East of Spain (GPS coordinates: 42° 06.863’N, 003° 10.116’E) from 5 to 20 m of depth on a rocky bottom. This area was selected because of the abundance of Dysidea avara, what is an indicator of the good conditions of this area for the sponge culture.A total of 75 large Dysidea avara, from 500 to 2,000 cm3 in size, living at 12–14 m of depth, were targeted as donor individuals. From them, a sponge fragment, c.a. 28 cm3 in size, was cut from each donor without removing the donor from its substrate. In order to minimize manipulation, the explants were submitted to the three experimental treatments (N = 25), immediately after collection, which consisted in i) to hang the sponges from ropes, ii) to place them within perforated cages or iii) to attach the sponges by glue on rigid frames (50 × 50 cm). All the treatments were placed 8 m deep in close proximity to a D. avara natural population.The rope method used in this study is similar to that already used by other authors, where a rope was inserted in a large needle and carefully passed through the sponge tissue. The ropes with the explants where placed horizontally, anchored to the rigid frames (Figure 1A). In the second method we placed each explant inside a 6 × 6 × 5 cm cage. The cages were made of a rigid 1 cm mesh size, plastic net to ensure seawater flow through the cages (Figure 1B). The third method consisted of gluing the explants to a horizontal steel frame with a non-toxic, two components resin (IVEGOR) (Figure 1C). Cages, frames and ropes were all placed at a distance of 40 cm from the sea bottom.The study started in winter when the seawater low temperature favours survival during the critical period of explant attachment.The cultured explants and the controls where monitored once a month for survival and at months six and ten for growth, during ten months, taking underwater pictures of each individual. Explant survival, recovery from eventual damage, and growth were estimated from the pictures. The cage cover was opened before taking pictures of the explants cultured inside cages. Bioactivity was only analysed at the end of the culture.Survival rate (S) was calculated as the percentage of explants, which were alive at one monitoring time (Nt) divided by the living sponge explants at the previous month (Nt + 1):Growth was measured as the increase in volume (V) of explants. The size of each explant was calculated by multiplying its projected area by its mean height. The mean height was computed as the average of 5 measurements (taking into account also digitations). The sponge projected area and the mean height was derived from pictures by using image analysis (NIH Image program). Growth rates at six and ten months of culture (V6 or 10) were calculated as the percentage of the volume at month “6” and “10” with respect to the explant initial volume (V0):The error associated with the method used to calculate the explant growth prevents us from considering it as the real growth of Dysidea avara. However, the measurements can safely be used for comparison among the three culture techniques. The donor individuals (manipulation control) were not measured as for growth rates because of their much more complex shape with respect to that of the explants, which makes comparisons useless.To quantify the natural toxicity of the samples we used the Microtox® (Microbics, Carlsbad, CA, USA), a standardised method previously described. This method measures light production by the bioluminescent bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum, and detects bioluminescence decreasing when the bacteria are put in contact with the crude extracts of D. avara. Previous studies have reported an accurate positive relationship between concentration of avarol and Microtox-measured toxicity.At the end of the culture (ten months), the explants from the treatments and the control were taken to the laboratory. The samples were freeze-dried. An amount of 0.25 g of sample was squeezed in a mortar and extracted with dicloromethanol/methanol (1:1). Once the solvent was evaporated, the crude extract was weighed and resuspended through sonication in artificial seawater for the toxicity analyses by Microtox®. Toxicity was assayed at an initial concentration of 5 mg/mL of sponge dry weight. In every assay, a control and four decreasing concentrations (with a dilution factor of two) were tested after incubation of 5 min at 15 °C (temperature at which bacteria are active and produce bioluminescence). With these measures, a regression analysis on log/log scale between concentrations of crude extract and output of light was recorded. The EC50 value indicated in the regression equation is the concentration of crude extract that produces 50% in light decrease, which is assumed to represent the death of 50% of phosphorescent bacteria. The value 100/EC50 was calculated for each sample and used as measurement of toxicity.Survival was analyzed using the “life tables” statistics. Significant differences between size-classes were assessed by “Comparing Survival in Multiple Groups”. Then, comparison between each pair of size-classes was performed using the Gehan-Wilcoxon test. Mean growth rates after six and ten months were analysed by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test because data did not comply with the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions required for parametric analyses. Differences in toxicity between specimens cultured under the three culture methods and wild specimens were analysed by One-way ANOVAs after checking the data for accomplishment of the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions (Statistica 6.0 package).","Survival of explants was significantly different in the three culture methods used (p < 0.05, comparing survival in multiple groups (Figure 2). At the end of the culture (10 months), the explants placed in cages presented the highest survival (ca. 70% after 10 months of culture). The glued explants had an intermediate survival (ca. 40%), and the explants hold in ropes showed the lowest survival rates (11%). It is important to remark that for the explants hold in ropes the first month of culture was critical. After ten days the explants on ropes were reduced to a half, and at day 30, explant survival had already decreased to 38%.The mortality of the explants glued to the frame and hanged from ropes was mainly due to specimen losses because of the high water turbulence. In contrast, the cage method avoided individual removing and probably enhanced protection against predators. All the specimens of Dysidea avara used to obtain the explants (donors) survived until the end of the monitoring (ten months) and appeared healthy.Although positive growth rates were registered at the end of the culture (after ten months), growth rates varied depending on the method tested (Figure 3).After six months of culture, there were no significant differences among the three culture methods (p > 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test); however the explants cultured on ropes presented the lowest mean growth rate (ca. 40%), while the explants cultured in cages or glued to the frame presented similarly high growth rates (166.75 ± 34.62% and 167.23 ± 42.7; mean ± standard error, respectively). The explants placed in cages attached to the plastic net quite fast and after some weeks some of them grew out of the cage (Figure 4).At the end of the culture (ten months), significant differences between the three tested culture methods were found (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test). It is remarkable that the explants glued on the frame have increased notably in size, reaching the highest mean growth rates (468.9 ± 83.72%), while the explants cultured inside cages maintained the mean growth rate (142.34 ± 30.47%) monitored after six months of culture. On the other hand, the explants cultured on ropes, for which the lowest growth rates were recorded at month six, have grown notably after month ten (145.25 ± 79.06%), equalling the growth rate of the explants cultured in cages.At the end of the experiment, the explant toxicity was significantly different in the three experimental cultures (p < 0.05, One-way ANOVA; Figure 5). The explants growing in cages presented the lowest toxicity, while the ones hanging from ropes showed the highest toxicity (p < 0.05, Fisher LSD post hoc test). The explants glued to the frame presented similar toxicity to the control specimens (p > 0.05, Fisher LSD post hoc test).","Dysidea avara explants cultured in cages showed the highest survival along the whole experiment probably due to the combination of several factors: (1) the relative low manipulation of those explants; (2) the impossibility of losing explants from the cages, and (3) the physical protection against potential predators. In particular, the cages avoided the high mortality due to individual losses, which occurs during the critical phase of attachment (first weeks of culture). The severity of this period depends on the species capability for attaching to the new substrate (e.g., cage, rope, and resin) and can be enhanced by a high level of sponge manipulation. Conversely, the sponges cultured on ropes presented a high mortality (ca. 70%) during the first 30 days because they show a particular difficulty to attach to the rope. On the other hand, the glued explants experienced an intermediate level of manipulation (less than the rope cultured explants and more than the ones placed in cages) what probably explains their middle mortality rates.We observed that the high water flow present in our study area, although suitable for the sponge growth, becomes a critical factor for survival of explants on ropes due to substrate instability and the associated reduction in attachment success. In our study area (8 m of depth) the water flow ranges from 0.05 to 0.15 m/s, and occasionally peacks to 0.66 m/s. These water flow conditions are comparable to the ones described by Duckworth and Battershill in an exposed site (from 0.19 to 46 m/s) where two sponge species (Polymastia croceus and Latrunculia wellingtonensis) where cultured by several different methods at 12 m deep. Duckworth and Battershill (2003) also found that strong water movement tore some explants off the rope, leading to survival rates of 59% and 22%, after nine months of culture for P. croceus and L. wellingtonensis, respectively. Moreover, explants cultured in cages at the end of the experiment (ten months) had survival rates (ca. 77%) comparable to those after nine months of P. croceus and L. wellingtonensis, cultured in mesh (96% and 61%, respectively).Survival rates depend on the species features. It has been speculated that the spongine contents of the sponge tissue plays an important role in the capability of regeneration and potential attachment of the target sponge; conversely the sponges with spicule skeletons and low collagen content have less capability to recover from manipulation and have more difficulties for attaching to the new substrate. Dysidea avara is a relatively elastic sponge but has not as much spongine as bath sponges (e.g., Spongia officinalis), what makes alternative culture methods as cages or glue, more suitable (higher survival) than ropes for the farmers.As for explant growth, gluing the explants to horizontal solid substrates such a metallic frame seemed to be the best method to culture Dysidea avara in the sea. At the end of the experiment (ten months) the explants glued to the substrate had the largest final size. This huge growth rate, which can be considered high when compared with that of other cultured sponges (Table 3 in), has to be taken with care because of the method used for growth measuring. The high growth recorded may be a consequence of the non-invasive nature of the gluing method and the lower stress it produced to the sponges, compared with cages and ropes. Moreover, the glue provides a new artificial substrate, which seems to be suitable for a faster and easy attachment of the explants.The caged sponges, despite the low manipulation they suffered, showed similarly low growth rates to the ones cultured by ropes at the end of the experiment. This low growth rate can be attributed to several causes. The initial high growth rate could be favoured by the presence of the new substrate (i.e., the rigid net); however after the explant tissue engulfed the net, no longer substrate was available to extend on. On the other hand, fouling organisms, settled after some months of culture on the net-made cages, reduced water flow through the caged sponge. This flow reduction may represent a trophic depletion for the sponge, which may have hampered growth.Some generalization can be envisaged as for Dysidea avara growth: high growth rates have been recorded with the three methods assayed, but high growth variability has also been recorded among explants cultured under the same method. Thus intraspecific growth variability seems to be a common feature to both sponges under culture and wild specimens The relatively high growth rates obtained for the cultured sponges compared with the previous reported values for other species are probably due firstly to the particular species dynamism but secondly to the favourable hydrodynamics of the zone (e.g., strong water flow and high concentration of food particles in the water). Other authors have already stated that water flow intensity can greatly affect the growth of cultured sponges. In particular, high water movement generally promotes high growth through increased food availability.The lowest bioactivity presented by the explants cultured in cages is coincident with the low growth rates shown by these explants, which might be the result of a lower water flow across the cages and a consequent reduction of the available food for the explants. In contrast, the highest bioactivity was shown by explants handling from ropes, which is maybe due to the higher stress that this unstable substrate produced on the sponges.The explants glued to the substrate presented a similar bioactivity to the wild specimens, which points to this method as the best culture method for Dysidea avara culture, when obtaining secondary metabolites is attempted. However, investigation on the exact environmental factors that enhance metabolite production should be addressed before a culture method can be seriously proposed.","When we consider survival, growth, and bioactivity of the cultured sponges altogether, it is made evident that the three variables are not positively correlated. While cages represent the best method for explant survival, gluing the explants is the best method for obtaining the highest growth and handling the explants from ropes produced the highest bioactivity. In our case, with all the results at hand, we will recommend to culture Dysidea avara explants with the glue method. Despite glued explants presented a higher mortality than the ones cultured in cages, their growth rates and their bioactivity compensated those losses. Moreover, for this species and under the environmental conditions assayed, we can propose the sponge aquaculture as a suitable alternative to harvesting those sponges from natural populations.The results of our assays indicate that it is highly important to select the most appropriate method, before starting a sponge culture. The best method will depend on the sponge species and the environmental characteristics of the culture location. This implies a previous knowledge of the biology and physiology (e.g., elasticity, recovery capability, growth) of the target species and the environmental conditions of the selected zone (e.g., water flow, T, etc.). A consensus between survival and growth must be achieved because generally the conditions that increase sponge growth (e.g., high water flow) are also the ones that increase explant mortality. Moreover, increasing the production of secondary metabolites of the sponges under culture has also to be considered. Finally, sponge growth rates were very different at six months that at ten months, which highlights the necessity of long-term experimental cultures for providing an accurate overview of the culture development. This especially applies when the target species are sponges with important variations in growth rates and mortality with time."
47,TA047353,10.1371/journal.pone.0238532,The potential antimalarial efficacy of hemocompatible silver nanoparticles fromArtemisia species against P. falciparum parasite.,"Malaria represents one of the most common infectious diseases which becoming animpellent public health problem worldwide. Antimalarial classical medicationsinclude quinine-based drugs, like chloroquine, and artesunate, a derivative ofartemisinin, a molecule found in the plant Artemisia annua. Such therapeutics arevery effective but show heavy side effects like drug resistance. In this study,""green"" silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been prepared from two Artemisiaspecies (A. abrotanum and A. arborescens), traditionally used in folk medicine asa remedy for different conditions, and their potential antimalarial efficacy havebeen assessed. AgNPs have been characterized by UV-Vis, dynamic light scatteringand zeta potential, FTIR, XRD, TEM and EDX. The structural characterization hasdemonstrated the spheroidal shape of nanoparticles and dimensions under 50 nm,useful for biomedical studies. Zeta potential analysis have shown the stabilityand dispersion of green AgNPs in aqueous medium without aggregation. AgNPshemocompatibility and antimalarial activity have been studied in Plasmodiumfalciparum cultures in in vitro experiments. The antiplasmodial effect has beenassessed using increasing doses of AgNPs (0.6 to 7.5 μg/mL) on parasitized redblood cells (pRBCs). Obtained data showed that the hemocompatibility of AgNPs isrelated to their synthetic route and depends on the administered dose. A.abrotanum-AgNPs (1) have shown the lowest percentage of hemolytic activity onpRBCs, underlining their hemocompatibility. These results are in accordance withthe lower levels of parasitemia observed after A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) treatmentrespect to A. arborescens-AgNPs (2), and AgNPs (3) derived from a classicalchemical synthesis. Moreover, after 24 and 48 hours of A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1)treatment, the parasite growth was locked in the ring stage, evidencing theeffect of these nanoparticles to hinder the maturation of P. falciparum. Theanti-malarial activity of A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) on pRBCs was demonstrated to behigher than that of A. arborescens-AgNPs (2).","Avitabile, Elisabetta, Senes, Nina, D'Avino, Cristina, Tsamesidis, Ioannis, Pinna, Alessandra, Medici, Serenella, Pantaleo, Antonella",2020,PloS one,2,False,False,True,"Malaria represents one of the most diffused human diseases caused by the mosquito bite, which is able to generate infection by introducing different species of Plasmodium into the host. Among them, P. falciparum represents the most dangerous and lethal parasite infecting humans. However, by considering the current drugs accessible for the prevention and treatment of this disease, it seems that, despite the effectiveness of available treatments, the main threat connected to malaria is the emergence of drug resistance. In this context, nanotechnology could represent a possible future solution against malaria drug resistance by introducing the control of drug release at the nanoscale or building active nanoparticles to be used against the parasite. In the last decades, the applications of nanotechnology have been mainly focused on the development of a large variety of nanoscale tools designed for their use in therapy, leading to the improvement of drug delivery strategies in order to overcame the barriers found in several conventional therapeutics. Among different nanomaterials, metal nanoparticles have been significantly studied thanks to their particular physical and chemical properties as alternative theranostic tools for treating a wide gamut of human diseases. Malaria can be one of the targets of these new strategic weapons.In this context, silver nanoparticles represent an ideal material for biomedical applications and have been largely investigated during the last years. The use of silver remedies in medicine has been a common practice until the past century, when it ceased with the discovery of antibiotics in the 1940’s. The development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, to which silver seems to be immune, renewed the interest toward this metal, and in the last few decades a large variety of silver compounds has been prepared, especially as coordination complexes, which also uncovered the great potential of silver as an anticancer, antifungal, antiparasitic and antimalarial agent. Regrettably, such compounds have been successful in in vitro experiments only, with a scarce possibility of applications in vivo due to the low bioavailability of the active species (the Ag+ ion) inside the organism when they were transferred to animal models. Still, the activity of silver-based drugs seems to be highly desirable, and the employment of AgNPs could bypass bioavailability problems, since they can act a reservoir of Ag+ ions inside the cell, released close to the molecular targets. According to the literature, silver nanoparticles are toxic for prokaryotic organisms, but relatively safe for eukaryotic species, including humans. Their cytotoxicity is associated to several characteristics, including reactivity in solution, size distribution, shape, coating/capping, etc., which in turn depend on the synthetic method used for their preparation. Indeed, conventional physical and chemical strategies for AgNPs synthesis are rather expensive, and reagents and solvents can be toxic. Thus, the preparation of eco-friendly metal nanoparticles using biological fluids represents a field of technology for nanomedicine applications which is growing with impressive speed. Generally, extracts from plants, bacteria and algae, plant-based phytochemicals, and other biological sources are used as the reducing agents in the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with high stability and low toxicity.The genus Artemisia, mainly diffused in the Northern hemisphere temperate regions, is one of the widest genera in the Asteraceae family, including more than 500 species, some of which have been traditionally used as folk remedies for the most disparate conditions, going from fever to common infections, intestinal parasites, hepatitis, and malaria. The therapeutic action of this genus of plants seems to be connected to the presence of a large variety of terpenes and thujones found in their extracts, which are currently being studied for the same applications. Artemisia annua is actually the source of artemisinin, which is one of the reference compounds, together with its derivative artesunate, in the antimalarial treatment, but also A. absinthium, A. afra, A. herba-alba, A. sieberi have been and are still widely used as antimalarial remedies. A. abrotanum, a plant probably native to Southwestern Europe and diffused in the temperate regions of Europe, Western Asia (Turkey and Armenia) and North America, also known as “southernwood”, has been employed in traditional medicine for treating a variety of disorders, including upper airway diseases, but it also showed interesting antimalarial properties. In a similar way, A. arborescens, a common species in ruderal environments on calcareous soils in the Mediterranean area, also known as “great mugwort” or “arborescent mugwort, is still used as an anti-inflammatory folk remedy; moreover, it was traditionally employed on the island of Sardinia as an infusion against malarial fevers and other diseases before the advent of modern drugs. Furthermore, several studies have reported the potential of A. arborescens compounds as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticancer agents. Following these studies, an idea emerged as to investigate and compare the effects of AgNPs grown from A. abrotanum and A. arborescens against malaria.As a matter of fact, many biologically active AgNPs have been prepared from other Artemisia sp. extracts. They all showed good antibacterial, anticancer and antifungal properties. Anyway, to the best of our knowledge, A. abrotanum extracts have been employed in the synthesis of magnesium oxide (MgO) or palladium (Pd) nanoparticles for catalytic purposes only, while A. arborescens has never been used to prepare metal nanoparticles. Considering all the advantages of “green” AgNPs and the medicinal properties of Artemisia plants, especially against malaria, the synthesis of silver nanoparticles here proposed has been carried out using these two different Artemisia species, A. abrotanum and A. arborescens, and the AgNPs thus prepared have also been compared to AgNPs from a traditional chemical reduction for their activity against P. falciparum parasite.","Unless otherwise stated, all materials were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA: silver nitrate, sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate, sodium citrate, ammonium hydroxide solution, ethanol. A. abrotanum plants were purchased from an accredited plant grower in Pulia.A. arborescens leaves were collected in a growth spot in the countryside around Sassari (Sardinia, Italy). Both species were identified by a botanist of the Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Sassari.Freshly drawn blood (Rh+) from healthy adults of both sexes was used. Patients provided written, informed consent in ASL. 1-Sassari (Azienda Sanitaria Locale.1-Sassari) center before entering the study. This study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. No ethical approval has been requested as Human blood samples were used only to sustain the parasites in vitro cultures. Blood anti-coagulated with heparin was stored in citrate-phosphate-dextrose with adenine (CPDA-1) prior to use. RBCs were separated from plasma and leukocytes by washing three times with RPMI 1640 medium. As previously reported, Plasmodium falciparum laboratory strain Palo Alto (PA), FCB1, It-G and ARS1 (all of them mycoplasma-free) were grown according to standard protocols. The Palo Alto (PA) strain represents a reference parasite strain to study various antimalarial drugs in P. falciparum. PA strain was isolated from a Ugandan patient and is considered as a reference strain due to its high genetic stability. Fresh red blood cells were selected and subsequently infected by the parasite of PA strain in order to create a continuous parasite culture of pRBCs to be used for treatments. P. falciparum PA strain (mycoplasma-free) was cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium containing HEPES, supplemented with 20 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine, 0.025 mM adenine, and 32 mg/L gentamycin at 2% hematocrit. Parasite cultures were synchronized as described by Lambros and Vanderberg. Throughout this procedure, P. falciparum cultures maintained synchronicity for 2–3 cycles.Fresh A. abrotanum and A. arborescens leaves were collected in full thriving stage, in the months of February and March. Silver nanoparticles have been prepared using a modified version of the protocol reported in the literature by Khatoon et al.. Fresh leaves were washed to remove dust and dirt, dried on paper, then weighed (10 g), manually minced and extracted (150 mL ethanol: water 1:1) for 30 minutes at the temperature of 50 °C, to avoid possible degradation of bioactive molecules. The extracts were then filtered and used to reduce silver nitrate to AgNPs. In details, 100 mL of the hydroalchoolic extracts were diluted to 500 mL with milliQ water and slowly added to 500 mL water solution of AgNO3 (340 mg) to reach a final molarity of 2 mM, under magnetic stirring at room temperature. Reaction was complete within a day. Silver nanoparticles have also been synthesized through a classical chemical approach (0.1 M AgNO3, 0.3 mM ascorbic acid as the reductant and 0.3 mM sodium citrate as the stabilizer, at 30 °C; the pH was adjusted to 13 with NH4OH to ensure a relatively small size of the synthesized nanoparticles) and used for comparison. All AgNPs were recovered by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes. The yield of the reaction depended on the number of centrifuge cycles performed, and after 6 cycles about 60% of the initial silver was recovered, while the rest remained in suspension.The plasmonic peak of AgNPs was revealed by UV-Vis spectrum of the nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous buffer samples (1 mg/mL). Spectra were recorded by a Nicolet Evolution 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The determination of the average size distribution of the nanoparticles by dynamic light scattering was performed using the Zeta sizer Nano-S90 (Malvern Panalytical) by dispersing the dried powder (1 mg) in water (1 mL). The zeta potential (ζ) of AgNPs was measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZSP (Malvern Instruments) in backscatter configuration (θ = 173°; laser wavelength of λ = 633 nm). The scattering cell temperature was fixed at 298 K, and the data were analysed through the Zetasizer software 7.03 version. Samples were prepared by suspending AgNPs (1 mg/mL) in milliQ water, left under rotation for one hour and sonicated for 20 min before analysis. Samples for Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy were prepared as KBr pellets using nanoparticles or dried plant extracts (1% m/m). FTIR measurement were performed by recording the signals in the 400–4000 cm-1 range with a resolution of 4 cm-1 on a Vertex 70 Bruker spectrophotometer and analysed with OPUS 7 software. The X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was performed on a diffractometer (SmarLab model from Rigaku) aligned in the symmetrical Bragg-Brentano configuration with a Cu rotating anode source (lambda = 1.5418 A) and a graphite monochromator in the diffracted beam. Patterns were collected in the angular range from 25° to 120° in 2-theta, with a step-size of 0.05°, counting for 4 sec at each step. The Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis (TEM) were performed on FEI TECNAI G2 F20 TWIN instrument with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) was employed to collect the spectrum of elemental composition. Samples for TEM and EDX analyses were prepared by dispersing a small amount of nanoparticles in ethanol, sonicating them for 20 or 30 min, followed by the deposition of one or two drops of the suspension on a holey carbon/copper supported grid.The pRBCs cultures previously obtained were provided in order to perform the hemolysis assay. Fresh RBCs were prepared to maintain the pRBCs cultures at 1% haematocrit. Fresh human heparinized whole blood was obtained from healthy volunteer donors. RBCs were purified from blood by centrifugation at 200 g for 5 min to remove plasma and leukocytes. RBCs were then washed three times in sterile complete growth medium as previously described. Parasitized RBCs cultures were maintained at 2–5% parasitemia (1% haematocrit) at 37 °C in a 95/5% (vol/vol) air/CO2-atmosphere. All assays were performed at this parasitemia and hematocrit. Hemolysis buffer (5 mmol/L sodium phosphate, 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0) was used as the positive control (Ctrl+), while PBS 1X and 5 mM glucose were used as the negative control (Ctrl-). To determine the hemolytic activity on pRBCs, nanoparticles suspension (stock = 1 mg/mL) prepared with sterile isotonic PBS 1X and 5 mM glucose was added to diluted pRBC culture (0.1 mL, ~ 2 × 108 cells/mL) at different concentrations (0.6, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 7.5 μg/mL) for 24 and 48 hours of incubation at 37 and 41 °C (Thermomixer). Then, samples were centrifuged at 200 g for 1 minute and a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific) was used to measure the absorbance of hemoglobin release in the supernatant. The absorbance value of hemoglobin at 600 nm was measured with the reference wavelength of 405 nm. The percent of hemolysis was calculated as follows: Hemolysis % = [(sample absorbance _ negative control)/ (positive control _ negative control)] _ 100%.1 mg/mL of silver nanoparticles was serially diluted prior to addition to malaria cultures in PBS 1X and 5 mM glucose. Untreated cultures were run in parallel with the same final concentration. Cultures at the ring stage and fresh isolates of P. falciparum were treated for 24 and 48 hours in the presence of the indicated concentrations of all the tested silver nanoparticles: A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1), A. arborescens-AgNPs (2), AgNPs (3). All compounds were freshly prepared before any experiment and used immediately.The morphology and the total parasitemia assays were performed using a standard method. Parasite viability and parasitemia of PA strain were determined using Diff-Quick stained thin blood smears and light microscopy (Carl Zeiss Standard Microscope Lamphouse 467230). Parasitemia was defined as the number of parasites/number of RBCs counted, for a total of 5000 RBCs. Two thin smears per condition were counted 3 separate times by each of three operators. Cultures were synchronized weekly using Percoll separation or 5% sorbitol solution treatment in order to obtain the first parasite stage (rings) to start the experiments at 0 h. The experiments were carried out at least in triplicate.To calculate the half maximal inhibitory concentrations of the different silver nanoparticles, ICEstimator software version 1.2 was used. The program estimates IC50 values using a nonlinear regression function of the R software.Data analyses were performed using Prism GraphPad software. Statistics for experiments were performed using a t-test. In all cases * was used for p < 0.05, ** for p < 0.01, and *** for p < 0.001. Values were expressed as the mean ± SD. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate.","“Green” AgNPs have been prepared from leaf extracts using a modified method for analogous AgNPs from A. annua (different extracts-to-silver ratio) as summarised in (Fig 1), which shows the synthetic process using the two different species of Artemisia plants. This change was introduced in the attempt of preparing particles with a small size (under 50 nm) useful for biological applications. However, we need to consider t that AgNPs can cause hemolysis, which was found to be size- and dose-dependent, being higher for very small nanoparticles. Cell uptake is also correlated to the nanoparticle size, being optimal for middle-sized AgNPs, around 50 nm.The characterization of AgNPs synthetized using Artemisia leaf extract was carried out by a series of spectroscopic analyses. The UV-Vis spectra show the AgNPs surface plasmon resonance effect which reflects the method of synthesis, in turn affecting nanoparticle shape and size. Data results indicate that the peak observed in the range 400–450 nm was increased in A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) and A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) respect to “classical” AgNPs (3), suggesting a spheroidal shape for these nanoparticles with a size below 50 nm (Fig 2). Contrarily, “classical” AgNPs (3) displayed a lower absorbance intensity, probably due to their aggregation in solution (Fig 2). Dynamic light scattering analyses were used to evaluate the size distribution of AgNPs in aqueous dispersion. The average hydrodynamic size of “green” nanoparticles was around 37 nm for A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1), and 30 nm for A. arborescens-AgNPs (2), respectively (Fig 3A and 3B). All “green” nanoparticles were well dispersed in aqueous medium showing no aggregation in solution. On the other hand, AgNPs (3) from the classical chemical reduction appeared to be rather aggregated. However, dynamic light scattering analyses revealed their average size to be around 60 nm (Fig 3C). In order to describe the nanoparticles stability in acqueous medium, zeta potential analysis was performed. A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) and A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) have shown a good zeta potential value (Fig 3D) underlining their good dispersion in aqueous medium without aggregation (S2 and S3 Figs). Contrariwise, “classical” AgNPs (3) displayed a low zeta potential value (-2.9 ± 0.3) (Fig 3D and S4 Fig) evidencing their propensity to aggregation in accordance with the other characterization results reported.The evaluation of the structural features of the nanoparticle surface plays a significant role in the understanding of the possible effects of AgNPs on the cell membrane for biological applications.FT-IR spectra (Fig 4A) were recorded to evaluate the surface capping of the “green” compared to “classical” nanoparticles. There is a sharp difference in the aspect of the spectra for “green” respect to “classical” AgNPs (3) (Fig 4A), the former showing a number of bands which are not present in the latter, thus confirming the formation of the capping. Such peaks can be tentatively attributed to amines, proteins or polyphenolic compounds of Artemisia leaf extracts. The very broad band going from 3100 to 3600 cm-1 is encompassing the OH and NH stretching frequencies, the signals around 2900 cm-1 are due to the CH stretching mode of hydrocarbon moieties, while those around 1620 (ν C = O) are most probably due to the carbonyl group of amidic compounds (i.e. proteins and enzymes). A series of bands can be attributed to polyphenols: 2920 cm-1 (stretching of the C-H bond adjacent to a quinone moiety), 1440 cm-1 (stretching of the C = C bond adjacent to the quinone system) and 1250 cm-1 (stretching of the C = C bonds of the various coupled aromatic systems). Moreover, the band in the range 1400–1380 cm-1 may be attributed to silver nanoparticles in accordance with the literature. As for the AgNPs (3) from classical reduction, the broad band around 3400–3300 cm-1 is due to water molecules, while the peaks in the regions 1600–1500 and 1400–1300 cm-1 can be attributed to the overlapping of the COO- asymetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations, respectively, of citrate and ascorbate anions present on the nanoparticle surface.A comparison between the FTIR of the dry plant extracts and the relative AgNPs has been undertaken to add more information about the capping. The two sets of spectra are similar but not identical, showing that most but not all the biomolecules present in the plant extract have contributed to the formation of the capping (Fig 4A).The XRD patterns showed a progression of broadened line profiles which was matched with the presence of Ag metal phase with space group Fm-3m and a = 4.0853 (4 Ag atoms in the unit cell). In Fig 4B, the crystalline peaks were reported and the XRD data were in agreement with the standard JCPD file no. 04–0783. It should be noted that the pattern reported by Kathoon et al. is similar to our recorded progression. The peak profile phase was broadened on account of sensible effects due to crystallite size smallness and lattice strain. These are determined by the Rietveld program to be D = 200 A and e = 0.0023 for Ag. Finally, the samples were prepared for TEM and EDX characterization. Fig 5 shows TEM images of AgNPs, which were close to spherical shape and not fully homogenous in the size range, which anyway appeared to be regular and well below 50 nm in diameter (range 20–30 nm). Moreover, EDX profile confirmed the elemental composition by evidencing the silver peak of each kind of nanoparticle (S1 Fig). The Cu peak also present in the spectrum is due to the grid.The hemolysis assay has commonly been performed at body and fever temperature (37°C and 41°C, respectively) at concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 7.5 μg/mL up to 48 hours of incubation (Fig 6).Testing both temperature conditions is of particular interest for nanomaterials, as they should be used for therapeutic purposes, which might encounter complex states such as fever. All the tested nanomaterials presented dose-dependent hemolysis on pRBCs after the first 24 hours of incubation, except for AgNPs (3), (Fig 6). At concentration below 5 μg/mL, the hemolytic effect of all tested AgNPs was not significant, as shown in Fig 6. Contrarily, a significant hemolytic activity of the “green” nanoparticles is reported at concentration above 5 μg/mL (p < 0.01). In particular, A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) have shown an evident effect on pRBCs at 5 and 7.5 μg/mL dosage (p < 0.01 and 7 μg/mL p < 0.001 respectively for both temperature conditions) compared to A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1), probably due to the different capping and size (Fig 6). Instead, AgNPs (3) did not reveal any significant hemolytic activity in dosages below 7.5 μg/mL at physiological and fever temperature (Fig 6). Otherwise, when measured at fever temperature (41°C) a two-fold increase in hemolysis at 5 and 7.5 μg/mL dosages, compared to lower dosages (0.6, 1.25 and 2.5 μg/mL) of “green” nanoparticles, was observed (Fig 6). In this study, green nanoparticles have shown the hemolytic effects on pRBCs at high dosages (5 and 7.5 μg/mL) due to their small size and their different nature of synthesis. Previous studies have confirmed our findings that the size of AgNPs used in high dosages is a critical factor of hemolysis and especially small sized AgNPs, display a great ability to induce hemolysis in pRBCs. Contrariwise, the AgNPs (3) derived from the classical synthesis have shown low activity against parasites and low hemolytic effects probably due to their strong aggregation and their large size. Considering the non-hemolytic activity reported at low dosage of nanoparticles, the next experiments of percentage of parasitemia and morphological study on pRBCs have been performed using the intermediate dosage (2.5 μg/mL).The next experiments have been carried out using the non hemolytic concentration of nanoparticles as previously described. In particular, pRBCs were treated with increasing doses of all nanoparticles (0.6 to 7.5 μg/mL) at both 24 and 48 hours in order to evaluate the effect of parasite growth inhibition. Palo Alto (PA) has been used as a representative strain as no significant differences have been observed among the other strains tested (FCB1, It-G and ARS1). A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) and A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) have demonstrated significant in vitro activity against P. falciparum in pRBCs, showing dose-dependent hemolytic effect (Fig 6) connected to the parasite death and a consequent decrease of parasitemia (Fig 7) compared to “classical” AgNPs (3). In particular, these nanoparticles, even at low concentrations (0.6 μg/mL), presented a modest decrease in parasitemia during the first cycle of growth (24 h) and a substantial decrease in parasitemia during the second cycle (48 h) (Fig 7). Considering the evident hemolytic activity of nanoparticles at high concentration, to further evaluate the effects on parasite maturation and death a morphology investigation was performed on PA strain using the most efficient low dosage (2.5 μg/mL). In details, it was found that A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) showed antiplasmodial activity by blocking the parasite maturation stage from trophozoite to rings (Fig 8). On the contrary, A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) have demonstrated their antiplasmodial activity achieving the parasite death compared to the control after 24 and 48 hours of treatment (Fig 8). Moreover, A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) showed the best antiplasmodial activity considering the IC50,90,99 as reported in Table 1.","It is known that a critical step in biomedical applications of nanoparticles is to study their physical-chemical properties in order to correlate their biological activity to specific parameters such as composition, size, shape and capping. In this study, considering the same concentration of nanoparticles used for the analysis, the difference observed during the evaluation of each nanoparticle activity may depend on these parameters. In this context, A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) have demonstrated a lower aggregation in aqueous medium and better shape and dimension compared to the other nanoparticles taken into consideration. In order to investigate each AgNPs type effects on PA cultures, their chemical structure has been studied and correlated with their activity and biocompatibility. Indeed, to study the effect of “green” AgNPs on RBCs biocompatibility, several in vitro experiments have been performed on human pRBCs infected by P. falciparum. After the nanoparticles characterization, their hemolytic properties in contact with the human erythrocytes were studied. The increase in hemolytic activity observed is probably due to the higher temperature used for fever simulation, where the RBCs could be sensitive to the temperature of 41°C. On the other hand, based on the large hemolysis dependence on fever temperature, non-hemolytic concentrations were assessed below 5 μg/mL. It is noteworthy that after 24 hours of incubation there was no further increase of the hemolytic activity. The different hemolysis effect could be assigned to the difference in the size of nanoparticles and/or the different biomolecules present in the capping, which cannot be excluded. In fact, it has been reported that the variety of shape, size and chemistry of nanoparticles produce different effects on the biological environment.However, to further evaluate the effects on parasite maturation and death, a morphology investigation was performed on different strains of P. falciparum pRBCs. The striking morphological alteration observed in fixed blood smears of PA strain treated with A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) and A. arborescens-AgNPs (2), is again most probably linked to the small size and the different nature of synthesis using Artemisia extracts. Despite the smaller size of A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) respect to the other nanoparticles, which should confer them higher efficacy, their lower activity against the parasite may depend on the different capping from the A. arborescens plant extract used.Anyway, this method of synthesis has indeed allowed to create small size nanoparticles useful for biomedical applications connected to an effective action against P. falciparum parasite. In general, all the results gathered in this study underline the higher antiplasmodial efficacy of AgNPs from A. abrotanum extract respect to the A. arborescens ones.","The present work was performed as a pilot study in order to evaluate Artemisia sp. derived silver nanoparticles potential antimalarial efficacy in parasitized human red blood cell and to understand their efficacy against P. falciparum as a new nanotool against malaria. The obtained results have demonstrated that plant extracts derived from A. abrotanum and A. arborescens can be used for the facile biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles and to create a bio-capping on the AgNPs useful to modulate their activity against P. falciparum cultures in in vitro experiments. Results evidenced a high anti-malarial activity for A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) in compared to A. arborescens-AgNPs (2). Their hemolytic effect is dose-dependent, and is more pronounced for the smallest AgNPs, i.e. those derived from A. arborescens, as expected. The high anti-malarial activity for A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) is connected to the small size of nanoparticles and their different effect on the parasite cycle. In fact, results underlined that A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) were been able to hinder the stage of the maturation of the parasite locking it in the ring stage after treatment. The mechanism behind this behaviour is still unknown. Studies reporting the biological bases of antiprotozoal action of silver nanoparticles are very rare, so the details on the processes leading to their antiplasmodium effects are lacking and proper investigation should be undertaken as soon as possible in order to cover this important topic and allow a more efficacious research to fight malaria with these new nanoweapons. Anyhow, the study on AgNPs antibacterial properties unveiled some relevant aspects of their activity, which can be mainly connected to the generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) as the promoter of cell death mechanisms, especially via mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, together with extensive damage to the cell membrane and enzyme deactivation via silver binding (17). All these events, alone or combined, could be able to disrupt the functions of plasmodium cells, leading to the consequences observed in our experiments. Considering the data presented in this study, the antiplasmodial activity of Artemisia-derived AgNPs in in vitro experiments against P. falciparum is promising and deserves further research."

""]nan","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","[""discussion The current study describes the draft genome and transcriptomes from root, stem, leaf and flower. Both neem and citrus belong to the Order Rutales and our phylogenetic studies reaffirmed their taxonomic closeness. Additionally, phylogenetic studies grouped A. indica with the Melia species, one that is also known to harbour bioactive compounds (Figure [2b](#page-3-0)) suggesting a common evolutionary process with regard to synthesis of these compounds in Meliaceae. Repeat analysis showed low repeat content in A. indica genome compared with other sequenced angiosperms. This could have been due to the presence of xenobiotic terpenoids specific to the plant, which might have been a major impediment for horizontal gene transfer [[50](#page-12-0)]. This impediment in horizontal gene transfer could have skewed the conventional host-pathogen interactions countering the accumulation of repeats in A. indica compared to other contemporary angiosperms. Insertion times of LTR elements in neem suggest a major wave of retrotransposition about 1million years ago (Figure [3](#page-4-0)), similar to the observation made in S. bicolor [[28](#page-11-0)]. However, in A. indica the oldest insertion event date back much further than S. bicolor (13.35 million years in neem against 3 million years in Sorghum, Figure [3\\)](#page-4-0). Monocot genomes have higher GC content than dicots, which is reflected in an average difference in codon usage between them [\\[51,52](#page-12-0)]. Interestingly, like O. sativa [[53](#page-12-0)] but unlike A. thaliana and others [[54](#page-12-0)], the A. indica genome shows a bimodal distribution of GC content (Figure S11 in Additional file [2](#page-11-0)). Domesticated crop genomes with higher GC content are likely to have evolved by a relaxation of a natural selection process against higher nitrogen use in DNA due to the use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers [\\[55](#page-12-0)]. A. indica, a hardy plant, is not domesticated and can grow in poor and degraded soil including in semi-arid conditions with tolerance for high temperature [\\[56\\]](#page-12-0). Additionally, there is no history of any usage of nitrogen rich fertilizers to grow A. indica. This might have played a role in shaping the AT-rich nucleotide composition of A. indica genome. Transcript abundances of genes in A. indica correlated well with their functions in respective organs; for example, root, leaf, stem and flower showed the presence of highly expressed ones involved in ion homeostasis, photosynthesis, ion transport and ATPase activity, respectively. Unlike the genome, A. indica transcriptomes exhibited unimodal GC distribution roughly overlapping with the higher GC peak of the genome (Figure S11 in Additional file [2](#page-11-0)). The distribution of A + T in A. indica transcriptomes mapped closer to the A. thaliana transcriptome than to the ones in O. sativa or V. vinifera (Figure S11 in Additional file [2](#page-11-0)). The lengths and the GC content of the first exons and first introns are reported to be associated with functional elements in other large genomes [\\[57\\]](#page-12-0). The GC content of the first exons and first introns in A. indica were similar to that of other exons and introns in the genome (Figure [7\\)](#page-6-0). Highly expressed primary transcripts of A. indica bear longer intron structures suggesting their possible functional role in expression and conforming with the results shown in other plants [[58](#page-12-0)] and yeast [\\[59\\]](#page-12-0). Sequencing and analysis of the genome and transcriptomes of neem holds significance due to the plant's utility in agriculture and medicine. The use of botanical products as pest control and deterrence has acquired greater significance with the shifting trends in mainstream agriculture towards sustainable and organic farming. Neem provides a suitable option for developing such eco-friendly and sustainable pesticides [\\[56\\]](#page-12-0). Currently a very small percentage of farmers use neem-based products as a substitute to synthetic pesticides as the general awareness of such practices remains limited. Azadirachtin, derived from neem seed kernels, has been proved to be a potent and effective pesticide. Total chemical synthesis of azadirachtin is challenging owing to the low yield of synthesis and remains a bottleneck for commercial bulk manufacturing. Secondary metabolites synthesized by terpene synthases are the major components of essential oils and are of great economic value. In plants, synthesis of terpenes is compartmentalized into monoterpenes and diterpenes (as well as carotenoids and chlorophylls) that are produced via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway in the plastids while the sesquiterpenes and triterpenes are made in the cytosol via the mevalonate pathway [[60](#page-12-0)]. The enzymes involved in the synthesis of azadirachtin have not been studied in detail. The pathway hierarchy in neemderived tetranortriterpenoid azadirachtin-A primarily requires the synthesis of a terpenoid backbone followed by steroid and triterpenoid biosynthesis. We found that the genes in the terpenoids and steroid biosynthesis family (TPS21, lytB, ispH, ispE, GGPS, +neomenthol dehydrogenase, FDPS, FDFT1 and SQLE) were more abundant in neem compared to A. thaliana, O. sativa, C. sinensis and V. vinifera. This study may help close the gap between traditional knowledge and current practices in the agrochemical industry. The progressive increase in the cost of petroleumbased starting materials has led to a surge in the price of synthetic pesticides scourging the meager profit margins presented to the farmers in developing countries. This study may provide a cost-effective alternative by aiding biotechnological research efforts in enhancing disease resistance in plants. ""]","[""conclusions The de novo sequencing and analyses of the draft genome and organ-specific transcriptomes of neem plant, Azadirachta indica is reported. A. indica is the first Meliaceae family member to be sequenced. The neem genome bears fewer repetitive elements compared to other sequenced higher plants. It has about 20,000 genes with an average transcript length of 1.69 kbp. A. indica's evolutionary closeness to Citrus species was verified by both molecular phylogenetic analyses and sequence similarity. Transcript expression and the exon-intron junction architecture of underlying genes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathways suggested relative abundance of enzymes involved in the azadirachtin synthesis in neem. Genes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathways in neem bear longer introns compared to the same genes in A. thaliana, O. sativa, V. vinifera and C. sinensis. ""]"
49,TA002480,10.3390/metabo14090472,The Legacy Effect of Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreaks on the Chemical andAnatomical Defences of Surviving Lodgepole Pine Trees.,"The recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks have caused widespread mortality amonglodgepole pine trees in western North America, resulting in a reduced populationof surviving trees. While previous studies have focused on the cascading impactsof these outbreaks on the physiology and growth of the surviving trees, thereremains a need for a comprehensive study into the interactions among variousphysiological traits and the growth in post-outbreak stands. Specifically, therelationship between chemical (primarily terpenes) and anatomical (mainly resinducts) defences, as well as the allocation of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs)to support these defence modalities, is poorly understood. To address these gaps,we conducted a field survey of surviving lodgepole pine trees in post-mountainpine beetle outbreak stands in western Canada. Our retrospective analysis aimedat determining correlations between the post-outbreak concentrations ofmonoterpenes, diterpenes, and NSCs in the phloem and the historical resin ductcharacteristics and growth traits before and after the outbreak. We detectedstrong correlations between the post-outbreak concentrations of monoterpenes andhistorical resin duct characteristics, suggesting a possible link between thesetwo defence modalities. Additionally, we found a positive relationship betweenthe NSCs and the total concentrations of monoterpenes and diterpenes, suggestingthat NSCs likely influence the production of these terpenes in lodgepole pine.Furthermore, historical tree growth patterns showed strong positive correlationswith many individual monoterpenes and diterpenes. Interestingly, while survivingtrees had enhanced anatomical defences after the outbreak, their growth patternsdid not vary before and after the outbreak conditions. The complexity of theserelationships emphasizes the dynamics of post-outbreak stand dynamics andresource allocations in lodgepole pine forests, highlighting the need for furtherresearch. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of coniferdefences and their coordinated responses to forest insect outbreaks, withimplications for forest management and conservation strategies.","Baker, Gigi, Zhao, Shiyang, Klutsch, Jennifer G, Ishangulyyeva, Guncha, Erbilgin, Nadir",2024,Metabolites,2,True,True,True,"[""**1. introduction** Periodic outbreaks of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) have caused extensive tree mortality, significantly altering forest structure and function [\\[1–](#page-21-0)[3\\]](#page-21-1) and shifting affected areas from carbon sinks to carbon sources [\\[4](#page-21-2)[–6\\]](#page-21-3).

While several studies have separately examined the impact of bark beetle outbreaks on anatomical and chemical defence mechanisms of the surviving trees, e.g., [\\[7](#page-21-5)[–9\\]](#page-21-6), few have explored the complex relationship between these defence modalities in the post-outbreak stands. This study aims to retrospectively examine the relationship between the constitutive terpenes in the current year's phloem of surviving pine trees and the historical resin duct characteristics of the same trees before and after the MPB outbreak in lodgepole pine stands affected by the outbreak. Interactions between conifers and bark beetles represent well-studied systems, integrating molecular, chemical, and ecological perspectives to elucidate the outcomes of these interactions [\\[15](#page-21-9)[–17\\]](#page-22-0). Bark beetles feed, mate, and lay eggs within the subcortical tissues (phloem/cambial zone) of mature trees, making them prominent agents of mortality in coniferous forests [\\[18\\]](#page-22-1). When confronted with bark beetle attacks, conifer trees employ a multifaceted defence strategy, involving both defence compounds and anatomical structures [\\[18](#page-22-1)[–24\\]](#page-22-2). Resin, a mixture of terpenes, serve as the primary defence against bark beetles for conifers. Monoterpenes and diterpenes, in particular, have received more attention due to their biological effects on bark beetles and their fungal associates [\\[25–](#page-22-3)[27\\]](#page-22-4). Pine phloem, the feeding site for bark beetles, contains large quantities of monoterpenes and diterpenes, which are expressed constitutively and are induced [\\[21,](#page-22-5)[28\\]](#page-22-6). The production of these terpenes is supported in part by non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), such as soluble sugars and starch [\\[29](#page-22-7)[–33\\]](#page-22-8). These NSCs are vital for various physiological and metabolic processes in trees [\\[31–](#page-22-9)[33\\]](#page-22-8). They also serve as substrates for secondary metabolite production [\\[33\\]](#page-22-8). Changes in carbohydrate production can impact both the storage and production of secondary metabolites, such as terpenes [\\[31,](#page-22-9)[32\\]](#page-22-10). While some studies report a positive association between terpenes and NSCs in tree phloem [\\[29\\]](#page-22-7), others do not [\\[34\\]](#page-22-11). Anatomical defences of conifers primarily involve the synthesis and storage of resin in specialized structures known as resin cells and resin ducts [\\[18,](#page-22-1)[20\\]](#page-22-12). These structures are interconnected axially and radially. Resin ducts are distributed throughout the primary and secondary xylem as well as the cortical tissues. Resin accumulated within these structures is transported to the point of bark beetle attacks. Consequently, the morphology of xylem resin ducts is often associated with the quantity of resin flow in response to wounds in the phloem [\\[35–](#page-22-13)[40\\]](#page-22-14). In some cases, resin ducts are linked to tree survival against bark beetles, with larger duct sizes and higher duct numbers showing stronger relationships with survival [\\[8,](#page-21-10)[41](#page-22-15)[–43\\]](#page-23-0). Our earlier investigations demonstrated distinct anatomical defence traits in surviving trees following MPB outbreaks compared to those killed by MPBs [\\[8\\]](#page-21-10). Consequently, the surviving trees contained higher concentrations of monoterpenes [\\[7\\]](#page-21-5). However, the interaction between these chemical and anatomical defences remains unknown within the lodgepole pine system. Therefore, our primary objective is to retrospectively investigate whether the constitutive concentrations of post-outbreak monoterpenes and diterpenes in the phloem of surviving pine trees correlate with the historical resin duct characteristics, radial growth, and tree growth traits (age and size) before and after MPB outbreaks in post-outbreak lodgepole pine stands. Additionally, we explored potential relationships between defence traits (chemical or anatomical) and NSCs in the phloem and any trade-offs between monoterpene and diterpene defences following the MPB outbreak. This study aims to shed light on the complex relationship between various defence modalities and tree characteristics amidst the MPB outbreak, providing valuable insights into the legacy impact of bark beetles on host trees. ""]","['**2. materials and methods** ', '*2.1. site selection* In July 2020, we identified five lodgepole pine-dominated forests in Jasper National Park, Alberta (Canada). Lodgepole pine constituted 45–59% of the total live and dead tree density (height > 1.3 m) in sites 1–3 and 100% in sites 4 and 5 (Table S1). Douglas-fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*), white spruce (*Picea glauca*), and aspen (*Populus tremuloides*) were the other tree species in these sites. All sites had experienced a recent MPB outbreak, as documented in historical records provided by Parks Canada. The outbreaks occurred in sites 1–3 in 2015 and in sites 4 and 5 in 2014. The sites were located at least 500 m apart. We gathered data on the on-site slope using a clinometer and aspect using a compass. Tree density at a site was calculated using an angle gauge with a basal area factor of 4.6 metric (20 standard). The tree species, health status (alive or killed by MPBs), and diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.3 m height) were measured for all trees within the plot (Table S1). Trees killed by MPBs were identified through characteristic pitch tubes, brood emergence holes on the tree stems, blue stains, and oviposition (maternal) galleries under the tree bark [\\[7\\]](#page-21-5). Conversely, the healthy lodgepole pines exhibited no visible symptoms of insect or pathogen attacks. ', '*2.2. sample collection* We selected 12 pairs of beetle-killed and healthy lodgepole pine trees in each site, with the DBH ranging from 18 to 22 cm (*n* = 60 trees per category). We obtained two phloem samples using a leather hollow punch that was 1.9 cm in diameter from each of the four cardinal directions at 1.3 m from ground on healthy trees (8 samples per tree). The punch was cleaned using 70% ethanol before each sampling. The samples were wrapped in labelled aluminium foil and immediately placed into liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored on dry ice during transportation from the field to the laboratory and put in a −40 ◦C freezer until chemical analysis. Furthermore, we obtained one increment core with a diameter of 5 mm and one with a diameter of 12 mm at 1 m above the ground from the north and south aspects of each health tree. The core that was 5 mm in diameter was drilled to the pith of the tree and used to determine its age. The cores with a 12 mm diameter contained at least 20 years of annual rings, dating back from the sampling year, which were used to determine the anatomical defence and growth characteristics of trees in the last 15 years. The cores were stored in plastic drinking straws. To determine the year of the outbreak in each site, we took a wedge from the south-facing aspect of each beetle-killed tree at the DBH. The wedges contained at least 20 years of growth, counting back from the year of death. ', '*2.3. chemical analysis* After removing the outer bark from the phloem samples, we ground the samples in liquid N with a mini bead beater at 2200 rpm for three 20 s intervals. The eight samples from each tree were pooled together before analysis. The samples from each tree were divided into three groups for the following chemical analyses: monoterpenes (100 mg), diterpenes (30 mg), and NSCs (30 mg). All these analyses followed the protocols reported by Cale et al. [\\[44\\]](#page-23-1). ', '2.3.1. monoterpene analysis At room temperature, 0.5 mL of hexane with pentadecane (0.004%) (internal standard) was mixed with 100 mg of the sample. The mixture was vortexed for 30 s, sonicated for 10 min, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 18,213 g at 4 ◦C. This process was repeated twice for each sample. The extract was transferred to a 2 mL GC (gas chromatograph) vial and stored at −40 ◦C until analysis. Extracts were analysed with a GC-MS (GC 7890A, Mass Spectrometry (MS) 5975C, Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with an Agilent HP-Chiral 20B column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 µm film). The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−<sup>1</sup> . The temperature began at 50 ◦C and increased to 72 ◦C at a rate of 75 ◦C min−<sup>1</sup> , where it was held for 0.5 min, then increased at 30 ◦C min−<sup>1</sup> to 90 ◦C and held for 2 min. It was then increased to 95 ◦C at 3 ◦C min−<sup>1</sup> and held for 1 min, then increased to 100 ◦C at 5 ◦C min−<sup>1</sup> and held for 0.5 min, then to 150 ◦C at 8 ◦C min−<sup>1</sup> , and finally, to 175 ◦C at 15 ◦C min−<sup>1</sup> and held for 1.5 min. The total run time for each sample was 23.6 min. We identified the hexane-extractable compounds, mostly monoterpenes, one phenylpropanoid (4-allyanisole), and one terpene derivative and its acetate ester (borneol and bornyl acetate) (hereafter, monoterpenes), by comparing the mass spectra and retention times to those of known standards. Monoterpenes were quantified using standard curves from four dilutions prepared from analytical standards of (+)-limonene (chemical purity, 99%); (−)-limonene (99%); α-terpinene (95%); (+)-α-pinene (98.5%); (−)-α-pinene (98%); myrcene (94%); 3-carene (98.5%); (+)-β-pinene (98%); (−)-β-pinene (99%); β-phellandrene (90%); (+)-camphene (90%); γ-terpinene (97%); terpinolene (90%); 4-allylanisole (98.5%); R-(+)-pulegone (97%); bornyl acetate (97%); (−)-borneol (99%); linalool (98%); ocimene (90%); and α-terpineol (90%). Concentrations were reported as ""µg mg−<sup>1</sup> of dry weight (DW)"" phloem tissue. ', '2.3.2. diterpene analysis Diterpenes were extracted from 30 mg of lyophilized ground tissue in 1 mL of methanol. The mixture was vortexed for 30 s then centrifuged for 10 min at 18,213 rcf at 4 ◦C. The supernatant was transferred to 2 mL GC vials and kept at −40 ◦C until analysis. Diterpene acid extractions were analysed using an Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (UHPLC, 1290 Infinity, Agilent Tech.) fitted with an InfinityLab Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm 1.9 µm, Agilent Tech.) and a Diode Array Detector (UV/Vis, 1290 DAD, Agilent Tech.). Gradient analyses were performed with a binary solvent system: 1.7% *v*/*v* acetic acid with ultra-pure water (A) and 100% methanol (HPLC grade) (B) with a flow rate of 0.3 mL min−<sup>1</sup> . A 5 µL volume was used. The system started at 75% B for 1 min, then increased to 85% B over 9 min, held for 2 min, decreased to 75% B over 2 min, and held at 3 min. The total run time was 17 min. Diterpene resin acids were quantified using wavelengths of 240, 268, and 282 nm, as adapted from a multiwavelength detection approach from Kersten et al. [\\[45\\]](#page-23-2). Standard curves calculated from dilutions prepared of pimaric acid (80%), abietic acid (95%), dehydroabietic acid (99%), isopimaric acid (99%), levopimaric acid (95%), neoabietic acid (99%), palustric acid (92%), and sandarocopimaric acid (90%) were used to quantify diterpene acids. Pimaric and isopimaric acids were listed together due to coelution with abietic acid and cannot be quantified individually. Concentrations were reported as ""µg mg−<sup>1</sup> of DW"" phloem tissue. ', '2.3.3. non-structural carbohydrate (soluble sugars and starch) analyses All three soluble sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose) were extracted from 30 mg of the lyophilized and ground phloem tissue. The sample was mixed with 1.3 mL of ultra-pure water in a 2 mL tube. A marble was placed in the opening of the tube. Tubes were placed above a boiling pot of water and enclosed in steam for 1 h. A 0.5 mL aliquot was collected and centrifuged. Then, 0.4 mL of a supernatant was placed in a new 2 mL tube with 1.0 mL of HPLC-grade methanol. The extracts were then incubated at room temperature for one h. Then, 0.5 mL of the extract was transferred to 2 mL GC vials and kept at −40 ◦C until analysis. Glucose, fructose, and sucrose were analysed with the UHPLC system that was fitted with an Infinity Lab Poroshell 120 HILIC-Z column (2.1 × 100 mm 2.7 µm, Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA, USA) as well as with an Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD, 1290 ELSD II, Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA, USA). A gradient analysis was performed using a binary solvent system of 0.034% *v*/*v* ammonium hydroxide to buffer ultra-pure water (A) as well as acetonitrile (HPLC grade), also buffered with 0.034% *v*/*v* ammonium hydroxide (B). The flow rate was set to 0.2 mL min−<sup>1</sup> . A 4 µL injection volume was used. The solvent system started at 90% B for 2 min then decreased to 75% B over 3.5 min, where it was held for 1 min. It was then increased to 90% B over 2 min and held there for 0.5 min. The total run time was 9 min. The ELSD settings were set so that the nebulizer temperature was 25 ◦C, the evaporator tube temperature was 60 ◦C, and the gas flow rate was 1.40 SLM. Dilutions prepared from analytical standards of glucose (99%), fructose (99%), and sucrose (99.55%) were used to calculate standard curves to quantify soluble sugars. For starch extraction, 25 mg of the lyophilized ground phloem tissue was used. Enzymatic digestions were used to convert starch into gluconate-6-phosphate, as described in Cale et al. [\\[44\\]](#page-23-1). As with the soluble sugar extraction, samples were held in steam for 1 hr. Samples were then vortexed for 30 s. A 0.4 mL aliquot was transferred to a new 2 mL tube with 0.4 mL of an alpha-amylase solution of 75 g of an enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 100 mL of ultra-pure water. This enzyme converts starch to large soluble sugars (e.g., maltose). The tubes were vortexed immediately for 30 sec and then incubated in a 50 ◦C bath for 16 h. Following the incubation, tubes were removed from the water bath and then inverted twice. The extracts were then centrifuged at 18,213 rcf for 15 min, which removed undigested glucose-containing polymers (e.g., hemicellulose). After this, 0.4 mL of the supernatant was transferred to a new 2 mL tube containing 0.4 mg of an amyloglucosidase solution consisting of 3 g of an enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a 60 mL sodium acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.5). This enzyme converts maltose and other large sugars to glucose. The tubes were incubated in a 50 ◦C bath for 16 h. Tubes were removed from the water bath and inverted twice. The extracts were centrifuged at 18,213 rcf for 15 min. Then, 0.4 mL of the extracts were transferred to 2 mL GC vials and stored at −40 ◦C until analysis. We pipetted 0.020 mL of the starch extract into a 96-well plate. Next, 0.2 mL of glucose hexokinase (Sigma Aldrich)—isomerase (phosphoglucose isomerase, Sigma Aldrich)—was added to each well. This converted starch aliquots into gluconate-6-phosphate, as described by Cale et al. [\\[44\\]](#page-23-1). The well plate was shaken at room temperature for 45 min on an orbital shaker. Then, the amount of gluconate-6-phosphate was measured at an absorbance of 340 nm using the Synergy Microplate Reader H1 (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The starch concentration was quantified using two calibration curves: the first to estimate the glucose concentration from the amount of gluconate-6-phosphate measured and the second to estimate the starch concentration using the estimated glucose concentration. To do this, the sample concentration of the total glucose was standardized by sample dry weights and extraction volumes after the first calibration curve. Previously determined concentrations of soluble glucose and fructose (hexoses) were subtracted from the estimated total glucose concentration. A conversion factor was applied to account for potential quantification differences. The second calibration curve used dilutions of pure potato starch standards processed with the same enzymatic digestions as described above. The potential matrix effects were calculated to adjust the final concentrations accordingly. ', ""*2.4. anatomical defence and growth characteristics* Core and wedge samples were glued to wooden mounts and dried for two weeks at room temperature. Samples were then sanded with belt and hand sanders using progressively finer sandpapers. Samples were then scanned at 1200 dpi to create high-resolution digital images. The annual growth (mm) was measured from the pith to last year's annual ring using ImageJ for all core samples [\\[8\\]](#page-21-10). Calendar years were assigned to each annual ring by visual cross-dating ring characteristics, such as the width ratio and the colour contrast between earlywood and latewood per ring. This information was used for wedges to determine the year of death of trees killed by MPBs. The earliest death recorded was considered the starting year of the outbreak in a particular site. Among the five sites, two sites experienced an outbreak in 2014, and the remaining three sites had an MPB outbreak in 2015. Therefore, the healthy trees were separated into two outbreak years: 2014 (*n* = 24) and 2015 (*n* = 36). All samples for resin ducts were examined using ImageJ within a fixed sampling width of 10 mm [\\[8\\]](#page-21-10). To analyse the resin ducts, the resin duct production (number of resin ducts per 10 mm width per year on a ring [no. year−<sup>1</sup> ]), resin duct size (mean size of resin ducts per 10 mm width per year on a ring [mm<sup>2</sup> year−<sup>1</sup> ]), total resin duct area (sum of resin duct area per 10 mm width per year on a ring [mm<sup>2</sup> year−<sup>1</sup> ]), resin duct density (total number of resin ducts per year divided by the ring area (10 mm \\* ring width) for a given year [no. mm<sup>2</sup> year−<sup>1</sup> ], and relative resin duct area (percent area occupied by resin ducts per year within a ring area for a given year [% year−<sup>1</sup> ]) were calculated for each core that had a diameter of 12 mm [\\[12,](#page-21-11)[43\\]](#page-23-0). The ring width (mm year−<sup>1</sup> ) and basal area increment (BAI) (mm<sup>2</sup> year−<sup>1</sup> ) were used to represent tree radial growths. Tree radii and ring width data were used to calculate the BAI, assuming that tree rings are concentric circles. Tree radii were calculated by dividing the tree DBH by two. "", '*2.5. data analysis* To study the long-term relationship between the growth and defence mechanisms in healthy pine trees, we analysed the annual growth and resin duct characteristics across three distinct periods: two pre-outbreak periods (5 years and 10 years before the outbreak) and one post-outbreak (from outbreak onset until 2019, when the last annual ring was formed at the time of sampling) period. We conducted Pearson correlation tests to examine correlations between terpenes (21 monoterpenes, six diterpene resin acids, total monoterpenes, and total diterpenes); NSCs (three soluble sugars, starch, and total NSCs); and five anatomical defence traits and two radial growth characteristics. The analysis was performed using R (Version 4.0.5) [\\[46\\]](#page-23-3), using the *Hmisc* R package [\\[47\\]](#page-23-4). We selected the BAI to represent tree radial growths, as it strongly correlates with the ring width (Pearson correlation coefficient was > 0.96 in both the 2014 and 2015 outbreak years). In the analyses, we considered the overall as well as the total and individual concentrations of the constitutive monoterpenes and diterpenes. ', '2.5.1. gradient analysis We employed an indirect gradient analysis to examine the impact of resin duct characteristics, BAIs, tree ages, and DBHs on the overall monoterpenes, diterpenes, and NSCs before and after outbreaks. We utilized non-linear multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity to ordinate monoterpenes, diterpenes, and NSCs using the vegan R package [\\[48\\]](#page-23-5). The NMDS results were saved as RData files to ensure reproducibility. Subsequently, we projected resin duct characteristics from pre- and post-outbreak periods onto NMDS axes as environmental gradients and visualized these relationships using ordination triplots created with the ggplot2 R package [\\[49\\]](#page-23-6). We followed the same steps when incorporating the radial growth characteristics from pre- and post-outbreak periods and the tree growth traits (age and DBH) into the NMDS axes for the 2014 and 2015 outbreak years. ', '2.5.2. linear mixed-effect models To identify relationships among defence and growth characteristics, we employed linear mixed-effect models, treating the site as a random effect and using the R package lme4 [\\[50\\]](#page-23-7). We visually assessed model assumptions, including the normality and homogeneity of residuals, applying transformations and rescaling as needed. The resin duct density and the percent resin duct area were standardized per 1 mm<sup>2</sup> and accounted for the BAI prior to calculation. Furthermore, we investigated the relationships between the total monoterpenes or diterpenes and tree growth traits using linear mixed-effect models. When we observed a statistically significant relationship, we conducted further linear mixed-effect models with the site as a random effect to examine the specific relationship between individual monoterpenes or diterpenes and a particular predictor. In all cases, significance was determined at α = 0.05. ', '2.5.3. comparative analyses We compared anatomical defences and radial growth responses across pre- and postoutbreak periods within the 2014 and 2015 outbreak years using linear mixed-effect models. The variability across sites was accounted for by nesting trees within sites. Furthermore, we examined the differences in tree age and DBH between the 2014 and 2015 outbreak years using linear mixed-effect models, where the site was considered a random effect to address any unexplained variances among the trees. ']nan","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['**4. discussions** We conducted a retrospective analysis of the constitutive monoterpenes and diterpenes, NSCs, and their interactions with anatomical defences and growth characteristics in surviving lodgepole pine trees in post-MPB-outbreak stands. We observed a strong correlation between post-outbreak concentrations of monoterpenes in the phloem and the historical resin duct characteristics in the xylem, along with a positive association between NSCs and the total monoterpenes and diterpenes. Despite finding no evidence of growth release (BAI) in surviving pine trees, we observed strong positive relationships between the BAI and several individual monoterpenes and diterpenes. Notably, tree age had a negative relationship with the monoterpenes. Furthermore, the outbreak enhanced the resin duct characteristics in lodgepole pine. Our analyses, however, revealed no relationships between the anatomical defence traits, BAI, tree age, size, and NSCs, nor did we find evidence supporting a trade-off between the monoterpenes and diterpenes. These findings offer valuable insights into our broader understanding of conifer defences, particularly concerning how anatomical defences interact in response to outbreaking bark beetle species. Our study showed strong correlations between monoterpenes and resin duct characteristics. Notably, the overall monoterpenes highly correlated with at least one of the five resin duct characteristics. For instance, the total monoterpenes were linked to the resin duct production, the resin duct size, and the total resin duct area. Furthermore, those monoterpenes that are crucial during MPB host colonization, such as (−)-α-pinene, β-phellandrene, (+)-limonene, and myrcene, had positive relationships with all resin duct characteristics, agreeing with our prior research findings [\\[7](#page-21-5)[,21](#page-22-5)[,51\\]](#page-23-8). Likewise, Kichas et al. [\\[14\\]](#page-21-8) reported strong correlations between the resin duct area, resin duct production, and monoterpene concentrations in whitebark pine (*P. albicaulis*). In contrast, we found fewer relationships between the diterpenes and resin duct characteristics, suggesting a weaker association between them. Similarly, Mason et al. [\\[22\\]](#page-22-16) reported that the anatomical defence traits of lodgepole pine differentially influenced the different classes of terpenes. Collectively, these findings highlight that the relationship between chemical and anatomical defences may depend on the classes of defence compounds [\\[14\\]](#page-21-8). This is in line with the conclusion from a meta-analysis, suggesting that trade-offs between monoterpenes and resin ducts are relatively rare across a wide range of plant species despite occasional occurrences in some systems [\\[52\\]](#page-23-9). Nonetheless, these results highlight the complementary role of anatomical and chemical defence structures in post-outbreak lodgepole pine stands, likely in response to the MPB outbreaks [\\[7,](#page-21-5)[8,](#page-21-10)[20,](#page-22-12)[22,](#page-22-16)[39](#page-22-17)[,41](#page-22-15)[,42](#page-22-18)[,53\\]](#page-23-10). The second contribution of our study lies in the evidence regarding the positive relationship between total NSCs and total monoterpenes or total diterpenes within the 2015 outbreak. Although such relationships were not consistent among the sites, this result suggests that the production of monoterpenes or diterpenes is linked to NSCs, aligning with previous research findings [\\[29,](#page-22-7)[30,](#page-22-19)[33,](#page-22-8)[54\\]](#page-23-11). For instance, Mullin et al. [\\[55\\]](#page-23-12) reported a positive relationship between the starch concentration and total monoterpenes and diterpenes in lodgepole pine trees across varying elevations. Generally, it is well-documented that terpenoid defences require substantial energy demands [\\[32](#page-22-10)[,56–](#page-23-13)[58\\]](#page-23-14) and deplete carbohydrate reserves [\\[29,](#page-22-7)[30,](#page-22-19)[32\\]](#page-22-10). However, the absence of a similar relationship between anatomical defences and NSCs suggests that our current understanding of the connections between sinks (defences) and sources (NSCs) in conifers is limited and necessitates further field testing [\\[30](#page-22-19)[,37\\]](#page-22-20). One of the strongest relationships we observed is that both the monoterpenes and diterpenes were positively correlated to the tree radial growth, as measured by the BAI. In fact, the BAI exhibited positive relationships with up to 65% of the individual monoterpenes, including (+)-limonene, (−)-α-pinene, myrcene, and β-phellandrene. Similarly, we observed a positive relationship between the individual diterpenes, including dehydroabietic, levopimaric, palustric, neoabietic, and abietic acids, and the BAI in the 2015 outbreak year. It is worth noting that the varying diterpene–BAI relationships between the outbreaks in 2014 and 2015 could be attributed to differences in pine density, as the pine density in the former was nearly double that of the latter. We observed negative correlations between tree age and the monoterpenes in the 2014 and 2015 outbreak years. Specifically, the age of trees was linked to approximately 45% of the individual monoterpenes in the 2014 outbreak and 40% in the 2015 outbreak. Notably, (+)-limonene, (−)-α-pinene, γ-terpinene, and linalool exhibited the strongest negative associations with tree age. These findings suggest that irrespective of the tree size, tree age may be an important factor in determining the allocation of carbon resources to defence mechanisms. It appears that as trees mature, the allocation of resources to defences becomes less of a priority, whereas younger trees may invest more heavily in defence mechanisms. This could be attributed to the fact that younger trees are potentially more vulnerable to herbivory and thus prioritize defence allocation more than older trees, as supported by Swihart and Bryant [\\[59\\]](#page-23-15). In the case of lodgepole pine, it was found that young trees in the range of 30–50 years old exhibited a greater resistance to ophiostomoid fungi carried by MPBs compared to both younger and older trees [\\[60\\]](#page-23-16). Overall, the relationship between the ontogeny of investment in defence versus growth in long-lived trees remains a complex and unresolved topic within this field of research [\\[2,](#page-21-4)[61\\]](#page-23-17). The MPB outbreak influenced various physiological and growth traits of surviving lodgepole pine trees. Firstly, the post-outbreak conditions improved the resin duct characteristics compared to the pre-outbreak conditions, with the resin duct size, relative resin duct area, and total resin duct area all increasing. This suggests that an increased investment in anatomical defences following MPB outbreaks, agreeing with the results of earlier studies. For instance, Zhao and Erbilgin [\\[8\\]](#page-21-10) reported an increased resin duct investment in surviving lodgepole pine trees. Resins serve as the initial line of defence for trees against bark beetle attacks by providing physical and chemical protection [\\[18](#page-22-1)[,25](#page-22-3)[,62](#page-23-18)[,63\\]](#page-23-19). The number and size of xylem resin ducts in pine trees can predict resin production in response to wounding or bark beetle attacks [\\[36,](#page-22-21)[37,](#page-22-20)[39\\]](#page-22-17). Pines that survive MPB attacks tend to have more and larger xylem resin ducts [\\[8,](#page-21-10)[41,](#page-22-15)[42,](#page-22-18)[53\\]](#page-23-10) and an increased pre-attack resin production [\\[64\\]](#page-23-20). Based on the anatomical defence and terpene duct characteristics observed in this and other studies, it would be expected that beetles would show a preference for larger pine trees. Finally, our study did not provide evidence of growth release (BAI) in the surviving lodgepole pine trees. Furthermore, we found no connections between anatomical defence traits and BAI or evidence suggesting any notable relationships between monoterpenes and diterpenes. These findings contradict those of Kichas et al. [\\[14\\]](#page-21-8), who reported significant correlations between BAI and resin duct characteristics in whitebark pine and lodgepole pine. We suspect that the enhanced anatomical defences observed after outbreaks may have required additional resources to support their development and maintenance rather than growth. Alternatively, other conifer species, such as spruce, and understory woody plant species, like aspen, may have taken advantage of the available resources following the MPB outbreaks in this study, affecting the growth of surviving lodgepole pine trees. This suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing post-outbreak stand dynamics and resource allocation in these forest ecosystems, highlighting the need for further research to understand these intricate relationships fully. In conclusion, our retrospective analysis of lodgepole pine trees surviving bark beetle outbreaks revealed a complex interplay between chemical and anatomical defences. Strong correlations between the post-outbreak monoterpene concentrations and resin duct characteristics underscore the importance of these chemical defences in tree resilience, aligning with previous studies on conifer defences [\\[7,](#page-21-5)[14,](#page-21-8)[21\\]](#page-22-5). Although we observed positive relationships between the basal area increment (BAI) and certain monoterpenes and diterpenes, the absence of a significant growth release and the negative correlation between tree age and monoterpenes suggest balanced resource allocation strategies in response to beetle outbreaks. Despite the increased investment in resin ducts and a positive link between NSCs and terpene concentrations, no direct connections were found between anatomical defences and BAIs. These findings indicate that while anatomical and chemical defences are crucial, their interactions and impacts on growth remain complex and warrant further investigations to fully understand the dynamics within post-outbreak forest ecosystems [\\[8](#page-21-10)[,22](#page-22-16)[,29,](#page-22-7)[55,](#page-23-12)[59,](#page-23-15)[60\\]](#page-23-16). **Supplementary Materials:** The following supporting information can be downloaded at: [https:](https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/metabo14090472/s1) [//www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/metabo14090472/s1,](https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/metabo14090472/s1) Table S1.

50,TA039446,10.1371/journal.pone.0316178,Research on using Aquilaria sinensis callus to evaluate the agarwood-inducingpotential of fungi.,"Agarwood is a precious resinous heartwood highly valued for its cultural,religious, and medicinal significance. With the increasing market demand, naturalagarwood resources are rapidly depleting, making the development of effectiveartificial induction methods for agarwood highly significant. This study aims toexplore the feasibility of using callus tissue to assess the ability of fungi toinduce agarwood formation. We selected two fungi isolated from Aquilariasinensis, W-1 (Podospora setosa) and W-15 (Alternaria alstroemeriae), and usedthe known agarwood-inducing fungi YMY (Pestalotiopsis sp.) as a positive control,by treating A. sinensis callus with their fermented filtrates. The experimentalresults showed that W-1 and W-15 treatments significantly enhanced the activityof Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Peroxidase (POD) in the callus tissue andupregulated the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS),1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and sesquiterpene synthase(ASS-1). GC-MS analysis further confirmed that the contents of sesquiterpenes andaromatic compounds in A. sinensis treated with W-1 and W-15 were significantlyelevated, suggesting that these fungi possess the capacity to induce theformation of agarwood. This study demonstrates that using callus tissue to screenfungi capable of inducing agarwood is feasible and effective, providing newinsights for screening fungi resources that efficiently induce agarwood formationin the future.","Wang, Zhikai, Zhou, Guoying, Chen, Jungang, Miao, Xinyu, Xia, Yandong, Du, Zhuang, Liu, Junang",2024,PloS one,2,False,False,True,"Agarwood is a highly valuable dark resinous heartwood formed in Aquilaria species following lightning strikes, animal gnawing, or pest attacks. Due to its cultural, religious, and medicinal significance, the demand for agarwood has continually increased, leading to over-exploitation and illegal trade of Aquilaria trees, which resulted in its listing under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1995. To prevent the extinction of Aquilaria sinensis and to meet market demand, methods such as physical injury, chemical induction, and microbial inoculation have been used to artificially induce agarwood formation in A. sinensis. Compared to physical and chemical induction methods, microbial agents treeare considered to be capable of intermittently and continuously inducing agarwood formation. Many scientists have been dedicated to isolating various fungi from different parts of Aquilaria trees, and have confirmed that Trichoderma, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium, Lasiodiploidia are capable of inducing agarwood formation.Fungi, as the key factor in inducing agarwood formation, stimulate A. sinensis to produce defensive secondary metabolites through intricate physiological and biochemical mechanisms. In a natural environment, when agarwood trees are infected by fungi, the tree recognizes the fungi invasion and activates its defense response, a process considered the starting point of agarwood formation. The core of the defense response lies in inducing stress responses through signaling pathways, leading to enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, triggering the expression of a series of disease-resistant genes, and ultimately resulting in the accumulation of secondary metabolites. These metabolites, including sesquiterpenes and 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones, are the main active components of agarwood.Fungi infection is often accompanied by oxidative stress responses in plant cells. Plant cells counter pathogen invasion by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anions (O₂⁻). To mitigate the toxicity of ROS, the antioxidant enzyme system within agarwood trees is rapidly activated. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Peroxidase (POD), and Catalase (CAT) are the main antioxidant enzymes involved, working together to eliminate excess ROS and maintain redox balance within cells. The enhancement of these enzyme activities is not only a direct response of plants to fungi invasion but also indirectly promotes the activation of secondary metabolic pathways related to agarwood formation. Under fungi induction, the secondary metabolic pathways within agarwood trees are significantly activated, particularly the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) are the key rate-limiting enzymes in the MVA and MEP pathways, respectively. The upregulated expression of these enzymes promotes the increased synthesis of sesquiterpene compounds. Sesquiterpene synthase (ASS-1) is a typical wound-induced gene responsible for sesquiterpene formation in agarwood. Studies have found that ASS-1 expression is barely detectable in healthy A. sinensis callus or cell cultures, but its expression significantly increases in wounded tissues or jasmonic acid methyl ester-treated callus, leading to a corresponding increase in sesquiterpene compounds. Fungi infection can significantly increase the accumulation of secondary metabolites in Aquilaria trees by regulating the gene expression of defense enzymes and these key enzymes, thereby enhancing the yield and quality of agarwood.The callus of A. sinensis is an undifferentiated cell mass induced from plant tissue through in vitro culture, and it shares physiological and biochemical similarities with the whole tree. The metabolic pathways and stress responses of callus tissue largely retain the characteristics of the tree, making it a common model for studying the formation mechanisms of agarwood. However, because callus tissue grows in a controlled environment, lacking the complex structure and environmental interactions found in mature trees, its research findings may require further validation and optimization when applied to actual trees. Therefore, we consider whether callus tissue can be used to screen fungi that promote agarwood formation.In this study, we selected the fungi W-1 and W-15, whose ability to promote agarwood formation was not previously established, and used the known agarwood-inducing fungi YMY as a positive control. We treated the callus tissue and preliminarily explored the feasibility of using callus tissue to assess the ability of fungi to induce agarwood formation, providing a new approach for screening fungi that induce agarwood.","Based on the induction formula described by Liu et al modifications were made to the Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal salt medium by supplementing it with 1 mg/L NAA and 2 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine to induce callus formation in A. sinensis. To maintain the growth of the callus, subcultures were performed every 4 weeks using fresh callus induction medium (S1 Fig).Fungi were isolated from A. sinensis in Chengmai County, Hainan. The fungi isolates were purified by culturing on PDA plates at 28°C for 5 days and using hyphal tip isolation technique. Genomic DNA was extracted from the fungi isolates using the Fungi Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ITS region was amplified by PCR using universal primers ITS1 (5’-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3’) and ITS4 (5’-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3’). The PCR products were sent to Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. for sequencing. The obtained sequences were searched against the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolated fungi was performed using Mega 11.0 software with 1000 bootstrap replicates.The fungi used in this experiment included W-1 (Podospora setosa), W-15 (Alternaria alstroemeriae), and YMY (Pestalotiopsis sp.). These fungi were isolated and preserved by the Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration on Control of Artiffcial Forest Diseases and Pests in South China (Changsha, China). The three fungi strains were inoculated into 150 ml sterilized Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) solution in Erlenmeyer flasks and cultured at a constant temperature of 28°C for 5 days to obtain the fermentation filtrate. Healthy callus tissues of A. sinensis were treated with 100 μl of W-1, W-15, YMY fermentation filtrate, and sterile PDA, with each treatment replicated three times. The YMY (CK2) filtrate served as the positive control, while the sterile PDA (CK) was the negative control.The callus tissues of A. sinensis were treated with the fermentation filtrates of W-1, W-15, YMY, and sterile PDA, and samples were collected at different time points (0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h) post-treatment to measure the levels of SOD. Approximately 0.2 g of the callus tissue was added to 1 mL of extraction solution and homogenized in an ice bath. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected and kept on ice for testing SOD activity was measured according to the kit instructions (Suzhou Grace Biotechnology Co., Ltd). Each experiment was conducted three times. Each group was replicated three times.The callus tissues of A. sinensis were treated with the fermentation filtrates of W-1, W-15, YMY, and sterile PDA, and samples were collected at different time points (0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h) post-treatment. to measure the levels of POD. Approximately 0.2 g of the callus tissue was added to 1 mL of extraction solution and homogenized in an ice bath. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected and kept on ice for testing. POD activity was measured according to the kit instructions (Suzhou Grace Biotechnology Co., Ltd). Each experiment was conducted three times. Each group was replicated three times.The callus tissues of A. sinensis were treated with the fermentation filtrates of W-1, W-15, YMY, and sterile PDA, and samples were collected at different time points (0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 h) post-treatment. Total RNA was extracted using the RNAprep Pure Plant Plus Kit (Beijing Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd). Using the Evo M-MLV Kit (Changsha Accurate Biotechnology Co., Ltd), 4 μl of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions for qRT-PCR analysis. PCR amplification was performed on the QuantStudio 3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, China) using SYBR Green Pro Tag HS (Changsha Accurate Biotechnology Co., Ltd). The PCR cycling conditions were the same as described by Yu et al.. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) gene was used as an internal control. The experiment included three independent biological replicates, and the relative expression levels of HMGS, DXR, and ASS-1 were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method. The primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table 1.Seven-year-old A. sinensis (from the Chengmai State Forest Farm, Chengmai County, Hainan Province, located at 19°67′E, 110°01′N) were treated with 200 ml of fermentation filtrates from W-1, W-15, and YMY, with each treatment replicated three times, and the YMY fermentation filtrate served as the control(CK). Three months later, agarwood samples were obtained, and 3 grams of A. sinensis wood chips were weighed and extracted using an ultrasonic bath in an ice-water mixture. The analysis was conducted using a 7890A-5975C gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, USA) under the following conditions: initial temperature of 50°C held for 2 minutes, ramped to 170°C at 5°C/min, then increased to 310°C at 10°C/min and held for 10 minutes. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, with an injection volume of 1 μL. The detected compounds were identified using the NIST11 mass spectrometry database and retention times.Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 software. Duncan’s new multiple range test was used for significance analysis.","The ITS gene sequences amplified from strains W-1 and W-15 were obtained through sequencing and submitted to GenBank. The accession numbers for these sequences are PP508237 and PP508252, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that W-1 clustered with Podospora setosa, with a branch support rate of 99.00% (Fig 1). W-15 clustered with Alternaria alstroemeriae, with a branch support rate of 99.00% (Fig 2).In this study, the SOD activity in callus treated with W-1 and W-15 showed an initial increase followed by a decrease, with the SOD activity in W-1 treatment peaking at 457.36 U/gmin-1 at 48 h, and W-15 treatment peaking at 474.49 U/gmin-1 at 8 h. This pattern of change is consistent with previous studies; in contrast, the SOD activity in YMY-treated callus initially decreased, but significantly increased after 24 h, reaching a peak of 388.89 U/gmin-1 (Fig 3). This differing pattern of change may be related to the different active components or strains in the YMY fermentation filtrate. It is worth noting that the SOD activity in the sterilized PDA treatment showed no significant change, further confirming that W-1, W-15, and YMY all can induce changes in SOD activity in A. sinensis callus.In this study, the POD activity in callus treated with W-1 peaked at 220.50 U/gmin-1 at 12 h. In contrast, the POD activity in W-15 treated callus reached a maximum of 211.16 U/gmin-1 at 48 h. Differently, the POD activity in YMY-treated callus peaked at 4 hours, then decreased, but rose again to the highest value of 230.83 U/gmin-1 at 48 h (Fig 4). The results indicate that both fungi could significantly alter POD activity in A. sinensis callus.The qRT-PCR results indicated that after treatment with W-1 and W-15 fermentation filtrates, the relative expression levels of the HMGS, DXR, and ASS-1 genes were higher than those in the sterilized PDA treatment group and were similar to those observed in the YMY fermentation filtrate treatment group (Fig 5).Under W-1 fermentation filtrate treatment, the expression level of the HMGS gene initially increased and then decreased over the course of the experiment, peaking at 4 h, reaching 3-fold that of the control group. Under W-15 fermentation filtrate treatment, the expression trend of the HMGS gene was similar to that under W-1 treatment, also peaking at 4 h, at 2.5-fold the level of the control group. Under YMY fermentation filtrate treatment, HMGS gene expression peaked at 48 h, reaching 3-fold that of the control group (Fig 5A) The expression levels of the DXR gene peaked at 0 h under W-1, W-15, and YMY fermentation filtrate treatments, reaching 5-fold, 7.5-fold, and 6.5-fold that of the control group, respectively, before gradually decreasing (Fig 5B).Under W-1 fermentation filtrate treatment, ASS-1 gene expression peaked at 8 h, reaching 120-fold that of the control group, and this trend continued. Under W-15 fermentation filtrate treatment, ASS-1 gene expression showed a trend of rising, then falling, and rising again, peaking at 8 h at 130-fold that of the control group. Under YMY fermentation filtrate treatment, ASS-1 gene expression peaked at 12 h, reaching 70-fold that of the control group (Fig 5C).These results indicate that the metabolic pathways in A. sinensis callus were activated after treatment with W-1 and W-15, significantly enhancing the activity of related metabolic enzymes.To further verify whether A. sinensis callus can be used to screen for agarwood-inducing fungi, the samples were treated with W-1, W-15, and YMY fermentation filtrates for six months, resulting in a color change (Fig 6). GC-MS analysis revealed that 231, 305, and 242 compounds were detected in the samples treated with W-1, W-15, and YMY, respectively (S1–S3 Tables). The content of sesquiterpenes in the essential oils treated with W-1 and W-15 was 9.76% and 16.69%, respectively, while the content in the control group was 10.12% (Table 2). Four terpenoid compounds were common to all samples: Dehydrofukinone, Alloaromadendrene, Cycloheptane, 1-ethenyl-1-methyl-4-methylene-2-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)-, and Squalene. Among them, Dehydrofukinone and Alloaromadendrene exhibit antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, while Squalene is a triterpene with various applications in the food, chemical, and healthcare industries. Aromatic compounds also contribute to the distinctive fragrance of agarwood. The content of aromatic compounds in the essential oils treated with W-1 and W-15 was 21.61% and 21.6%, respectively, compared to 16.66% in the control group. Benzylacetone, which has antitussive, expectorant, and antiasthmatic effects, was detected in both the treatment and control groups. The content of chromone compounds was relatively low in the essential oils treated with W-1 and W-15, at 3.07% and 3.17%, respectively, compared to 4.38% in the control group. The experimental results indicate that W-1 and W-15 have the ability to induce agarwood formation.","Due to the slow and unpredictable process of agarwood formation in nature, recent research has increasingly focused on the artificial production of agarwood through fungi induction. Fungi serve as natural inductors, facilitate the accumulation of agarwood in a process that is both economically feasible and environmentally sustainable. However, only 8% of the fungi isolated from Aquilaria trees have been investigated for their capacity to enhance the production of agarwood. Therefore, identifying fungi species capable of efficiently inducing agarwood formation is of great significance.When plants are under stress, it leads to an explosion of ROS that disrupt the plant’s internal balance. Plants signal through hormones and ions to activate the downstream defense systems, such as antioxidant enzymes and secondary metabolite synthesis. Finally, a large quantity of stored carbohydrates are synthesized into secondary metabolites, thereby assisting the plant in resisting stress. Zhu et al. used the endophytic fungi GG22 (Fusarium oxysporum) to treat Rehmannia, which increased the SOD and POD activities in Rehmannia, activated or enhanced the expression of related enzymes in primary metabolic pathways, and thereby increased the content of secondary metabolites. Changes in defense enzyme activity are often accompanied by the accumulation of specific secondary metabolites. In the process of agarwood formation, fungi infection induces the activity of antioxidant and defense enzymes, promoting the synthesis of terpenoids and phenylpropanoids, which are key aromatic compounds in agarwood. Similarly, in other plants, fungi infection can promote the accumulation of metabolites such as flavonoids, coumarins, and alkaloids by regulating the activity of defense enzymes. In this study, the activities of SOD and POD were enhanced after treatment with W-1 and W-15. The results showed that W-1 and W-15 can induce the necessary defense responses by activating the activity of related enzymes.In the process of agarwood formation, mechanical damage or other stressors activate specific genes and metabolic pathways, which ultimately result in the production of secondary metabolites like sesquiterpenes and 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone. The metabolic pathway of terpenoids has been extensively researched, but the biosynthesis of chromone derivatives has received relatively less attention. Sesquiterpenes are synthesized by multiple enzymes via the MVA pathway in the cytoplasm and the MEP pathway in the plastids. Liu et al. found that the fungi Phaeoacremonium rubrigenum increases sesquiterpene biosynthesis by upregulating enzymes in the MVA pathway of A. sinensis. Zhang et al. showed that methyl jasmonate and hydrogen peroxide can increase the expression of the SaDXR gene in Santalum album., thereby enhancing the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes. In this study, treatment with W-1 and W-15 significantly increased the expression levels of the HMGS and DXR genes in the callus tissues of A. sinensis. This upregulation might be part of the callus’s defense response to fungi infection, thereby promoting agarwood formation. The expression pattern of the ASS-1 gene was consistent with previous findings, showing minimal expression in callus tissues treated with sterile PDA but significant expression following W-1 and W-15 treatments. The experimental results showed that the activities of POD, SOD, and the expression levels of the ASS-1, HMGS, and DXR genes in the experimental groups and the positive control group were all higher than those in the negative control group, indicating that W-1 and W-15 have similar capabilities to YMY in inducing agarwood production.The effectiveness of these fungi in inducing agarwood formation was further confirmed by GC-MS analysis. The results showed a significant increase in the variety of volatile oil compounds in A. sinensis treated with W-1 and W-15, particularly in the content of sesquiterpenes and aromatic compounds. The sesquiterpene content in the W-1 treated samples was 9.76%, in W-15 treated samples 16.69%, compared to 10.12% in the control group. These results suggest that W-1 and W-15 can effectively induce agarwood formation. Moreover, the content of aromatic compounds in the W-1 and W-15 treated samples was significantly higher than in the control group, further confirming the effectiveness of these fungi in promoting agarwood formation. The results confirmed that fungi W-1 and W-15, similar to YMY, possess the ability to induce agarwood production. In conclusion, using callus tissue to assess the ability of fungi to induce agarwood formation is a rapid and reliable method. This approach not only enables the rapid determination of the ability of fungi to promote agarwood formation in the laboratory, but also contributes to the protection of wild A. sinensis.","This study explored the feasibility of using callus tissue to evaluate the potential of fungi to induce agarwood formation. The experimental results showed that W-1 and W-15 treatments significantly enhanced the activity of SOD and POD in the callus tissues, while also upregulating the expression of key metabolic enzymes such as HMGS, DXR, and ASS-1. These changes suggest that W-1 and W-15 have similar potential to YMY in inducing agarwood formation. Moreover, GC-MS analysis revealed a significant increase in the content of sesquiterpenes and aromatic compounds in the samples treated with W-1 and W-15, further validating the effectiveness of these two fungi in inducing agarwood formation. Therefore, this study demonstrates that using callus tissue as a method for rapidly screening fungi that promote agarwood formation is feasible and effective. This method not only offers new insights for screening fungi resources that efficiently induce agarwood formation but also contributes to the protection and sustainable use of wild A. sinensis resources."
51,TA041172,10.3831/KPI.2023.26.2.167,In vitro Antibacterial Activity and Wound Healing Effects of Achillea millefoliumEssential Oil in Rat.,"OBJECTIVES: In this study we aimed to evaluate the in vitro antibacterialactivity and wound healing properties of Achillea millefolium essential oil(AMEO) in full-thickness wound model in rat. The antibacterial activity of AMEOwas evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using thebroth dilution method. METHODS: The 2 cm × 2 cm full-thickness excisional woundswere created on the back of animals. Topical therapy was applied twice a dayusing 1%, 2%, and 3% w/w AMEO ointments, and the measurement of the wounds areawas carried out every 3 days, after that the wound closure percentage wascalculated in these days. Hydroxyproline content and histopathological evaluationof wound tissue samples were carried out on day 7 and 14 post wounding. Eucerinwas used for the treatment of vehicle control group and negative control groupreceived no treatment. RESULTS: Our results revealed the bacteriostatic activityof AMEO against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Wound healing activity evaluation ofAMEO showed the significant increase (p < 0.05) in the wound closure percentagesin rats treated with AMEO 1% and 2% comparing to those of non-treatment group. Inaddition, hydroxyproline contents of tissue significantly (p < 0.01) increased inAMEO 1% and 2% comparing to non-treatment group. Histopathological evaluations ofwound tissue samples on day 7 and 14 demonstrated higher accumulation of collagenfibers, reduction of edema and inflammation and also formation of tissueappendages in 1% and 2% AMEO treated groups in comparison with non-treatmentgroup. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicated that AMEO has thepotential to be used as a safe and effective wound healing agent.","Ghasemi, Mohammad Reza, Ranjbar, Akram, Tamri, Pari, Pourmoslemi, Shabnam, Nourian, Alireza, Dastan, Dara",2023,Journal of pharmacopuncture,2,False,False,True,"Wound healing is a complex process consisting of four complex steps: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. The hemostasis phase of wound healing, comprising vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and coagulation, occurs rapidly. The second phase is initiated right after injury and consists of cell signaling, migration of different cells such as macrophages to the wound site, the cell cascade signaling process, led by cytokines, and finally fibroblast activation and proliferation, which leads to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the collagen structure. The final phase is the restoration of normal characteristics of the wound site.Various factors may interrupt or delay the processes mentioned above, and these include opportunistic bacterial infections. The clinical signs of an infected wound are topical pain and erythema, infectious exudate, and malodor. Infection in a wound caused by bacteria is the main reason for chronic wounds, which can lead to mobility disorders, multiple-organ dysfunction, and even more life-threatening situations. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the two most common pathogens isolated from chronic wounds.There are a variety of therapeutic agents and techniques for treating wounds. However, chronic and non-healing wounds are one of the most common health problems worldwide and can often lead to disability or even mortality. Therefore, researching new techniques and drugs to accelerate wound healing is critical. In recent years, medicinal plants and their derivatives, such as essential oils, have been considered by researchers to be sources for the production of new agents effective in wound healing.Achillea millefolium, also known as yarrow, is a species of the Asteraceae family and has a long history of traditional uses in treating gastrointestinal disorders, hepatic diseases, rheumatic pain, pneumonia, and wound healing in several cultures across Asia and Europe. The anti-inflammatory effects of A. millefolium essential oil (AMEO), caused by the inhibition of proteases, have been widely demonstrated in several studies. GC-Mass analysis of AMEO identified several active components such as Eucalyptol, camphor, α-terpineol, β-pinene, and borneol.In vitro studies of the AMEO have demonstrated antioxidant and antimicrobial properties against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Candida krusei.The main purpose of this study was to evaluate wound-healing potential and the antibacterial activity of AMEO against two common microorganisms (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) involved in wound infection.","Standard strains of S. aureus (S. aureus, ATCC6538) and P. aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa, ATCC 27853) were purchased from the Persian Type Culture Collection at the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST), Tehran, Iran. The bacteria were cultured on nutrient agar (NA). A 0.5 McFarland standard (the final concentration of 108 CFU/mL of each organism individually) was prepared by harvesting the organisms and suspending them in a saline solution.Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of AMEO against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were determined using the broth dilution method. Serial dilutions of AMEO in broth (0.0625, 0.125, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mL/mL) were prepared in test tubes, next, 100 µL of bacteria suspension (107 CFU/mL of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa strains) with 1 mL SCDB (Soya Bean Casein Digest Broth) were inoculated to each test tube, before being incubated at 37℃ for 24 h. The control tubes (media control and organism + media control) were also prepared for each strain. The lowest concentration of the AMEO that produces no turbidity (no visible growth) was considered the MIC.Achillea millefolium essential oil was purchased from Shafa Kurdistan Inc. (Iran, Kurdistan) and 1, 2, and 3 g of essential oil were mixed in 100 g of Eucerin in order to prepare 1%, 2%, and 3% W/W ointments of AMEO, respectively.30 Wistar rats (weighing 200 ± 30 g) of both sexes were used in this study. The animals were kept in individual cages under standard conditions of temperature (22 ± 2℃) relative humidity (50-55%), and 12:12 h light-dark cycles. Animals were allowed to adapt to laboratory conditions for seven days before the experiment.The rats were divided randomly into six groups (n = 5). The negative control group received no treatment, the vehicle group received topical Eucerin, and the test groups received 1%, 2%, and 3% AMEO ointment, respectively. Phenytoin 1% cream was used as a positive control. After anesthetizing the rats with an IP injection of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg), the hairs of the wound site were shaved and the area was disinfected with 70% ethanol, then a full-thickness excisional wound with dimensions of 2 cm × 2 cm was created on the back of each animal. Wound treatments were typically applied twice a day, beginning two hours after wound creation until complete wound closure.The wound areas were measured every three days by analyzing photographs of the wounds using ImageJ software, while wound closure percentage was calculated using the following equation:Full-thickness cross-section specimens were collected on days 7 and 14 post-wounding. For the histopathological study, samples were fixed in 10% formalin, while for the hydroxyproline assay skin samples were homogenized and centrifuged, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at –80℃ until needed.Hydroxyproline is one of the structural components of collagen. Determining the amounts of hydroxyproline in tissue indicates the amount of synthesized collagen in the tissue. The hydroxyproline assay kit was purchased from KiaZist life sciences, Iran. The assay of the hydroxyproline content of tissue samples was conducted according to the manufacturer’s guidelines seven and 14 days after wound creation.Histopathological studies of the samples were carried out using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome staining. Inflammation, re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, and extracellular matrix deposition were evaluated by H&E staining, while the degree of collagen deposition was observed using Masson’s trichrome staining.Data are presented as mean ± SD, and data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism via one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests. The significance level was p < 0.05 for all analyses.","Determining the MIC by the broth dilution method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of AMEO. The results showed that AMEO can inhibit the growth of both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The MICs of AMEO for both microorganisms were at a concentration of 1 m/mL.The average time to complete wound closure for the AMEO 1%, AMEO 2%, AMEO 3%, Phenytoin, Eucerin, and negative control groups were 19.4, 22, 26, 27, 26, and 26 days, respectively. The complete wound closure time of the AMEO 1% treated group was significantly shorter than those of the other groups (p < 0.01) except for the AMEO 2% group. The complete wound closure time of AMEO 2% was significantly shorter than those of the AMEO 3%, Phenytoin, Eucerin, and negative control groups (p < 0.01). Interestingly, the positive control group, which was the wounds treated with Phenytoin, had the slowest closure rate.Three days after wound creation, the AMEO 1% and 2% treated groups demonstrated a significantly higher wound closure rate (34.4% ± 7.1 and 32.75 ± 4.43, respectively) in comparison with the negative control group (19.92% ± 137.2) (p < 0.05). On day 6 post-wounding, the wound closure rate was significantly higher in rats treated with AMEO 1% ointment (48.3% ± 4.02) compared with the negative control (33.65% ± 8.42) and vehicle groups (35.2% ± 7.44) (p < 0.01). On day 9 and 12 post-wounding, wound closure rates in rats treated with AMEO 1% (69.8% ± 4.7 and 78.45% ± 5.9, respectively) and AMEO 2% (62.95% ± 3.39 and 75.1 ± 2.17, respectively) were significantly higher when compared to those of the negative control group (50.31% ± 5.39 and 61.45% ± 4.45, respectively) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in wound closure rate between Eucerin (vehicle) treated animals and the negative control group on days 3, 6, 9, or 12 (Fig. 1).The results of the hydroxyproline assay are shown in Fig. 2. The hydroxyproline contents of tissue samples obtained from animals treated with AMEO 1% (170.4 ± 5.98 and 196 ± 7.6 µg/mg tissue on days 7 and 14, respectively) and AMEO 2% (171.6 ± 6.94 and 193.6 ± 4.636 µg/mg tissue on days 7 and 14, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those of negative control group (153.2 ± 8.87 and 164.8 ± 4.76 µg/mg tissue on days 7 and 14, respectively) (Fig. 2).The histopathological study of the wound tissue in the different experimental groups showed attenuated inflammation response and more collagen deposition in the AMEO 1% treated group compared with the other experimental groups on day 7 post-wounding (Fig. 3, 4).The formation of the epidermal layer with more cell layers, the formation of epidermal protrusions and dermal papillae, the reappearance of skin appendages, and a reduction of edema and inflammation in granulation tissue were observed in samples obtained from AMEO 1%-treated animals on day 14 post-wounding. The histopathological study of samples obtained from the AMEO 3%, Eucerin-treated, and negative control groups showed no new epidermal layer or coagulum, as well as a reduction in edema and inflammation in granulation tissue. In addition, reduction of vascular hyperemia and accumulation of collagen fibers in granulation tissue was observed in these groups on 14 post-injury. A study of samples obtained from animals treated with AMEO 2% on day 14 revealed the formation of a thin epidermal layer and a reduction in edema, inflammation, and vascular hyperemia as well as a significant accumulation of collagen fibers in granulation tissue (Fig. 5, 6).","Skin wounds are the most common health issues people encountered throughout their lives, so developing new methods and drugs for encouraging optimal wound healing is essential. Medicinal plants and their derivatives can be used as an important source for developing potential new drugs effective for wound healing.In this study, we evaluated the wound-healing potential of Achillea millefolium essential oil in a full-thickness wound rat model. Considering that one of the main reasons for delayed wound healing is an infection caused by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, the in vitro antibacterial activity of A. millefolium essential oil against these two microorganisms was also investigated. The results of this study showed that AMEO at a concentration of 2% or less (with AMEO 1% ointment being the most effective concentration) has the potential to accelerate wound healing by attenuating the inflammatory response and increasing collagen synthesis and antibacterial activity. Achillea has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds throughout the world; and the name Achillea is derived from Achilles, the Greek hero who used yarrow to heal soldiers’ wounds during the Trojan War. The wound-healing activity of A. millefolium extracts has been evaluated in several studies, although, to date, no studies have investigated the effects of A. millefolium essential oil on wound healing.Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the most representative molecules of Achillea essential oil and each one of the evaluated monoterpenes demonstrated wound-healing properties. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are often associated with wound-healing activity.Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and the most important component of the extracellular matrix. Considering that hydroxyproline amino acid exists exclusively in collagen protein, we measured the amount of hydroxyproline in the tissue samples obtained from the studied groups to estimate the collagen content in healing wound tissue from the different experimental groups. The hydroxyproline assay showed that AMEO 1% and 2% significantly increased the hydroxyproline content in tissue. These results seem to indicate that increasing collagen synthesis is one of the possible mechanisms by which AMEO can heal wounds. The increased collagen synthesis may be because of the presence of large amounts of terpenes in AMEO. It is likely that AMEO stimulates the migration of fibroblasts to the wound site and activates them to produce collagen. Increased collagen production in the AMEO 1% and 2%-treated groups was also confirmed by histological studies.Another important finding of this study was the antibacterial activity demonstrated by AMEO against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, the most common bacteria isolated from chronic wounds, which often form a biofilm resistant to many antibiotics. Co-infection with these two bacterial strains is a major challenge in the treatment of chronic wounds. Antibacterial wound dressings decrease the risk of bacterial infection during wound healing and prevent the wounds from becoming chronic. Based on the results of this study, AMEO has the potential to be used as an antibacterial wound dressing in combination with synthetic biomaterials.","This study has shown that AMEO has the potential to treat wounds. AMEO accelerated the wound-healing process by attenuating the inflammatory response and stimulating both collagen synthesis and angiogenesis. In addition, AMEO’s antibacterial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa can reduce the risk of wound infection, meaning that it has the potential to be used in combination with standard antibiotics in the treatment of infected wounds. Also, it could be used in combination with synthetic biomaterial for the preparation of antibacterial wound dressings."
52,TA049573,10.3390/molecules23102602,Kappa Opioid Receptor Agonist Mesyl Sal B Attenuates Behavioral Sensitization toCocaine with Fewer Aversive Side-Effects than Salvinorin A in Rodents.,"The acute activation of kappa opioid receptors (KOPr) produces antinociceptiveand anti-cocaine effects, however, their side-effects have limited furtherclinical development. Mesyl Sal B is a potent and selective KOPr analogue ofSalvinorin A (Sal A), a psychoactive natural product isolated from the plantSalvia divinorum. We assessed the antinociceptive, anti-cocaine, and side-effectsof Mesyl Sal B. The anti-cocaine effects are evaluated in cocaine-inducedhyperactivity and behavioral sensitization to cocaine in male Sprague Dawleyrats. Mesyl Sal B was assessed for anhedonia (conditioned taste aversion),aversion (conditioned place aversion), pro-depressive effects (forced swim test),anxiety (elevated plus maze) and learning and memory deficits (novel objectrecognition). In male B6.SJL mice, the antinociceptive effects were evaluated inwarm-water (50 °C) tail withdrawal and intraplantar formaldehyde (2%) assays andthe sedative effects measured with the rotarod performance task. Mesyl Sal B (0.3mg/kg) attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization tococaine without modulating sucrose self-administration and without producingaversion, sedation, anxiety, or learning and memory impairment in rats. However,increased immobility was observed in the forced swim test indicatingpro-depressive effects. Mesyl Sal B was not as potent as Sal A at reducing painin the antinociceptive assays. In conclusion, Mesyl Sal B possesses anti-cocaineeffects, is longer acting in vivo and has fewer side-effects when compared to SalA, however, the antinociceptive effects are limited.","Kivell, Bronwyn M, Paton, Kelly F, Kumar, Nitin, Morani, Aashish S, Culverhouse, Aimee, Shepherd, Amy, Welsh, Susan A, Biggerstaff, Andrew, Crowley, Rachel S, Prisinzano, Thomas E",2018,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"Drug addiction is a relapsing, compulsive disorder characterized by a lack of control in drug intake even when adverse consequences are apparent. Psychostimulants, such as cocaine, are widely abused and currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments for psychostimulant addiction. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that kappa opioid receptor (KOPr) activation attenuates cocaine-induced behaviors such as cocaine self-administration, cocaine-enhanced locomotion, behavioral sensitization to cocaine, and the reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking. These effects of KOPr agonists can be attributed to their ability to decrease dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. KOPrs have been shown to form oligomers with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and this interaction was also increased in the presence of Salvinorin A (Sal A) and results in an increase in the dopamine uptake by DAT. KOPr activation in the ventral tegmental area also decreases dopamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex. These decreased dopamine levels within the reward pathways are likely responsible for reducing the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse. However, the side-effects of traditional KOPr agonists, such as depression, dysphoria, sedation, and aversion have limited the therapeutic development of these agents. Several strategies have been employed to reduce the side-effects profile of KOPr agonists, including the development of G-protein biased agonists and peripherally restricted KOPr agonists.Sal A, derived from the hallucinogenic sage plant Salvia divinorum (Lamiaceae), is a potent and selective KOPr agonist. Sal A has a novel neo-clerodane diterpene structure and shares similar pharmacological properties with the traditional KOPr agonists. Previously, we have reported that Sal A and the analogues, 2-ethoxymethyl ether Sal B and β-tetrahydropyran Sal B, attenuate cocaine-prime induced cocaine seeking without inducing sedation or suppressing operant sucrose reinforcement in rats in a similar fashion to the traditional KOPr agonists U50488, U69593, and spiradoline. However, Sal A has a rapid onset and short duration of the effects attributed to the quick metabolism at the C-2 position to the metabolite Salvinorin B. Sal A is also a substrate for the P-glycoprotein efflux pump. Because of this poor pharmacokinetic profile, Sal A cannot be developed as an anti-cocaine agent. Structure-activity relationship studies involving Sal A suggests the C-2 position is important in the binding and activation of KOPr by Sal A and is likely to be important in the design of analogues with improved pharmacokinetics. Recently, C-2 substituted Sal A analogues have been synthesized with varying affinity for KOPr compared to Sal A. Other pharmacological studies indicate that C-2 substituted Sal A analogues are longer acting. Therefore, developing Sal A analogues with anti-cocaine properties, improved pharmacokinetics, and fewer side-effects are desirable for the development of potential anti-cocaine pharmacotherapies.The Sal A analogue (2S,4aR,6aR,7R,9S,10aS,10bR)-9-(methanesulfonyloxy)-2-(3-furanyl)dodecahydro-6a, 10b-dimethyl-4,10-dioxy-2H-naptho [2,1-c]pyran-7-carboxylic acid methyl ester (Mesyl Sal B) has a mesylate substitution at the C-2 position and has been shown to have similar binding affinity for KOPr to Sal A and U69593. We have previously shown that Mesyl Sal B improved the pharmacokinetic effects in mice, using the warm-water tail withdrawal assay, and attenuated cocaine-prime induced cocaine seeking/taking in cocaine self-administering rats. It has also been demonstrated that Mesyl Sal B attenuates the alcohol intake in mice following chronic escalation drinking.Single and intermittent cocaine exposure produces an increase in the locomotion activity and an increased locomotion sensitized response following a cocaine challenge in animals with prior cocaine experience. The mesolimbic dopaminergic system has been implicated in cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization and increased extracellular dopamine levels are observed within the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens of rats receiving cocaine. Since cocaine behavioral sensitization might play a part in craving and relapse to drug use, understanding the factors involved in attenuating behavioral sensitization to cocaine is likely to be useful for designing anti-cocaine therapeutics. Therefore, we tested the effect of Mesyl Sal B on cocaine-induced hyperactivity and the expression of cocaine behavioral sensitization in rats.Furthermore, Mesyl Sal B was assessed for the side-effects associated with the traditional KOPr agonists, U50488 and U69593, as well as the parent compound Sal A. In laboratory animals, Sal A produces sedation and aversion, therefore, we tested the effect of Mesyl Sal B on rotarod performance in mice, and conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and conditioned place aversion (CPA) in rats. Since Sal A produces depressive effects, we also tested the effect of Mesyl Sal B on swimming behaviors using the forced swim test (FST), anxiogenic effects using the elevated plus maze (EPM), and cognitive performance using the novel object recognition task.","Cocaine HCl (BDG Synthesis, Wellington, New Zealand) was dissolved in 0.9% saline. Sal A was isolated from dried Salvia divinorum leaves and Mesyl Sal B synthesized from Sal A (>98% pure by HPLC). Nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) and (trans-(±)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N(2-[1-pyrrolidinyl]-cyclohexyl) benzenacetamide methanesulfonate (U50488) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Auckland, New Zealand). The doses of the KOPr agonists and antagonists were based on previous studies. Drugs were suspended in either 75% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for the cocaine hyperactivity, behavioral sensitization, sucrose self-administration, CTA and FST procedures; a 2:1:7 ratio of DMSO: Tween-80: water for the novel object recognition, CPA and EPM procedures; a 2:1:7 ratio of DMSO: Tween-80: saline (0.9%) for the warm-water tail withdrawal; or a 1:4:5 ratio of DMSO: propylene glycol: phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for the intraplantar formaldehyde assay and rotarod procedures. All solutions were administered via intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) injection, with the final volume made up to 1 mL/kg in rats and 10 mL/kg in mice. All drug weights refer to the salt.The PathHunter™ U2OS cell line was purchased from the DiscoveRx Corporation (Fremont, CA, USA) and stably expresses β-arrestin2 and hKOR (U2OS-hKOR-βarrestin2-DX). These cells were cultured in a Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 500 µg/mL G418 and 250 µg/mL hygromycin B and grown at 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity and 37 °C. The PathHunter™ assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were plated overnight using an AssayComplete™ Cell Plating 5 Reagent (DiscoveRx, Fremont, CA, USA) in 384 well clear bottom plates (Grenier Bio One, North Carolina, NC, USA; Item No. 788093) at a density of 20,000 cells/well. Cells were treated with KOPr agonist doses for 30 min at 37 °C and then a fresh plating reagent and PathHunter™ detection reagent (DiscoveRx Corporation, Fremont, CA, USA) was added and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Chemiluminescence was detected using an EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader-2300 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).Assays evaluating attenuation of cAMP levels utilized the HitHunter™ CHO cell line (DiscoveRx Corporation, Fremont, CA, USA) and were performed as described previously. Data were analyzed using a nonlinear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). cAMP accumulation data were normalized to the vehicle and forskolin-only control values. β-arrestin-2 recruitment data were normalized to the vehicle and U50488 maximum response values. All compounds were run in parallel assays in triplicate or quadruplicate in ≥2 individual experiments. As previously published, calculations of bias were determined using the following equation, where U50488 was the control compound. Using this formula, a bias factor of 1 is a balanced agonist, less than 1 is a G-protein biased agonist and more than 1 is a β-arrestin2 biased agonist.Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) and adult male B6.SJL protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type c allele a (ptprca) mice (23–30 g) were housed within the Victoria University of Wellington animal facilities. All animals were group housed in polycarbonate cages in temperature (19–21 °C) and humidity (55% relative humidity) controlled rooms. Lights were maintained on a 12:12 h cycle with lights on at 07:00 h. Unless stated otherwise, all animals were given free access to food and water except during experimental sessions. All animals were handled for at least 3 days prior to experimentation to acclimatize the animals to handling and prevent stress during experimental procedures. The laboratory care of animals and experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Victoria University of Wellington Animal Ethics Committee and were carried out in agreement with the New Zealand Animal Welfare Act, 1999.The dose of Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) was chosen based on the lowest effective dose that has previously been shown to attenuate drug seeking/taking behavior in the rat. For cocaine-induced activity tests, drug naïve rats were initially injected with either vehicle (75% DMSO, 1 mL/kg, i.p.) or Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) followed 45 min later with either 0.9% saline (1 mL/kg, i.p.) or cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and locomotion activity determined in an open field chamber (Med Associates ENV-520; St. Albans, VT, USA) in 5 min intervals for 60 min. The expression of locomotor sensitization experiments was performed as previously described for Sal A. Briefly, drug naïve rats were treated with either 0.9% saline (1 mL/kg, i.p.) or cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 5 consecutive days and were immediately returned to their home cage. On days 6–9, the animals were drug-free and remained in their home cage. On day 10, the effect of Mesyl Sal B pre-treatment was tested on the expression of cocaine sensitization. Rats were injected with either a vehicle (75% DMSO, 1 mL/kg, i.p.) or Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) followed, 45 min later, by cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and the locomotion activity was measured for 60 min. The dose of cocaine was selected based on previous reports, which showed that cocaine administration (20 mg/kg, i.p.), once daily for 5 consecutive days, produced locomotor sensitization in rats.The cumulative dose-response effects of the KOPr agonists were measured using the warm-water tail withdrawal assay as previously described. Mice were habituated to the Plexiglas restrainers (internal diameter 24 mm) for 15 min daily for the 4 days prior to the experiment. Withdrawal latencies were measured by immersing one-third of the tail in a warm water bath (50 ± 0.5 °C) and the time to withdraw recorded. To avoid tissue damage, a maximum cut-off latency of 10 s was used. Three measurements were averaged for the baseline latency of each individual mouse. The maximum possible effect (% MPE) was calculated using the following formula:The test latencies were measured at 30 min following each subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of KOPr agonist (delivered at 5 μL/g of weight), and the next escalating dose administered, therefore evaluating the dose-response effects using a within animal design. For Sal A and Mesyl Sal B, the following cumulative doses were assessed: 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 mg/kg. A non-linear regression analysis was used to determine the potency (EC50) and efficacy (Emax) of the data compared to the known full KOPr agonist U50488.The procedure was carried out as previously described. The apparatus consisted of a box (27.5 × 18.5 cm) placed on a glass surface with a 45° angled mirror placed underneath to facilitate observations of the hind paws via a digital video camera. The mice were habituated to the test enclosure for 15 min before testing. The mice were given the KOPr agonist or vehicle treatment via i.p. injection 5 min prior to the administration of 20 μL of formaldehyde (2% in PBS) or PBS control via intraplantar injection. The pain behaviors were recorded for 60 min. The methods of Dubuisson and Dennis were used to assess the pain behavior of the injected paw using a weight-bearing score. The pain was scored as 0 if the mouse showed normal behavior; 1 for partial weight-bearing with only the digits touching the floor; 2 with no weight-bearing with the paw raised; and 3 where the paw was bitten, licked or shaken. Pain behavior scores were assigned at 5 s intervals for 60 min by an observer blinded to the treatment group. An average pain score was calculated for each 5 min time period. For the area under the curve analysis, the two phases of pain were separated out as follows: 0–15 min phase 1 nociceptive pain; and 20–60 min phase 2 inflammatory pain.Mice were initially trained to run on the rotarod (60 mm wide and 30 mm in diameter; Panlab, Harvard apparatus, Barcelona, Spain) at 16 rpm for 120 s. Mice that were able to successfully complete two consecutive trials from a maximum of three trials without falling were chosen for the experimental procedure. Mice were injected with either vehicle, Sal A or Mesyl Sal B and immediately placed on the rotarod at 16 rpm for 120 s. The time at which the mouse fell from the rotarod apparatus was recorded and the test repeated at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 min using a within animal design.For sucrose reinforcement tests, rats were maintained at approximately 85% of their initial feeding weights with free access to water throughout the experiment. Rats were trained to orally self-administer a 10% sucrose solution in eight modular test chambers (Med Associates) as previously described. Rats were trained to self-administer sucrose orally using an auto-shaping procedure (45 min daily for ten days). Once stable responding was achieved, the animals were maintained on a Fixed Ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement where depression of the active lever (left lever) led to the delivery of sucrose solution. Following oral acquisition, the response requirements were increased to an FR5 schedule of reinforcement. Daily 1 h sessions were conducted until there was less than 20% variation in responding for three consecutive days. The animals on stable FR5 reinforcements were subjected to the sucrose reinforcement test. On the test day, rats received either vehicle (75% DMSO, 1 mL/kg, i.p.) or Mesyl Sal B (0.3, 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and 45 min later, sucrose reinforced lever-press responding was recorded for 60 min.The effect of KOPr agonists on learning and memory were evaluated in the novel object recognition tasks based on the methods of Schindler et al.. Briefly, male Sprague Dawley rats were handled on days 1–2 days prior to 3 days of habituation in the empty test box for 30 min daily (days 3–5). On day 6 rats were familiarized to the constant object by securing two identical objects on either side of the test box (3 times for 6 min each with an interval time of 10 min). Long-term memory was tested 24 h following familiarization (day 7) following the i.p. injection of either treatment or vehicle and time spent exploring the novel and familiar object recorded using Smart software (Panlab, Harvard Apparatus). The recognition index (RI) was calculated as N/(F + N)) × 100, where N is the time (in seconds) spent with the novel object and F is time spent with the familiar object. Rats that only interacted with a single object were excluded. A within animal subject design using a balanced Latin square design was performed with a one-week rest period between each drug administration (n = 24 with 2 exclusions (n = 22 per treatment)). Due to the long-acting effects of nor-BNI in vivo, a group of 6 rats were administered nor-BNI (+U50488) at the end of the experiment to evaluate whether the effects on novel object recognition were KOPr mediated.Rats had free access to food but were water deprived for 23 h (water habituation session) or 23 h 20 min (saccharin sessions) per day for the entire duration of the study. During habituation sessions, rats received water, whereas, on the pairing and test days, animals received a 0.1% novel tasting saccharin solution. On day 1, rats were placed on a water deprivation schedule for 23 h. The following day, animals were given access to water for 1 h. The amount of water consumed was measured daily and the process repeated until the variation in water consumption was ≤2 mL for three consecutive days. The next day, instead of water, the rats were presented to a novel tasting saccharin solution (0.1%). The amount of saccharin consumed was noted for 40 min. The animals were divided into two saccharin consumption matched groups and immediately treated with either vehicle (75% DMSO, 1 mL/kg, i.p.) or Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.). The next day, the rats were given water for 60 min. On the following test day, the rats were presented with saccharin solution and consumption measured. In order to determine any taste aversion, the saccharin consumption in the Mesyl Sal B treated group on test day was compared with the vehicle-treated group.CPA was measured using a three-chambered place preference chamber (LE890, PanLab; Harvard Apparatus) using previously described methods. One large chamber was black and white striped with a black rough floor, while the other was white with black spots with a white smooth floor. Experiments were recorded via a video camera in the presence of white noise and the time spent in each chamber was tracked using the SMART software (version 3.0; PanLab; Barcelona, Spain). The rats were handled daily for several days prior to experimentation. On the first experimental day, the animals were placed in the corridor of the three-chamber box and allowed to freely move between chambers for 15 min, and the time spent in each chamber was recorded. Rats showing a greater than 80% preference for any chamber were excluded from the study. On day 2, the rats were injected with the vehicle or Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) with a volume of 1 mL/kg and immediately confined to their preferred chamber for 45 min. The following day (day 3), the animals were injected with the vehicle and confined to their non-preferred chamber for 45 min. Days 2 and 3 were repeated twice, a total of 3 times each. The time between the conditioning sessions ranged from 10 to 15 h. On day 8, the rats were placed in the corridor and allowed free access to both chambers for 15 min. The time in each box was measured and then the percent time in the drug-paired chamber was calculated.The FST apparatus consisted of a cylinder (44 cm high and 20 cm in diameter) filled to 35 cm with water maintained at 25 ± 1 °C. On the habituation day, the rats were placed in the swim chamber for 15 min and the following day were administered either with Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) or the vehicle (75% DMSO, 1 mL/kg, i.p.) and placed in the swim chamber45 min later. The forced swimming behavior was recorded by a video camera and the climbing, swimming, or immobility behaviors were recorded for 5 min. Data were analyzed using the SMART software (version 3.0; PanLab, Barcelona, Spain).The EPM was custom made according to the dimensions of Walf and Frye with the addition of open arms having 2.5 cm high clear plastic sides and elevated to 55 cm. The rats were placed in the center of the apparatus facing an open arm and recorded by a video camera for 5 min. The time spent in the open arm was measured by an experimenter blinded to the treatment group.The GraphPad Prism software was used to determine statistical significance. Comparisons between treatments were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data for sucrose intake, novel object recognition, CTA, FST, and total ambulatory counts for cocaine-induced hyperactivity and expression of sensitization experiments were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnet’s or Bonferroni multiple comparisons post hoc tests. Comparisons of multiple effects were analyzed using two-way ANOVA. The time-course analysis was performed using repeated measures two-way ANOVA (treatment × time interaction) followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test (every 5 min interval) for cocaine-induced hyperactivity, expression of behavioral sensitization, and the intraplantar 2% formaldehyde tests and at times indicated for the rotarod performance test. Student t-tests were applied for CPA to compare pre- and post-test times, and in EPM to determine differences in time spent in open arm between control-treated rats. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and were considered to reach statistical significance when p < 0.05.","Mesyl Sal B is a novel Sal A analogue previously shown to bind KOPr with similar binding affinity (Mesyl Sal B, Ki = 2.3 ± 0.1 nM vs. Sal A, Ki = 1.9 ± 0.2 nM) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the human KOPr, using [125I]IOXY as the radioligand; and similar potency (EC50 = 30 ± 5 nM) to Sal A (EC50 = 40 ± 10 nM) assessed using [35S]GTPγS functional assays in CHO cells (Figure 1). Data from functional cellular assays measuring KOPr-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation (DiscoveRx HitHunter assays) and in assays evaluating β-arrestin2 recruitment are shown in Table 1. Assays evaluating signaling bias compare the potency and efficacy of test ligands (Mesyl Sal B) against reference ligands (U50488) in both G-protein dependent and independent assays. Here we use the cAMP and β-arrestin2 recruitment assays to evaluate signaling bias and show that Mesyl Sal B is a full agonist in both assays, and furthermore, to show that Mesyl Sal B has G-protein signaling bias.Studies to determine the effects of Mesyl Sal B on cocaine-induced hyperactivity in rats are shown in Figure 2. Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) suppressed the cocaine-induced hyperactivity when administered 45 min prior to cocaine (Figure 2b). A time course of effects on suppression of cocaine-induced hyperactivity was performed between 5–60 min, with 45 min pre-incubation showing optimal effects (data not shown). The time-course analysis revealed a significant effect of Mesyl Sal B on cocaine-induced hyperactivity (F (3,168) = 23.64, p < 0.0001) at 5, 10, and 20 min (Bonferroni post hoc test; Figure 2a).The effect of Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) on the expression of cocaine sensitization in rats is shown in Figure 2c,d. Control cocaine-sensitized rats produced a significant increase in the locomotor activity on the test day (day 10) compared to the saline-treated rats indicating the expression of cocaine sensitization (F(3,23) = 6.15, p = 0.003). Cocaine–sensitized rats were given a single injection of Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) on the test day had attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures of time indicated a significant effect of treatment (F(3,276) = 25.39, p < 0.0001) and treatment x time interaction (F(33,276) = 3.84, p < 0.0001). Further post hoc analysis showed a significant effect at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min (p < 0.05) (Figure 2c). This data suggests that Mesyl Sal B suppresses the expression of cocaine behavioral sensitization in rats. No changes in stereotypic counts were observed between any of these groups (data not shown).Mesyl Sal B has previously been shown to have antinociceptive effects in the warm-water tail withdrawal assay in mice at 1 mg/kg, i.p. with a 60 min duration of action compared to 15 min for Sal A. Results from in vitro cellular assays show that U50488, Sal A, and Mesyl Sal B are all full agonists at KOPr, therefore, in the present study, the warm-water tail withdrawal assay was used to assess the dose-response effects in vivo. A non-linear regression analysis showed that a different curve fit each treatment (F(6,93) = 14.43, p < 0.0001) (Figure 3). Mesyl Sal B (EC50 = 3.0 mg/kg) only exerted partial effects in the warm-water tail withdrawal assay in comparison to U50488 (EC50 = 6.7 mg/kg) and Sal A (EC50 = 2.1 mg/kg). Interestingly, the efficacy of Mesyl Sal B (Emax = 38%) was significantly reduced compared to the traditional agonist U50488 (p = 0.0064), whereas Sal A (Emax = 87%) was not significantly different to U50488 (p > 0.9999). Therefore, it appears that Mesyl Sal B has minimal effects on thermal antinociception, with a reduced potency and efficacy compared to both Sal A and U50488.To fully evaluate the effects of Mesyl Sal B on pain behaviors, we utilized the intraplantar 2% formaldehyde model of phase 1 nociceptive pain (0–15 min) and phase 2 inflammatory pain (20–60 min) in mice. While Sal A (2 mg/kg) showed significant attenuation of the phase 1 and phase 2 pain responses (F(33,220) = 3.169, p < 0.0001) (Figure 4a), Mesyl Sal B was minimally effective at attenuating phase 1 at 2 mg/kg dosages (F(33,220) = 4.28, p < 0.0001), reducing phase 2 pain at the 30 min time point for the 2 mg/kg dose (p = 0.0009; Figure 4b). The lower 1 mg/kg dose of Mesyl Sal B dose showed a small but significant decrease at 10 (p = 0.0104) and 60 min (p = 0.0059). The limited effectiveness of Mesyl Sal B in this nociceptive and inflammatory pain is consistent with no significant reduction in the formaldehyde-induced edema, whereas the 2 mg/kg dose of Sal A significantly reduced the paw edema (p = 0.0426; Figure 4c).Reduced responses to pleasurable stimuli such as sucrose is a preclinical measure of anhedonia. The traditional KOPr agonist U50488 has been shown to reduce the sucrose intake and seeking at 5 and 10 mg/kg. We assessed the effect of Mesyl Sal B on sucrose-reinforced responding. Figure 5 shows that Mesyl Sal B at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg had no effect on the sucrose intake in male Sprague Dawley rats (F(2,18) = 1.113, p = 0.3501).Recognition memory has been shown to be impaired by stress and is also induced via KOPr dependent mechanisms and following administration of U50488. Figure 6a shows a decrease in recognition index times following U50488 (10 mg/kg/i.p.), that was prevented by the prior administration of the KOPr agonist nor-BNI (F(1.62,9.311) = 8.394, p = 0.0089). In contrast, neither Sal A (Figure 6b), nor Mesyl Sal B (0.3 or 1 mg/kg) (Figure 6c) produced any impairment in memory in the novel object recognition task.The rotarod performance test was used to assess the motor coordination of mice following an i.p. injection of the vehicle, Sal A, or Mesyl Sal B. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant interaction of treatment x time for the Mesyl Sal B experiment (F(12,96) = 0.1391 p = 0.9997). However, following Sal A administration, there was a significant treatment x time interaction (F(6,72) = 2.774, p = 0.0175). Sal A at a dose of 2 mg/kg showed a short-acting but significant motor impairment in the rotarod test in mice at 2 (p = 0.0005) and 15 min (p = 0.0039), whereas, Mesyl Sal B showed no motor impairment over a 90 min time period at either 1 or 2 mg/kg doses (Figure 7).To determine the effects of Mesyl Sal B on aversion, we used two behavioral models, CTA and CPA. In tests measuring conditioned place aversion in rats, U50488 caused significant aversion to the paired chamber (p < 0.05), whereas Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the amount of time spent in the drug-paired chamber (p = 0.767) (Figure 8a). Additional evaluation of the aversive effects of KOPr agonists utilized CTA tests in rats to compare the aversive effects of Mesyl Sal B with Sal A. Figure 8c shows the amount of novel tasting saccharin solution (0.1%) consumed by rats on test day with either Sal A or Mesyl Sal B pre-treatment and compared to vehicle-treated controls (F(2,16) = 0.1154, p = 0.8918). Acute exposure to Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) did not induce taste aversion in rats further supporting the absence of aversive effects with Mesyl Sal B.The FST measures despair-like behaviors. Figure 9a shows the effect of the acute exposure of Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) on forced swimming behaviors in rats. Mesyl Sal B pre-treated rats showed a significant decrease in the swimming time (p = 0.006) and a significant increase in the time spent immobile (p = 0.006) compared to vehicle pre-treated controls. This indicated that pro-depressive effects are produced by Mesyl Sal B in rats at doses that attenuated the effects of cocaine.Time spent in the open-arm during a 5 min test in EPM tests is a preclinical model of anxiety, with decreases in open-arm times consistent with anxiogenic effects. Figure 9b reveals that Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) has no effect on the time spent in the open arm (p > 0.9999) whereas Sal A (1 mg/kg), significantly decreased the time spent in the open arm (p = 0.0435).","Sal A was the first naturally-occurring non-nitrogenous KOPr agonist to be discovered. The compound was isolated as the active ingredient of Salvia divinorum, a psychoactive plant native to Mexico. Sal A has been shown to have anti-rewarding and antinociceptive effects in preclinical models, although Sal A is unsuitable for further development in the clinic due to its hallucinogenic and aversive properties, as well as a short duration of action. However, analogues of Sal A have been developed, with the intention of improving the pharmacokinetic profile and reducing the side-effects. We have previously shown that Mesyl Sal B has a longer duration of action using the warm-water tail withdrawal assay in mice, however, the underlying cellular signaling profile had not been previously assessed. Recently, there has been much interest in the concept of biased signaling, whereby the KOPr can preferentially activate desired G-protein signaling pathways associated with the therapeutic effects, rather than the β-arrestin2 pathways associated with some of the negative side-effects. In the present study, we have shown that Mesyl Sal B has a G-protein biased signaling profile (Table 1). Interestingly, in these cellular assays, Sal A also displays G-protein bias, which is in contrast to previous studies, although we have used different cell lines and functional assays to evaluate the signaling pathways. For instance, Sal A has been shown to be a balanced agonist in human embryonic kidney cells, whereas the present study utilized the U2OS and CHO cell lines. In addition, the importance of understanding the biased signaling in different species has recently been highlighted. DiMattio et al. found that Sal A was significantly biased towards the β-arrestin2 pathway at the human receptor but had a similar activation of both pathways at the mouse KOPr. Furthermore, the KOPr agonist nalfurafine showed extreme G-protein biased signaling at the human KOPr as opposed to bias to a much lesser extent at the rat KOPr. Overall, the finding that Mesyl Sal B has a G-protein bias is promising, however, further studies into the complex signaling pathways and the effects in different cell lines and species are warranted. Despite immense efforts, researchers have not yet developed a successful FDA approved pharmacotherapy for psychostimulant abuse. KOPr agonists have been identified as potential therapeutic targets as the activation of the KOPr produces anti-rewarding effects by decreasing dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. We have previously shown that Sal A and Mesyl Sal B attenuate cocaine-prime induced reinstatement of drug seeking in rats. Therefore, the current study aimed to expand the anti-cocaine profile of Mesyl Sal B to assess the effect on cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization to cocaine. Previously, U50488 and U69593 have been shown to attenuate cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization in rats, whereas Sal A suppressed cocaine sensitization but increased the locomotor activity produced by acute cocaine administration. When administered for 45 min, but not 5 or 30 min, prior to cocaine, Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) suppressed cocaine-induced hyperactivity (Figure 2). The results show that Mesyl Sal B has a prolonged onset of action in rats and is consistent with other studies demonstrating long-lasting effects in attenuating alcohol drinking behavior over 4 h and a longer duration of action in antinociceptive assays compared to Sal A. Similarly, Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) attenuated behavioral sensitization to cocaine as shown by a reduction in the total ambulatory counts (Figure 2), consistent with previous work that showed Sal A (0.3 mg/kg) attenuated cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization in rats.The Salvia divinorum plant has traditionally been used in the spiritual practice of the Maztec Indians to produce hallucinogenic experiences, as well as in treating a variety of ailments including headaches, diarrhea, and rheumatism. Sal A has been extensively tested in models of pain, showing particular efficacy in inflammatory models of nociception. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the antinociceptive effects of the Sal A analogue, Mesyl Sal B. We have previously published the warm-water tail withdrawal assay results for Mesyl Sal B showing a nociceptive duration of action of 60 min, as opposed to the 15 min duration of Sal A, indicating that Mesyl Sal B has an improved metabolic profile and bioactivity in vivo compared to Sal A. The present study used the same assay to assess the cumulative dose-response effects of the KOPr agonists. The results show that Mesyl Sal B exerts only partial effects compared to Sal A and U50488 (Figure 3), which is in contrast to the results from in vitro cellular assays showing that U50488, Sal A, and Mesyl Sal B are all full agonists at the KOPr. In comparison, another C-2 analogue of Sal A, β-tetrahydropyran Sal B, was shown to be more potent and more efficacious than Sal A using the same dose-response procedure. Similarly, the structurally-rigid spirobutyrolactone Sal B had a similar potency and efficacy in the cumulative warm-water tail withdrawal assay. The reduced in vivo efficacy of Mesyl Sal B in assays of spinal-mediated antinociception contrasts to its potent anti-cocaine effects. Both behaviors require central nervous system active drugs, therefore, the differences are not due to the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and may reflect site-specific differences in KOPr-mediated signaling pathways mediating particular behavioral effects. Interestingly, both the anti-addiction effects and the antinociceptive effects of KOPr agonists are believed to be due to G-protein signaling as the KOPr-mediated modulation of the DAT function is pertussis toxin-sensitive and dependent on the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2).To further assess the antinociceptive effects of Mesyl Sal B, the intraplantar 2% formaldehyde model of inflammatory pain was utilized. Sal A produced a significant reduction in the level of nociceptive and inflammatory pain, whilst Mesyl Sal A was effective at fewer time points (Figure 4). In addition, Sal A reduced the formaldehyde-induced paw edema, whereas Mesyl Sal B did not (Figure 4). This data contrasts with previous studies on C-2 modified Sal A analogues, including β-tetrahydropyran Sal B, that produced potent antinociceptive effects in the intraplantar 2% formaldehyde model. The spirobutyrolactone Sal B analogue had potent antinociceptive effects in the inflammatory phase of the intraplantar 2% formaldehyde assay and significantly reduced formaldehyde-induced paw edema, however, did not reduce the nociceptive phase of pain. The previously published warm-water tail withdrawal data does show that Mesyl Sal B has a longer onset of action, with effects only seen from 30–60 min. Since the present study only had a pretreatment time of 5 min, a greater antinociceptive effect may have been produced with a longer pretreatment period, however, this does not fully explain the lack of efficacy in the inflammatory phase of pain.The combined results from the spinally-mediated thermal model and the nociceptive and inflammatory phases of pain in the intraplantar formaldehyde model confirms the limited antinociceptive effects of Mesyl Sal B. These findings may indicate that the substitution of a mesylate group at the C-2 position results in differences in the downstream signaling pathways, however, further investigations into the in vitro pharmacology of Mesyl Sal B are warranted.To develop clinically viable anti-cocaine or antinociceptive therapeutics, novel KOPr agonists need to have reduced side-effects compared to the traditional agonists U50488 and U69593, as well as the parent compound Sal A. Anhedonia is a side-effect associated with KOPr activation, which has been attributed to decreased levels of dopamine within the nucleus accumbens. In preclinical models, anhedonia can be measured by a reduction in responses to a pleasurable stimulus such as sucrose. The traditional KOPr agonists, U50488 and spiradoline, suppress water consumption at the same doses that attenuate cocaine self-administration in rats (5, 10 mg/kg). In addition, intravenous infusions of bremazocine (0.0032 mg/kg/h), enadoline (0.001, 0.0032 mg/kg/h), ethylketazocine (0.01, 0.0032 mg/kg/h), and U50488 (0.1 mg/kg/h) not only decreased cocaine self-administration but also food reinforcements in rhesus monkeys. In the present study, we have shown that Mesyl Sal B (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) had no effect on sucrose intake (Figure 5). This finding is supported by another study showing Mesyl Sal B at a higher dose of 3 mg/kg had no effect on sucrose or saccharin intake in mice. Previous studies performed using Sal A also show no effects on sucrose self-administration at 0.3 mg/kg. The lack of anhedonia effects exhibited by Mesyl Sal B contrast to the effects seen with the more potent Sal A analogue 2-methoxy methyl Sal A (MOM Sal B). MOM Sal B attenuates sucrose reinforcement in rats at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. However, since we also evaluated Mesyl Sal B at a higher dose of 1 mg/kg, these effects cannot be solely attributed to the increased potency of MOM Sal B. Other studies have also shown mixed effects of KOPr agonists on sucrose intake, with U50488 (administered intracerebroventricular) showing increased sucrose intake in rats, highlighting potential differences between different KOPr agonists in modulating natural reward behaviors. However, we have shown that Mesyl Sal B attenuates cocaine-induced behaviors without inducing anhedonia-like adverse effects in laboratory animals.To further assess the side-effects of Mesyl Sal B, a novel object task was utilized as a measure of recognition memory. Animal studies have found that the endogenous KOPr agonist dynorphin causes spatial memory impairment and KOPr activation is responsible for stress-induced learning and memory impairments. We have shown that U50488 (10 mg/kg) leads to a decrease in the recognition index in the novel object recognition task (Figure 6). In contrast, neither Sal A nor Mesyl Sal B (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg) produced any learning and memory impairments (Figure 6). These results are consistent with previous studies showing U50488 induces memory impairment in the passive avoidance test in mice. Furthermore, disruption of the novel object recognition task has been shown previously for U50488 administered at 0.3 and 5.0 mg/kg in mice, suggesting that the disruption of cognitive function occurs at a wide range of doses, including at doses that do not impair motor coordination. Part of the pathway involved in long-term memory formation and retrieval is cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), however, different isoforms of CREB can either enhance or impair memory. Following KOPr activation, CREB is induced as part of the β-arrestin2 pathway, whereas the G-protein pathway leads to a reduction in cAMP and, therefore, inhibits CREB activation. This suggests that the balanced KOPr agonist U50488 may activate the isoform of CREB associated with the repression of memory via the β-arrestin2 signaling cascade. We have shown that Sal A and Mesyl Sal B are G-protein biased (Table 1), perhaps explaining the lack of memory impairment.Another side-effect associated with the activation of the KOPr is motor incoordination or sedation. Using the inverted screen test to evaluate motor coordination in mice, Sal A (0.5–2 mg/kg) and U69593 (1 mg/kg) have been shown to rapidly disrupt climbing behavior, however, the effects were short-lived. Similarly, Sal A (3–10 mg/kg) induced motor incoordination in the rotarod performance test for 30 min, compared to the G-protein biased agonist RB-64 that did not cause any motor deficits. In Rhesus macaques, Sal A (0.01–0.1 mg/kg i.v.) had a sedative effect, as measured by an unresponsiveness to environmental stimuli and postural relaxation. In the current study, the rotarod performance test was also used to assess motor coordination in mice. Sal A (2 mg/kg) showed a short-acting but significant motor impairment in the rotarod test at 2–15 min, whereas, Mesyl Sal B (1 and 2 mg/kg) showed no motor impairment over a 90 min time period (Figure 7). This data is consistent with the effects of Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) on spontaneous open field activity in drug naïve rats, where there was no significant effect of Mesyl Sal B on locomotor activity. However, in the same open field test, we previously showed that Sal A (0.3 mg/kg) did not alter spontaneous locomotion in rats, indicating that the differences in sedative effects only occur at higher doses. These results show that Mesyl Sal B has no motor coordination impairments in mice when compared to the same dosage of the parent compound Sal A.Previous studies have used CPA to measure the aversive properties of the traditional KOPr agonists U69593 and U50488. Sal A has previously been shown to have no aversion in CTA experiments at 0.3 mg/kg, and conditioned place preference at low doses (0.1–40 μg/kg) but aversion at higher doses in rats (0.16–1 mg/kg) and in mice (1–3.2 mg/kg). While we confirm the aversive properties of U50488 (10 mg/kg) (Figure 8a) seen in previous studies, Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) had no effects on either place aversion (Figure 8b) or taste aversion (Figure 8c). Similar results were found for another more potent Sal A analogue, 2-ethoxymethyl ether Sal B (0.1 mg/kg), which did not show aversive effects in the CPA paradigm. This further supports the proposition that it is possible to modulate drug-seeking at doses that do not have aversive effects, with both Sal A and Mesyl Sal B showing no significant aversive effects. Furthermore, the anxiogenic effect of Mesyl Sal B was measured using the EPM model. Interestingly, Sal A (0.16 mg/kg) has previously been shown to have anxiolytic effects in rats. However, Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg), in contrast to Sal A (1 mg/kg), did not reduce the time spent on the open arm (Figure 9). The lack of effects on Mesyl Sal B in EPM is further evidence that unique structural Sal A analogues, such as Mesyl Sal B, have differences in preclinical behavior models that cannot be easily correlated to potency and efficacy in vitro.Finally, the despair-like behaviors were measured in the FST model of pro-depressive effects. Mesyl Sal B reduced the swimming time and increased immobile behaviors, indicating pro-depressive effects at the same dose that attenuated cocaine behaviors (Figure 9). Previous findings show that Sal A (0.25–2 mg/kg) induces depressive effects without suppressing locomotion activity in rats. Similarly, another Sal A analogue, MOM Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) showed pro-depressive effects, whereas 2-ethoxymethyl ether Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) and β-tetrahydropyran Sal B (2 mg/kg) did not. Since a reduction in swimming time is related to the modulation in serotonin transporter function, depressive effects produced by these novel neoclerodanes may also involve alterations in central serotonin systems. However, the results are complicated and the pro-depressive effects should be interpreted with caution, as Sal A (10–1000 μg/kg) has been shown to have both potent anti-depressive and anxiolytic effects in rats in previous studies.KOPr agonists have great potential as anti-addictive or analgesic therapeutics, however, the aversive side-effects have prevented their clinical development. Several strategies have been employed to reduce the side-effect profile of KOPr agonists, including the development of G-protein biased agonists and peripherally restricted KOPr agonists. Nalfurafine, a potent and selective KOPr agonist is the first KOPr agonist to be approved for use in humans, currently being prescribed to hemodialysis patients for the treatment of medication-resistant pruritus. Importantly, nalfurafine was recently found to be extremely G-protein biased at the human KOPr, and has little abuse potential. In the present study, we identified that Mesyl Sal B was G-protein biased (Table 1), perhaps explaining the reduced side-effect profile. However, we only assessed one G-protein signaling pathway (inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation) and one β-arrestin pathway (β-arrestin2 recruitment). To gain a further understanding of the signaling pathways involved and the bias factor, more downstream proteins could be evaluated to create a ‘web of bias’ for Mesyl Sal B.","The activation of KOPr decreases dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, producing anti-rewarding effects. The psychoactive natural product Sal A is a potent and selective KOPr agonist isolated from the plant Salvia divinorum. Sal A attenuates cocaine-prime induced drug seeking in rats, however, Sal A has a short duration of action and is associated with negative side-effects, which has prevented its clinical development. The Sal A analogue, Mesyl Sal B, has a mesylate substitution at the C-2 position and has a similar binding affinity for the KOPr compared to Sal A and U69593. We have previously shown that Mesyl Sal B has a longer duration of action in the warm-water tail withdrawal assay in mice and Mesyl Sal B attenuates cocaine-prime drug seeking in rats. Therefore, we aimed to further assess the anti-cocaine effects of Mesyl Sal B, as well as the side-effect profile and any potential antinociceptive effects.We have determined that Mesyl Sal B has increased potency in vitro compared to U50488 in an assay measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, whereas, Mesyl Sal B has similar potency and efficacy to U50488 in an assay measuring β-arrestin2 recruitment. Together, this indicates that Mesyl Sal B has G-protein biased signaling in vitro. The behavioral effects of Mesyl Sal B in vivo are also unique. Mesyl Sal B was effective at attenuating cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization to cocaine at similar doses to Sal A. In addition, Mesyl Sal B had fewer side-effects than Sal A and U50488 at the dose that modulated the cocaine behaviors. Mesyl Sal B produced no motor defects in the rotarod performance task; no memory impairment in the novel recognition task; no anxiety on the EPM; or aversion in the CTA or CPA tests. However, pro-depressive effects were observed in the FST. In contrast to Sal A, Mesyl Sal B was ineffective in behavioral models of antinociception. The cumulative dose-response effects in the warm-water tail withdrawal assay showed Mesyl Sal B only had a partial efficacy. This lack of antinociceptive efficacy was confirmed in the intraplantar formaldehyde model of inflammatory pain, where the effects of Mesyl Sal B were limited in comparison to Sal A. Overall, this study demonstrated that structurally novel Sal A analogues, such as Mesyl Sal B, have unique behavioral and cellular signaling properties, demonstrating that KOPr-mediated anti-rewarding effects, antinociceptive effects, and side-effects can be distinct. This holds promise for the development of KOPr therapeutics with fewer side-effects."

The present study analyzed cellproliferation and cell apoptosis by MTT and FITC‑Annexin V assays. The proteinlevels of caveolin‑1 (Cav‑1) and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD)1 weredetermined by western blotting, and the interaction of Cav1 and HSC70 wasinvestigated by co‑immunoprecipitation experiments. The present study found thatsclareol inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Twocancer‑associated proteins, Cav1 and SOD1 were identified as potential targets ofsclareol in HeLa cells. The expression of Cav1 increased when the cells weretreated with sclareol, and the protein level of SOD1 was negatively correlatedwith Cav1. The overexpression of Cav1 enhanced the sensitivity of the HeLa cellsto sclareol treatment and downregulated the protein level of SOD1, whichexhibited potential associations between Cav1 and SOD1. In addition, sclareolsignificantly sensitized several cancer cells to the anticancer effect ofbortezomib by targeting Cav1 and SOD1. Taken together, the results of the presentstudy demonstrated that sclareol inhibited tumor cell growth through theupregulation of Cav1, and provides a potential therapeutic target for humancancer.","Zhang, Ting, Wang, Ting, Cai, Peiling",2017,Molecular medicine reports,2,False,False,True,"Cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in women worldwide. In developing countries, it is the most common cause of cancer-associated mortality, and the five-year survival rate for patients with advanced cervical cancer is low. Thus, it is important to identify and examine effective drugs in cervical cancer treatment. It has long been reported that sclareol, a labdane-type diterpene isolated from the Salvia sclarea plant can inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of several cancer cell lines. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the antitumorigenic effect of sclareol in cervical carcinoma remain to be elucidated.Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is an important component of caveolae and is known to function as a scaffolding protein in the regulation of several signaling pathways. The loss of Cav1 has been demonstrated to be involved in the tumorigenesis of several types of cancer, and the overexpression of Cav1 has been shown to inhibit cell and tumor growth. Thus Cav1 is regarded as a potential tumor suppressor. Although numerous studies have been performed investigating the function of Cav1 in several types of cancer, the exact role of Cav1 in cervical carcinoma remains to be elucidated.Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is an essential element of the superoxide radical eliminating system. It is the most abundant anti-oxidant enzyme and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, although its localization in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and nucleus has also been reported. Previous studies have revealed that SOD1 is overexpressed in various types of cancer, and that the downregulation of SOD1 leads to cancer cell death, which indicates that SOD1 is important in tumorigenesis.In the present study, the anticancer effect of sclareol was investigated, and the expression levels of Cav1 and SOD1 in a cervical cancer cell line were investigated, in order to elucidate the potential mechanisms involved in the anticancer effect of sclareol.","HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA).

A 10 µl volume of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to the 100 µl medium in each well. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 h, following which the supernatant was removed and 100 µl DMSO was added to each well. The absorbance signals were measured on a spectrophotometer at 490 nm. The cell death-inducing effects of drug treatment were measured using a CF488A-Annexin V and Propidium Iodide (PI) Apoptosis Assay kit (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). The samples and assays were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and then mounted onto slides. Images were captured with a Nikon fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).Samples were collected with 1X SDS sample buffer and were separated by 10–12% SDS-PAGE (20 µg/lane). The proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Protein quantification was performed using a BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The membrane was first blocked with 5% milk for 1 h, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: Cav 1 (cat. no. 16447-1-AP; 1:1,000; ProteinTech Group, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), SOD1 (cat. no. 10269-1-AP; 1:1,000; ProteinTech Group, Inc.), β-tubilin (cat. no. 66240-1; 1:2,000; ProteinTech Group, Inc.), p62 (cat. no. 18420-1-AP; 1:1,000; ProteinTech Group, Inc.), LC3 (cat. no.

C29F4; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) diluted in the same blocking buffer. Following three washes with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.2% Tween 20, the blot was incubated with Dylight 680/800-conjugated secondary antibodies (cat. nos. 042-06-15-06 and 042-06-18-0; 1:10,000; KPL, Inc. Gaithersburg, MD, USA) in the dark for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was then washed again with TBST and images were captured using a Li-Cor Odyssey Clx infrared imaging system (LI-COR BioSciences, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA).For the stable expression of Cav-1, the HeLa cells were transduced with Cav1-Flag lentiviral particles using ViraPower Lentiviral Expression system following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol, and stable cell lines were selected using blasticidin (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).At 24 h post-transduction, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 1% NP40 lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. The cell lysates were collected in an EP tube and then centrifuged at >18,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the Flag (1:1,000) and HA tag (1:1,000) antibodies overnight at 4°C. Prewashed protein A/G-agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) were then added to the supernatant and incubated for another 2 h at 4°C. The immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer three times, resuspended in sample buffer and then subjected to western blot analysis.The cells were plated on coverslips at a density of 1.0×105 cells and transfected with the indicated plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000. HeLa cells and HeLa cells stably transfected with Cav1-Flag (Cav1) were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing lysosome-associated protein 2A (Lamp-2A)-EGFP. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-x-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Following rinsing with PBS three times, the cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore) overnight at 4°C.

The cells were then rinsed, mounted and sealed. Images were captured using an Olympus confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).The full-length Cav1 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a BamHI site-containing 5′ primer and an XbaI site-containing 3′ primer, and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+)-flag vector (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) between the BamHI and XbaI sites to generate the Cav1-Flag expression construct. The full-length heat-shock protein cognate 70 (HSC70) ORF was amplified by PCR with a BamHI site-containing 5′ primer and an XbaI site-containing 3′ primer, and cloned between the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.1(+)-HA vector to generate the HSC70-HA expression construct. Full-length LAMP-2A ORF was amplified by PCR with a BamHI site-containing 5′ primer and an XbaI site-containing 3′ primer, and cloned between the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.1(+)-EGFP vector to generate the LAMP-2A-EGFP expression construct. The human cDNA preserved in the laboratory was utilized as the template. Flag tag, HA tag and EGFP tag were cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Life Technologies; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) between XbaI and ApaI to generate the pcDNA3.1(+)-tagged vector. For the generation of Cav1Flag lentiviral particles, the Cav1-Flag cDNA fragment was inserted into a pLenti6 lentiviral vector (Invitrogen Life Technologies; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and the resultant plasmid was co-transfected with ViraPower Lentiviral Packaging mix (Invitrogen Life Technologies; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) into HEK293FT cells with Lipofectamine 2000.

The sequences of the primers are listed in Table I.Experimental data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean. Data analyses were performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Differences between groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.","In the present study, HeLa cells were used to investigate the anticancer effects of sclareol in cervical carcinoma. An MTT assay was first performed to measure the viability of the HeLa cells. The cells were treated with sclareol for 24, 48 and 72 h, and cell viability was measured at each time point. The results showed that sclareol significantly inhibited the proliferation of the HeLa cells, and the inhibitory effect was time-dependent (Fig. 1A). In addition, when the cells were treated with different concentrations of sclareol, the proliferation of the HeLa cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B).Treatment with sclareol also induced the apoptosis of the HeLa cells. An Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/PI staining assay was used to assess the proportion of apoptotic cells when HeLa cells were treated with sclareol for indicated durations. The results indicated that the Annexin V-FITC-positive and PI-positive cells were significantly increased in a time-dependent manner when treated with sclareol (Fig. 1C and D).As the exact mechanism involved in the anticancer effect of sclareol remains to be fully elucidated, the present study examined the expression of various cancer-associated proteins to identify the potential target of sclareol. The cells were exposed to sclareol for 24, 48 and 72 h, and were then subjected to western blot analysis. The results showed that sclareol induced the protein levels of Cav1 in a time-dependent manner, compared with the control group (Fig. 2A and B).SOD1 has previously been identified as a novel cancer gene. The results of the present study showed that the protein level of SOD1 was significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner when treated with sclareol (Fig. 2A and B), and the decreased expression of SOD1 was negatively correlated with the increased expression of Cav1.The present study established a HeLa cell line stably expressing Cav1. The stable Cav1-expressing cell line and normal HeLa cells were treated with vehicle or sclareol at the indicated concentration for 24 h, following which the cell viability was measured using an MTT assay. It was found that stable expression of Cav1 enhanced the sensitivity of the cells to sclareol treatment (Fig. 2C and D). These results indicated that the upregulation of Cav1 was responsible for the anticancer effect of sclareol.It was previously demonstrated that SOD1 is important in cancer development, whereas Cav1 has been reported to be a cancer suppressor. As shown in Fig. 2, the present study found that SOD1 was negatively correlated with Cav1. To determine whether the expression of SOD1 was directly regulated by Cav1, HeLa cells overexpressing Flag-tagged Cav1 were established, and western blot analysis was performed to determine the protein level of SOD1. The results showed that the overexpression of Cav1 significantly promoted the downregulation of SOD1 (Fig. 3A and B). In the HeLa cell line stably expressing Cav1, it was found that stable expression of Cav1 enhanced the downregulation of SOD1 when treated with sclareol (Fig. 3C and D).Previous investigations have revealed that Cav1 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. As the results of the present study showed that sclareol inhibited cancer cell proliferation through the upregulation of Cav1, whether bortezomib, an anticancer drug and a proteasome inhibitor, enhances the anticancer effect of sclareol was investigated. The HeLa cells were treated with sclareol only, bortezomib only or sclareol and bortezomib together, and subjected to western blot analysis and an MTT assay. By measuring the cell viability of each group, it was found that sclareol significantly enhanced the antiproliferative effect of bortezomib, compared with the cells treated with either drug separately (Fig. 4A). The results of the western blot analysis showed that the protein level of Cav1 increased following treatment with bortezomib (Fig. 4B and C). In addition, the HeLa cells treated with sclareol and bortezomib together exhibited a lower level of SOD1 and higher level of Cav1, compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 4B and C). Similar results were observed when other cancer cells were treated with the drug combination of bortezomib and sclareol (Fig. 4D).Previous reports have shown that Cav1 mediates the degradation of several proteins, thus it is possible that Cav1 promotes the degradation of SOD1. HSC70 and LAMP-2A are two important components of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The present study found that Cav1 not only colocalized with LAMP-2A (Fig. 5A) but also interacted with HSC70 (Fig. 5B and C), thus it is possible that Cav1 may be involved in CMA-mediated protein degradation. CMA substrates are usually delivered to the lysosome for degradation. In the present study, HeLa cells were treated with sclareol only or sclareol together with lysosome inhibitors and then subjected to western blot analysis. Of note, as with p62/SQSTM1 and LC3 II, which are two autophagy-associated proteins previously reported to be degraded in lysosomes, inhibition of lysosome activity suppressed the downregulation of SOD1 caused by sclareol treatment (Fig. 5D-G), which suggested that sclareol treatment may promote the downregulation of SOD1 through lysosome mediated degradation via Cav1.","Sclareol exhibits antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity against various human cancer cell lines, and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. The anticancer effect of sclareol has long been reported, however, the exact role of sclareol and its molecular mechanisms in cervical carcinoma remain to be elucidated. The present study demonstrated that sclareol inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, and the combination of sclareol with another anticancer drug, bortezomib, significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in several types of cancer cell. It was also shown that sclareol treatment induced the expression of Cav1 in HeLa cells.Although the role of Cav1 in tumorigenesis is controversial, increasing evidence indicates that Cav1 functions as a tumor suppressor in various types of cancer. The downregulation of Cav1 has been implicated in the development and progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, lung carcinoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, colon cancer, sporadic vestibular schwannomas and breast cancer. The overexpression of Cav1 decreases tumor cell growth and enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. However, the exact function of Cav1 in cervical carcinoma remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the upregulation of Cav1 correlated with decreased cell viability under sclareol treatment, which indicated that Cav1 may function as a tumor suppressor in HeLa cells.Cav1 is ubiquitinated and targeted to lysosomes for degradation, and previous studies have demonstrated that Cav-1 is also a molecular target of bortezomib, which is involved in antitumorigenesis and proteasome inhibition, and is degraded through the proteasome pathway. The data obtained in the present study showed that sclareol increased the protein level of Cav1, and the combined treatment with bortezomib further enhanced the expression of Cav1. Based on these findings, it is possible that the combination of sclareol with bortezomib may have novel synergistic antitumor effects via upregulation of the cancer suppressor, Cav1. In line with this hypothesis, the present study found that bortezomib synergized with sclareol to reduce the viability of various types of cancer cell, including HeLa, HepG2, MCF-7, SW480 and SW620 cells, whereas treatment with bortezomib or sclareol alone at the same concentration had markedly lower inhibitory effects. Thus, the combination of bortezomib with sclareol may be a novel and promising approach in cancer therapy.Previous reports have revealed the potential mechanism involved in the anticancer effect of Cav1. Cav-1 has been shown to prevent cancer growth via inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and to enhance the degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In the present study, the increased protein level of Cav1 was negatively correlated with the expression of SOD1, and the overexpression of Cav1 significantly suppressed the protein level of SOD1. These findings indicated a potential association between Cav1 and SOD1.The expression of SOD1 has been linked to the resistance of cancer cells to pro-oxidant drugs and the anticancer drug. bortezomib, which raises the possibility that an SOD1 inhibitor can be used, not only as an antitumorigenic drug, but also as a molecule to challenge the drug resistance of cancer cells. The data obtained in the present study showed that the treatment of HeLa cells with sclareol led to downregulation of the protein level of SOD1, whereas the overexpression of Cav1 enhanced the suppressed expression of SOD1. These findings suggested that sclareol may function as an SOD1 inhibitor via the upregulation of Cav1. As the first anticancer drug to function as a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib has been approved for the clinical treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, and has also been demonstrated to be an effective cell growth inhibitor in various cancer cell lines. However, the emergence of drug resistance has seriously affected the therapeutic effect of bortezomib. The overexpression of SOD1 has been shown to increase the resistance of cancer cells to bortezomib, and the results of the present study showed that combined sclareol and bortezomib treatment resulted in markedly lower protein levels of SOD1, compared with bortezomib treatment alone, which suggested that combined sclareol and bortezomib treatment may be a promising therapy in overcoming the challenge of bortezomib resistance.Cav1 is important in Derlin-1- and p97-mediated cyclooxygenase-2 ubiquitination and degradation, and previous reports have shown that Cav1 enhances the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR via endocytosis. However, how Cav1 promotes the suppressed expression of SOD1 remains to be fully elucidated. The present study found that inhibition of the lysosome rescued the decreased protein level of SOD1, which was induced by sclareol, thus Cav1 may interact with SOD1 to facilitate its degradation inside the lysosome. However, the protein level of SOD1 cannot be fully rescued by lysosome inhibition, which indicates Cav1 is not the only molecule to promote the degradation of SOD1 and that SOD1 is not only degraded by the lysosome-mediated pathway. Further detailed investigation is required to elucidate the exact mechanism involved.In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the inhibitory effect of sclareol on the proliferation of HeLa cells. In addition, it was found that the anticancer effect of sclareol was enhanced when combined with bortezomib, which was demonstrated in various cancer cells. Further investigations revealed that the tumor suppressor, Cav1, enhanced the decreased expression of SOD1, which may be responsible for the anticancer effect of sclareol. These findings not only elucidated the potential mechanisms underlying the anticancer effect of sclareol, but also provided a novel and promising approach for cancer therapy and resolving drug resistance in cancer cells.",
54,TA039996,10.1186/s12870-024-04933-9,Metabolomics analysis reveals the metabolite profiles of Rheum tanguticum grownunder different altitudinal gradients.,"BACKGROUND: Plant growth and quality are often affected by environmental factors,including geographical location, climate, and soil. In this study, we describethe effect of altitudinal differences on the growth and active ingredients inRheum tanguticum Maxim. ex Balf. (R. tanguticum), a traditional Chinese medicinalherb known for its laxative properties. RESULTS: The results showed that plantsgrown at lower altitudes had better growth performances than those in higheraltitude areas. The yield varied by 2.45-23.68 times with altitude, reaching amaximum of 102.01 t/ha. In addition, total anthraquinone and total sennosidecontents decreased with increasing altitude, whereas total tannins increased withincreasing altitude. The total anthraquinone content of the indicator compoundreached 5.15% at five experimental sites, which exceeded the ChinesePharmacopoeia standard by 70.87%. The content of the other two categories ofactive ingredients reached a maximum value of 0.94% (total sennosides) and 2.65%(total tannins). Redundancy analysis revealed that annual rainfall, annualaverage temperature, annual sunshine hours, and pH significantly affected growthand active ingredients. Moreover, key metabolites, such as flavonoids, aminoacids and their derivatives, phenolic acids, lipids, and terpenes, weredifferentially expressed between samples from low- and high-altitude cultivationareas. These metabolites were enriched in the flavonoid and flavonol biosyntheticpathway and the monoterpene biosynthetic pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These resultssuggest that high anthraquinone content was observed in the lowest-latitudecultivation area due to low rainfall and alkaline soil pH. Key metabolites weresignificantly upregulated in high-latitude cultivation areas. These resultsprovide a scientific basis for quality control and the systematic cultivation ofR. tanguticum.","Wang, Lingling, Zhao, Shuo, Li, Jianan, Zhou, Guoying",2024,BMC plant biology,2,True,True,True,"Rhubarb is a perennial herb in the family Polygonaceae. Its dried roots and rhizomes are used as medicine and have been shown to be effective in purging heat, dredging intestines, cooling blood, detoxifying, removing blood stasis and stimulating menstruation. Rhubarb’s medicinal value has been documented in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) classics, such as Treatise on Febrile Diseases and Miscellaneous Diseases and Four Medical Codes. The results of modern pharmacological studies have revealed some of its other activities, including anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity, as well as its ability to lower blood fat levels and protect the kidneys. Rhubarb has been widely used for thousands of years in China and many countries around the world and has been included in the national pharmacopoeias of China, the United States, Japan and other countries. Rheum tanguticum Maxim. ex Balf. (R. tanguticum), one of the three “genuine rhubarb” species recorded in the Pharmacopoeia, is mainly distributed in Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai and other places that is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The climate and geographical characteristics of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau endow R. tanguticum with precious bioactive compounds. The distinctive pharmacological properties of R. tanguticum have made it widely popular in in the market. Due to the increasing market demand and the negative impact on natural populations, efforts have been made to cultivate R. tanguticum in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. This become an important source of revenue for farmers,, especially for high-altitude areas where agricultural outputs were low and options for income generation were largely dependent on natural resources.In contrast than wild products, the yields of cultivated plants are able to consistently meet market demands and protect wild R. tanguticum resources. However, the quality of cultivated products from different origins varies due to differences in geography, harvesting years, and processing methods. Xiong et al. studied the metabolites of R. tanguticum in canopy-covered and open habitats and found that different habitats and ecotypes result in differences in targeted metabolites. R. tanguticum grown in understory environments exhibits better medicinal properties. In another study on the composition of R. tanguticum from different sources, results indicated that R. tanguticum samples from Qinghai had higher levels of active ingredients than those from Gansu and Sichuan provinces. It has been suggested that the anthraquinone content of two-year-old R. tanguticum reached the standard of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. At three years old, the anthraquinone content was significantly higher than that of two-year-old R. tanguticum. Therefore, effectively distinguishing R. tanguticum from different cultivation regions is imperative for accurate quality control of its products. Metabolomics can be used to effectively address this problem through comprehensive analysis of plant extracts and lead to the overall evaluation of the quality of traditional Chinese medicinal products. Previous studies have used widely targeted metabolomics to decipher changes in nutrient composition in plants grown under different environments. Li et al. applied wide-target metabolomics to reveal changes and the dynamic accumulation of metabolites in walnut and hickory seed coats, while Lin et al. accurately identified differentially abundant metabolites in aconite cultivated in Anxian and Jiangyou by using metabolomics. These differential compounds contribute to origin tracing and quality identification in aconite. With the widespread adoption of UPLC-Q-TOP/MS technology and its integration with multivariate statistical methods such as partial least squares discriminant analysis, metabolomics techniques can be better used to identify differential substances among samples. UPLC‒MS/MS is considered a feasible approach for the accurate quantification of the quality of R. tanguticum cultivated in different regions. R. tanguticum grows in areas at altitudes of 1800–4300 m, and the cultivation environment is closely related to its growth performance and quality. The soil, temperature, moisture and light characteristics prevalent during the cultivation of medicinal materials leads to differences in growth forms and in the chemical composition of target plants. Liu et al. found that high-altitude environments significantly increase the yield and quality of Pseudostellaria heterophylla. In another study, Nadeem et al. found a negative correlation between plant morphological characteristics, including height, stem diameter and leaf area, and elevation in ​​Podophyllum hexandrum Royle. Worku et al. analyzed the effect of altitude on the biochemical composition of Coffea arabica L. and found that caffeine and chlorogenic acid contents decreased with increasing altitude. Although there have been studies on cultivation techniques such as fertilization and density for R. tanguticum, as well as the application of metabolomics to explore differential compounds under different treatments, further research is needed to investigate the effect of altitude on the growth and pharmacological activity as well as metabolite profiles of R. tanguticum.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of altitudinal gradients on growth indicators and the active ingredient content of R. tanguticum. We employed widely targeted metabolomics analysis to analyze differentially abundant metabolites and enriched pathways in R. tanguticum across different altitudes and then applied a redundancy analysis method to reveal potential relationships among growth characteristics, active ingredients, metabolites and environmental factors. Through evaluating the phenotype and components of R. tanguticum, we can uncover its growth pattern at altitude. So as to achieve the goal of improving the quality of medicinal materials.Taken together, the results of this study provide a theoretical basis for evaluating quality and cultivation site selection for R. tanguticum. This contributes to the protection of wild resources, maintains ecological balance, and provides sustainable economic benefits to farmers.","R. tanguticum plants, at four ages, were collected from five experimental sites, namely, Ledu (LD, 2016 m), Minhe (MH, 2180 m), Datong (DT, 2409 m), Huzhu (HZ, 2971 m), and Guoluo (GL, 3763 m), in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau region in eastern Qinghai Province, China. The age of plants used in this study ranged from 2 to 5 years as follows: 2, 3, 4 and 5 years in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The samples were identified as R. tanguticum by Prof. Guoying Zhou, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Science. The voucher specimens and their information were deposited at the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Museum of Biology, Chinese Academy of Science (QHGC-1813). In each sample, we measured 11 aboveground traits, including leaf and plant height, stem thickness, leaf length and width, leaf split length and width, petiole length, number of basal leaves, number of stem leaves and number of inflorescence branches. We also recorded root parameters, including length, diameter, fresh weight, and number, and used them to calculate the underground growth of R. tanguticum grown at different altitudes and at different ages. After the plants were harvested from the fields, entire roots were washed and cut into slices, which were subsequently dried and crushed into fine powder for composition analyses.All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines. Anthraquinone standards were purchased from the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (Beijing, China). Anthraquinone mixed reference solutions for aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol and physcion were separately prepared by dissolving the accurately weighed reference standards in methanol (≥ 99.9%) to yield concentrations of 0.0084 mg/mL, 0.08 mg/mL, 0.02 mg/mL, 0.14 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL, respectively. Tannin and sennoside standards were obtained from Chengdu Desite Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). Tannin-mixed reference solutions for gallic acid and catechins were separately prepared by dissolving accurately weighed reference standards in methanol (≥ 99.9%) to yield concentrations of 0.20 mg/mL and 0.26 mg/mL, respectively. Sennoside mixed reference solutions for sennoside A and sennoside B were separately prepared by dissolving accurate volumes of reference standards in methanol (≥ 99.9%) to yield concentrations of 0.28 mg/mL and 0.20 mg/mL, respectively.To prepare the anthraquinone sample, 0.15 g was weighed and placed in a conical flask, then 25 mL of methanol (≥ 99.9%) was added, and the flask was weighed. The contents were refluxed for 1 h in a condensation reflux device at 65 °C. The mixture was cooled and weighed again, and the lost weight was made up with methanol (≥ 99.9%). Next, 5 mL of the solution was admixed with 10 mL 8% hydrochloric acid after drying at 65 °C using rotary evaporation and subjected to ultrasonication for 2 min. Then, 10 mL chloroform was added, and the sample was refluxed for 1 h. After cooling, the extract was transferred into a separating funnel, partitioned three times with chloroform (10 mL each time), and then spin-dried at 65 °C. The residue was dissolved in 10 mL methanol (≥ 99.9%) and then passed through a 0.22 μm membrane filter.Extraction of tannins and sennosides and detection were performed according to our own laboratory method. Briefly, each sample was accurately weighed (0.5 g) and subsequently extracted with 25 mL 60% methanol (≥ 99.9%) for 1 h using ultrasonication (40 °C, 240 W, 40 kHz). After cooling, the contents were reweighed, and any lost weight was made up using 60% methanol (≥ 99.9%). Finally, the solution was passed through a filter membrane (0.22 μm) and stored at 4 °C until future use.Metabolite determination was achieved via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1260, Agilent Technologies Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) on a chromatograph equipped with a quaternary VL pump (G1311C), standard autosampler (G1329B), thermostatted column compartment (G1316A) and fluorescence detector (G1315D). The column was a C18 reversed-phase column (Agilent 5HC-C18, 250 × 4.6 mm), and the methanol (≥ 99.9%) and acetonitrile used in the mobiles phases were of HPLC grade and were procured from Shandong Yuwang Industrial Co., Ltd. (Shandong, China). The HPLC separation conditions for anthraquinone analysis were as follows: 0–25 min, liquid A linear gradient ranging from 42 to 45%; 25–55 min, liquid A linear gradient ranging from 45 to 80%. The column temperature was maintained at 25 °C at an analysis wavelength of 254 nm. The program for tannins and sennosides was as follows: 0–7 min, liquid A linear gradient ranging from 5 to 9%; 7–25 min, liquid A linear gradient ranging from 9 to 15%; 26–49 min, 15% liquid A; and 49–78 min, liquid A linear gradient ranging from 15 to 21%. Mobile phases A and B were acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid, respectively. The column temperature was 25 °C, and the analysis wavelength was 280 nm.Metabolomics is a research discipline that integrates the capabilities of several types of research fields, including analytical chemistry, statistics, and biochemistry. Metabolomics assays were performed at Wuhan Maiteville Biotechnology Co., Ltd on 4- and 5-year-old R. tanguticum plants grown in the LD and GL regions. All reagents used, including acetonitrile, methanol ( ≥ ≥ 99.9%) and formic acid, were of chromatography grade. Data were acquired on an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Mass spectrometry data were processed using Analyst 1.6.3 software, and the metabolites were qualitatively and quantitatively referenced against a local metabolic database. Integration data for all chromatographic peak areas were derived and stored.Climate variables were obtained from the WorldClim database (https://www.worldclim.org), which contains data for 1971–2010 at a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds. A total of 8 climate variables were extracted using ArcGIS 10.2 for each sample plot based on their geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). These included annual average air temperature (°C), annual average highest temperature (°C), annual average lowest temperature (°C), annual average rainfall (mm), annual average relative humidity (%), average water vapor pressure, average air pressure and annual average sunshine hours. We also obtained soil samples using soil augers from three depths, namely, 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm, with 3 replicates collected at each depth. These soil samples were analyzed for total N, available phosphorus and organic matter. The total nitrogen content was determined based on the semimicro Kjeldahl method using a nitrogen analyzer, available phosphorus (AP) was determined via the Mo-Sb colorimetric method, and organic matter (OM) was determined by the potassium dichromate volumetric method. Other soil factor data were obtained from the World Soil Database (HWSD) and imported into ArcGIS software for extraction of sample data, including soil pH, organic carbon content, soil bulk density, clay content, sediment content, soil cation exchange capacity, and electrical conductivity. We also recorded geographical locations for each sampling point using a portable global positioning system (GPS) device (Beijing Huachen Beidou Information Technology Co., Ltd).All data were statistically analyzed using SPSS 26.0 software and are presented as the means ± SEM. Differences among groups were determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RDA was performed using Canoco5 software, and the results were graphed using Origin Pro 2021 software.Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.","The interannual variability in yields across the same test sites is outlined in Table 1. In summary, the yield increased with increasing age, except in Datong (DT), with the lowest yield recorded in 2-year-old plants (17.76, 10.84, 7.05, 3.64 and 0.75 t/ha). The value reached a maximum in 4- and 5-year-old plants (102.01, 78.87, 64.86, 42.84 and 41.69 t/ha), albeit with no statistically significant differences. Under the same age, R. tanguticum yield decreased with increasing altitude. Among the 5 experimental sites, Guoluo (GL) had the highest altitude and the lowest yield between 2 and 5 years, while the opposite was true for Ledu (LD).Profiles of the above-ground characteristics of R. tanguticum across different altitudes are summarized in Fig. 1. In summary, plants growing at low altitudes displayed better characteristics than their high-altitude counterparts. Notably, samples from the GL and Huzhu (HZ) experimental sites had significantly lower growth performance values than those from the LD, Minhe (MH) and DT sites. Five-year-old plants had a height of up to 229.5 cm, and their number of stem leaves and inflorescence branches also reached a maximum (Fig. 1B, K and L). Four-year-old plants displayed the highest stem diameter (44.6 mm), petiole length (60.5 cm), leaf length (75.6 cm), leaf width (79.2 cm), leaf split length (39.2 cm), leaf split width (10.3 cm) and leaf split number (5.1), although these values were not significantly different from those of 5-year-old plants (Fig. 1 C- 1I). Four-year-old plants in LD had significantly higher stem diameters than those from the other four sites, and those in GL were the lowest (12.16 mm) (Fig. 1 C). The stem diameter of 5-year-old plants from DT was significantly higher than that of LD, HZ and GL, although there was no statistically significant difference between MH and DT. Four-year-old plants had the longest petiole length (60.54 cm) at the DT experimental site (Fig. 1D). We found no significant differences in longest petiole length in LD, but the values were significantly higher than those in MH, HZ and GL. Five-year-old plants from the LD site had the maximum petiole length (47.2 cm), which was significantly higher than that of the other sites. However, we found no significant differences in petiole length between MH and DT.Profiles of underground traits, namely, root length, root diameter, root fresh weight, root dry weight, and root number of plants across different altitudinal gradients, are shown in Fig. 2. In summary, the root trait value decreased with increasing altitude for the 2-year-old sample. The LD experimental site had the highest root diameter and root fresh weight (40.14 mm and 0.44 kg), while GL had the lowest(15.12 mm and 0.02 kg) (Fig. 2B C). Plants growing in LD and DT had the highest root dry weight, while GL had the lowest. Notably, 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old samples from low-altitude areas (LD, MH, and DT) had better performance across the aforementioned 3 parameters than those from high-altitude sites (HZ, GL). Root number displayed a W-shaped trend in the altitude gradient from 3 to 5 years old, as evidenced by relatively high LD, DT and GL values and relatively low MH and HZ. In addition, 3- and 5-year-old plants at the GL site had significantly lower root lengths than those at the other experimental sites.Interannual comparisons of total anthraquinone content for R. tanguticum are shown in Table 2. In summary, the total anthraquinone contents exhibited a consistent trend across the five experimental sites and increased with increasing plant age. The total anthraquinone content of 2-year-old plants was significantly lower than that of 4- and 5-year-old plants. We also found no statistically significant differences in total anthraquinone content between 4- and 5-year-old plants across LD, DT and HZ. Moreover, the total anthraquinone content of 3-year-old roots reached the pharmacopoeia standard (2020 edition) at all sites and showed continued accumulation during later stages of plant growth. Notably, the content in 5-year-old samples was 2–3 times higher than that in the pharmacopoeia standard (2020 edition). In summary, DT had the highest contents (5.15%), followed by MH and LD, while GL had the lowest (3.52%).To further understand the effect of altitude on active ingredients, we compared total anthraquinones, total tannins and total sennoside of plants across the five experimental sites with those in one year. The results are shown in Fig. 3. In summary, the highest contents of all three metabolites were recorded at low- and middle-altitude sites. The highest total anthraquinone content was recorded in plants grown in the LD and DT sites, while the lowest was observed in the HZ and GL sites (Fig. 3A). When the altitude exceeded a certain range, the content decreased with increasing altitude. On the other hand, the highest total tannin content was recorded in HZ (2.66%) (Fig. 3B), while the highest total sennoside content was observed in DT (0.94%), which decreased with increasing altitude (Fig. 3C). The content was the lowest at the GL site (0.30%).To assess whether altitudinal gradients affect the secondary metabolites of R. tanguticum, we employed wide-target metabolomics to analyze differences in root samples of plants grown at two experimental sites (LD and GL). The UPLC‒MS/MS analysis platform and MetWare self-built database were used to detect a total of 1400 metabolites in root samples, which were mainly divided into the following categories: alkaloids (8.07%), amino acids and their derivatives (8.71%), flavonoids (18.36%), lignin and coumarins (3.36%), lipids (10.07%), nucleotides and their derivatives (4.36%), organic acids (5.57%), phenolic acids (19.07%), quinones (5.14%), tannins (1.29%), terpenoids (3.57%) and others (12.43%). We performed principal component analysis (PCA) and found that the QC samples were located in the middle of the four groups, which closely clustered together (Fig. 4). Replicates of each sample were also clustered together, indicating that the analysis had good stability and reproducibility. In the PCA, the first two principal components accounted for 61.18% (Fig. 4A). PC1 explained 36.60%, and the first principal component could distinguish samples from different locations. PC2 explained 24.58%, and the second principal component showed differences between years. Metabolites could be used to clearly distinguish between samples from different years and sites, indicating that the secondary metabolites of R. tanguticum were different under altitude conditions. We generated a Venn diagram to depict the differential distribution of these metabolites across different groups (Fig. 4B). In summary, we detected a total of 593 differentially abundant metabolites across the four groups, of which 294 and 307 were differentially expressed in 4- and 5-year-old plants, respectively, in LD and GL. A total of 158 differentially abundant metabolites between the two groups indicated that they all responded to altitude stress in the two-year experiment.Next, we used K-means clustering to cluster the differentially abundant metabolites into 9 categories (Fig. 4C). Here, 3 subclasses displayed a consistent trend in changes between the two years. With increasing altitude, Sub class 5 showed a relative content increase, while the relative contents of Sub class 4 and Sub class 8 decreased. Flavonoids, alkaloids and phenolic acids were the most abundant metabolites in Subclasses 5, 4, and 8, respectively. Notably, tannins were found in Sub class 5 but not in the other two categories.A volcano plot of 4-year-old samples showed that 140 metabolites were significantly downregulated in the upper left area, while 133 were significantly upregulated in the upper right area (Fig. 5A). In 5-year-old R. tanguticum plants, 126 and 171 differentially abundant metabolites were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively (Fig. 5B). The significantly upregulated metabolites in response to altitude stress across the two years included flavonoids, which was consistent with the results of k-means clustering. Conversely, phenolic acids and lipids were significantly downregulated.Next, we subjected the identified metabolites to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to identify enriched pathways and found enrichment across three main categories, namely, metabolism, genetic information processing and environmental information processing. The larger and redder the dot, the more important it is for the signaling pathway. Figure 6 shows that metabolite pathways differentially enriched at different altitudes in the two-year experiment contained flavonoid and flavonol biosynthesis pathways and monoterpene biosynthesis pathways. The abundance score map showed that these two pathways were distributed on the right side of the central axis, and the line segment was longer, indicating that these metabolites were upregulated. The former enriched 7–8 differentially abundant metabolites (8 in 4-year-old samples of Figs. 6A and 7 in 5-year-old samples of Fig. 6B), and the latter was 2. These results indicated that the flavonoid and flavonol biosynthetic pathways played an important role in the plant response to altitude stress.A cluster heatmap of differentially abundant metabolites in the KEGG pathway showed that luteolin, isovitexin, vitexin and myricetin were negatively and positively correlated with LD and GL roots, respectively, while luteolin-7-O-glucuronide exhibited the opposite trend. Different altitudes were associated with different contents of secondary metabolites (Fig. 7A and B). The differentially expressed metabolites between years exhibited considerable overlap, which indicated the similarity in the anti-stress mechanism of rhubarb under different altitude conditions (Fig. 7). Next, we normalized the relative content of the five common components and then generated a pathway heatmap in combination with the biosynthesis of flavonoids and flavonols (ko00944) pathway. Notably, high altitude was associated with an increase in the content of flavonoids, such as luteolin, isovitexin, vitexin and myricetin, while that of luteolin-7-O-glucuronide decreased (Fig. 7C). Five overlapping differentially abundant metabolites were considered the key metabolites in response to stress.The index of active ingredients and the growth trait index were used as response variables, while climatic, soil, and geographical factors were used as explanatory variables for redundancy analysis. The data were standardized using the ‘Center and Standardization’ method, and environmental variables were analyzed using the ‘Forward Selection’ method. The results of the six models are shown in Fig. 8. After the replacement test, the selected variables and models were significant (P < 0.05).The corrected correlation coefficient R2 of climatic factors in the redundancy analysis model of active ingredients was 0.479, and climatic factors, including annual rainfall, annual minimum temperature, annual average temperature, and average relative humidity, had the greatest impact. The annual average and minimum temperature were negatively correlated with gallic acid but positively correlated with anthraquinones and sennosides. On the other hand, the annual rainfall had an opposite effect on the level of active ingredients (Fig. 8D). The correction coefficient (R2) for the relationship between climatic factors and growth indicators was 0.615. Climatic factors, including annual sunshine hours, annual maximum temperature, annual minimum temperature, and average pressure, had the greatest impact on growth. These indicators have positive effects on most aboveground and underground growth. The results showed that warm and rainless conditions mostly favored the growth of Rheum tanguticum (Fig. 8A).The correction coefficient for the association between soil factors and the secretion of active ingredients was 0.473, and soil factors, including pH, 0–10 cm available phosphorus, and 20–30 cm available phosphorus, had the greatest effect on the content of active ingredients. Soil pH and available phosphorus between 0 and 10 cm depths were negatively correlated with gallic acid content, while available phosphorus at 20–30 cm depth was positively correlated with catechin, anthraquinone, and sennoside contents (Fig. 8E). The R2 of the growth index redundancy analysis model was 0.452, and the soil factors, including pH, 10–20 cm available phosphorus, soil bulk density, and organic carbon, significantly affected it. Soil pH and 10–20 cm available phosphorus were positively correlated with leaf traits and root traits. On the other hand, organic carbon and soil bulk density were negatively correlated with leaf traits and root traits (Fig. 8B). The results showed that an alkaline soil environment was suitable for cultivating rhubarb.The correction R2 of geographical factors in the redundancy analysis model of active ingredients was 0.452, and important geographical factors, including longitude, latitude, and altitude, affected it. Altitude was positively correlated with gallic acid content and negatively correlated with the content of other active ingredients. Latitude was strongly and negatively correlated with the gallic acid content, whereas latitude was positively correlated with other active ingredient contents (Fig. 8F). The correction R2 of the growth index redundancy analysis model was 0.456, and the important geographical factors were longitude, latitude, and altitude. Latitude was positively correlated with root diameter and fresh root weight. Moreover, longitude was positively correlated with aboveground traits. Altitude was positively correlated with root dry weight and negatively correlated with other growth traits. The latitude and longitude variations have a significant impact on plant composition and growth (Fig. 8C). Although the latitude and longitude differences (in “second”) in our experimental sites are not at a high level, there are substantial variations in soil pH, precipitation, and other factors among the sites, which may potentially influence the research results. Therefore, future studies need to pay more attention to and address the latitude and longitude differences, and conduct relevant latitude and longitude gradient research to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which latitude and longitude variations affect the medicinal herb quality.The ecological factors identified using the previous redundancy analysis model and the differentially abundant metabolites present in the two-year trials based on the KO00944 pathway were subjected to redundancy analysis (Fig. 9). Samples collected from the same site and year in the two-year trial were highly similar. Annual rainfall, altitude, and average relative humidity were strongly and positively correlated with luteolin, isovitexin, vitexin, and myricetin content. Moreover, the relative content of these four components increased with altitude. Luteolin-7-O-glucuronide is a downregulated component in the pathway, and its content is positively correlated with latitude, annual minimum temperature, pH, annual average temperature, 0–10 cm available phosphorus, and 20–30 cm available phosphorus. In addition, the relative content of luteolin-7-O-glucuronide was also downregulated. The results showed that environmental factors significantly affected the content of the five components at GL. The effect of ecological factors on flavonoids further affected quality. These compounds played an important role in the synthesis of active substances and antioxidant activity.","The gap between the growing demand for Chinese medicinal materials and the supply of medicinal resources has been one of the bottlenecks in the development of the Chinese medicine industry. Developing and planting high-quality cultivars may be the most efficient approach to solve this dilemma. However, studies investigating the ecological requirements of R. Tanguticum are scarce. Plant growth traits play a significant role in determining the yield and quality of herbs. Therefore, understanding changes in different localities and years could reveal the inherent trends in plant growth and quality. Habitat is closely related to plant size, number, and resource allocation. Previous research has shown that growth parameters, including height, leaf length, and leaf width growth, decrease with altitude. For example, the rhizome of Coptis chinensis Franch is longer at low altitudes (2300 m) than at high altitudes (2600 m, 2700 m), consistent with our findings. Root biomass decreases with an increase in altitude. Additionally, roots are morphologically very diverse. The roots in plants grown in GL were small and had many lateral roots, whereas the roots in HZ were larger, with smooth and clear differentiation between main and lateral roots. Second, the aboveground parts of R. tanguticum in low-altitude areas varied from those in high altitudes. Altitude affects the phenological period of plants. We found that later growth and development were higher at higher altitudes than at lower altitudes. This explains the missing data for plant height and stem thickness at HZ and GL in 3-year-old plants. Overall, in our research, aboveground growth was better at low altitudes than at high altitudes. Previous studies have shown that high UV rays may be a major contributor to harsh environmental factors at high altitudes. The small size of R. tanguticum leaves at higher altitudes could be attributed to high UV radiation, which may have influenced transpiration-driven water loss.The quality of Chinese medicinal materials is affected by cultivation methods and environmental conditions, resulting in different syntheses and the accumulation of secondary metabolites. Different types and contents of secondary metabolites are responsible for the varying quality of Chinese medicinal materials. Our results showed that the lowest anthraquinone content was at the GL site, and the highest content was at the LD or DT site in different years. However, the DT experimental site did not conform to this pattern, where the content decreased with increasing altitude, which could be attributed to soil fertility and the previous crop. The decomposition products negatively or positively affect the subsequent crops. For example, the total alkaloid content of Ephedra saxatilis was found to be higher than that of Ephedra gerardiana with an increase in soil moisture and temperature. Conversely, when the soil moisture was lower, both Ephedra species exhibited higher alkaloid content. Therefore, it can be concluded that high altitude combined with water deficit conditions may be more favorable for Ephedra in producing higher amounts of alkaloids. Moreover, our study revealed that the contents of sennoside components decreased with increasing altitude. The tannin content was highest at HZ across seasons, suggesting that the content was higher at high altitudes and lower at middle and low altitudes, consistent with previous studies on rhubarb. Yan et al. also showed that the contents of anthraquinone and tannins were highest at 1400–1700 m. This result was contrary to our findings, and the reason may be that the altitude range in the previous study was below our lowest altitude, which possibly limited the increase in active ingredients beyond a certain altitude. Similar findings have been reported in Gentiana cras-sicaulis Duthie ex Burk. The four ingredients followed a bell-shaped distribution within the altitudinal range of 2264–3100 m. The anthraquinone, total tannin, and total sennoside contents increased with age and peaked at 4 or 5 years old, after which no significant difference was observed between these two ages. The results of other studies showed that the best harvest period for R. tanguticum based on the content of the main functional component was over four years.Plants alter their tissue structure and chemical composition to regulate their responses to external stimuli. Our study validated the influence of environmental factors on plant growth characteristics and ingredient content via redundancy analysis (RDA). An increase in sunshine days and the average annual temperature improved the growth of R. tanguticum. Rainfall was negatively correlated with the content of effective components, consistent with a previous study. These results showed that the region with a high level of sunshine and low precipitation was conducive to the formation and accumulation of anthraquinone. Soil is the basic material for plant growth and development and for nutrient acquisition. Soil pH and 10–20 cm available P promoted leaf and root growth, while organic carbon and soil bulk density had the opposite effect. Our results show that R. tanguticum planted at low altitudes has higher quality and yield. The chemical characteristics of soil microenvironments, such as pH value and organic matter content, can influence nutrient availability and soil enzyme activity. The microbial communities in soil microenvironments play a crucial role in organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. These factors cannot be compensated for by a gridded dataset. Therefore, it is necessary for us to conduct further research in order to uncover the characteristics, regulatory mechanisms, and ecological functions of soil microenvironments in the future.Along various altitudes, environmental conditions vary significantly, which might influence plant performance and distribution. As a result of adaptive plant strategies, plants regulate their growth and development in response to abiotic stresses through primary and secondary metabolism. The metabolomics results showed that R. tanguticum contains phenolic acids, flavonoids, alkaloids, quinones, and lipids, which have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and immunomodulatory properties. Along the altitudinal gradient, differentially abundant metabolites were enriched in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and flavonols and the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway. The number of differentially abundant metabolites was higher in the former and most of which were abundant in the GL experimental site, which may have an important effect on the quality of the plants. The high content of lipids and phenolic acids in LD endowed R. tanguticum at lower altitudes with a unique quality. Metabolites were linked to climatic and other factors. Altitude, annual rainfall, and average relative humidity were higher in GL, and these environmental factors affected isovitexin, vitexin, myricetin, and luteolin production. These metabolites have antioxidant, hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and other pharmacological effects. However, annual rainfall and average relative humidity were negatively correlated with anthraquinone contents. Therefore, it can be inferred that anthraquinones dominating high-altitude areas have lower laxative qualities but higher antioxidant qualities. Consistent with our results, the flavonoid content of Agriophyllum squarrosum was strongly and positively correlated with precipitation. On the other hand, the flavonoids of Agriophyllum squarrosum were negatively correlated with temperature, suggesting that the accumulation of flavonoids may result from adaptation to environmental heterogeneity.","The present study analyzed the growth traits and active ingredients of R. tanguticum at different ages at the five altitudinal gradient sites via a widely targeted metabolomics and RDA approach. Our data indicated that above- and underground growth traits showed better properties in low-altitude sites. Additionally, extracts from R. tanguticum showed variations among sites and plant ages. Redundancy analyses revealed that the variations in R. tanguticum might be related to geographical location (latitude, longitude, and altitude) and environmental variables (climate and soil). Among them, annual precipitation, annual average temperature, and soil pH were prominent factors influencing differences in active ingredient contents and growth traits in R. tanguticum. The most critical reason for the high content of anthraquinones in low-latitude sites may be the low precipitation and slightly basic soil pH. This was also the reason why flavonoid contents were higher at high-altitude sites than at low-altitude sites (Fig. 10). Furthermore, our study results are significant for informing site selection and the systematic cultivation of R. tanguticum."

Some species can sequester CTDfrom the CTD-producing species, using it as a chemical defense against enemies.The present paper focuses on the first-ever description of canthariphilousinteractions between a checkered beetle species (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and a CTD-producing species. Field observations revealed individuals of the phytophagousbeetle Tilloidea transversalis (Charpentier, 1825) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) bitingindividuals of the blister beetle Lydus trimaculatus (Fabricius, 1775)(Coleoptera: Meloidae). Laboratory behavioral experiments followed to verify ifthis peculiar behavior of T. transversalis also occurs on other co-occurringspecies. Moreover, chemical analyses were performed to assess whether T.transversalis can sequester CTD. Our results show that T. transversalis onlyattacks CTD-producing species. However, while chemical analyses prove that T.transversalis can sequester CTD from the hemolymph of L. trimaculatus, some clues(based on a CTD-baited traps sampling) suggest that this beetle, contrarily toother canthariphilous species, does not appear to show a high attraction to puresynthetic CTD. Thus, other unknown signals, alone or in combination with CTD,could be implicated in triggering the canthariphilous behaviors of T.transversalis.","Molfini, Marco, Stefanuto, Luca, Gisondi, Silvia, Gasperi, Tecla, Di Giulio, Andrea, Mancini, Emiliano, Bologna, Marco A",2022,Journal of insect science (Online),2,False,False,True,"Many organisms use chemical compounds as a defense against potential predators and parasites. Some species do not produce these compounds themselves but can sequester secondary chemicals from other organisms. Even though most of these interspecific interactions have been observed in phytophagous insects sequestering chemicals from their host plants, a greater diversity of interaction pathways exists in nature.Cantharidin (CTD) is a secondary chemical exclusively produced by two families in Tenebrionoidea: blister beetles (Coleoptera: Meloidae) and false blister beetles (Coleoptera: Oedemeridae). This toxic terpene acts as a strong feeding deterrent against potential predators and parasites of CTD producers in all phases of their development. It is also used as a nuptial gift in some species, although such function seems negligible, at least in some Oedemeridae. Despite its renowned high toxicity, popular pharmacology of different ancient cultures has traditionally used CTD for many purposes for more than two millennia, and because of its antitumoral properties, scientific interest in CTD has been renewed in the last decades.Of note, several arthropod species, collectively named ‘canthariphilous species’, are attracted to CTD, and some of these can sequester this compound from CTD-producing beetles. More than 300 canthariphilous species have been recorded in several orders of Hexapoda (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera), and one case has been reported in Opiliones. However, most canthariphilous species have been identified just because they are attracted to either CTD-baited traps or individuals of Meloidae and Oedemeridae (e.g.,) or because CTD was detected in their body (e.g.,); thus, the ecological significance of canthariphily for most of these remains unknown.Canthariphily is well represented among species of antlike flower beetles (Coleoptera: Anthicidae) and fire-coloured beetles (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae), which represent the most phylogenetically related groups to the CTD-producing family of Meloidae. The ecological significance of canthariphily in these two families has been investigated in more detail than in others, although only on a few species. Indeed, in these families, it has been demonstrated that CTD plays a crucial role in sexual selection: males sequestering CTD are positively selected by females for mating. Males of Anthicidae and Pyrochroidae have peculiar ‘test-organs’, involved in CTD secretion, which they show to females during courtship. Moreover, during mating, males can pass CTD to females, which, in turn, can transfer the chemical to the eggs.In this paper, we focus on the first-ever description of canthariphilous interactions between a checkered beetle species (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and a CTD-producing species. Scientific literature concerning canthariphily in Cleridae is scarce, limited to only two individuals of Cymatodera sp. from Mexico and individuals of three East African species (Pallenothriocera rufimembris Pic, 1949 and other two unidentified species) collected in CTD traps. Moreover, hypothesized the presence of CTD-secreting glands in males of P. rufimembris, but the authors themselves asserted that their hypotheses needed further investigations. Besides, CTD has been detected in Trichodes apiarius (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) even though this species has never been collected in CTD traps. Trichodes apiarius is a generalist omnivore species, also feeding on blister beetles and false blister beetles, that probably evolved a tolerance to CTD as observed in other generalist predators of insects. Thus, up to date, T. apiarius is not considered a canthariphilous species.The checkered beetle Tilloidea transversalis (Charpentier, 1825) (Coleoptera: Cleridae), contrary to most checkered beetles, is a phytophagous species, feeding primarily on some genera of Apiaceae and Asteraceae. An unexpected field observation of interspecific interactions between T. transversalis and Lydus trimaculatus (Fabricius, 1775) (Coleoptera: Meloidae) triggered our research, aimed at exploring the possible existence of canthariphilous behavior in this species of Cleridae. Our observational, behavioral, and chemical data contribute to shed light on the evolution of canthariphily in Cleridae and, more generally, in canthariphilous species.","All specimens were collected in derived pastures within Quercus woodlands at the western base of the Tolfa Mountains (Italy, Lazio, Roma, Tolfa, Rio Fiume valley, 42.053816N, 11.936530E, 28 m a.s.l.).Specimens of Tilloidea transversalis (Coleoptera: Cleridae) were hand-collected while feeding on capitula of Cynara cardunculus Linnaeus, 1753 in July 2020 (N = 133 individuals for behavioral analysis). In the same area and period, beetles from six locally abundant species of different families were also collected to perform behavioral experiments on the interspecific interactions of T. transversalis: Larinus cynarae (Fabricius, 1787) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Lydus trimaculatus (Coleoptera: Meloidae), Oedemera flavipes (Fabricius, 1792) (Coleoptera: Oedemeridae), Oxythyrea funesta (Poda, 1761) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), Rhagonycha fulva (Scopoli, 1763) (Coleoptera: Cantharidae), Stictoleptura cordigera (Fussli, 1775) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). All collected specimens (N = 7 individuals for each species except for L. trimaculatus: N = 14) were kept alive at room temperature in fauna boxes (28 × 20 × 14 cm), where species were reared separately and fed with the same flowers on which they were collected. After the experiments, all the surviving specimens were returned to the sampling area.Furthermore, additional specimens of T. transversalis (N = 32 males and N = 18 females) and L. trimaculatus (N = 32) were collected on 23rd June 2021 to perform chemical analyses.After field observation, laboratory-based behavioral experiments were conducted to verify if, beyond L. trimaculatus, T. transversalis was attracted to other beetles co-occurring in the sampled area (Table 1).Experiments were staged in Petri dishes (90 × 20 mm) whose inner bottom was covered with a paper disc to provide a suitable substrate for insect locomotion. Three specimens of T. transversalis (‘recipient’) were placed on the dish. After 5 min of acclimatization, experiments started with the placement of an individual from one of the abovementioned beetle species (‘source’) on the dish. Interactions were observed for 5 min. Seven replicates were performed for each species, using new individuals each time. An additional set of seven replicates was performed to record the duration of the biting time of T. transversalis into L. trimaculatus. Potential differences in the attack rate of T. transversalis against the other species were tested using a Chi-square test.In order to assess if T. transversalis can sequester CTD from L. trimaculatus, specimens collected on 23rd June 2021 were stored in fauna boxes (39 × 28 × 28 cm) for 24 h, divided into two groups (i.e., treated group and untreated or control group), both comprising 25 individuals (N = 16 males; N = 9 females). In the treated group, T. transversalis individuals were stored together with 32 individuals of L. trimaculatus, while, in the control group, individuals of T. transversalis were isolated from any source of CTD. Fauna boxes were lined internally with paper sheets and set up with crumpled papers to increase the three-dimensionality of the arena and provide a suitable substrate for insect locomotion. A 10% sucrose solution was provided to both groups in a tube capped with cotton wool and leaned on a Petri dish inside the fauna boxes. After 24 h, treated and control individuals of T. transversalis were frozen at −80°C. Because of the tricky sex determination, individuals were sorted by sex only after the freezing phase to avoid overstressing the specimens. To explore possible differences in CTD storage throughout the body, specimens were dissected, isolating head and prothorax (HP) from the rest of the body (BR), then lyophilized for 48 h using Telstar LyoQuest −55/230 V 50 Hz. To allow a better quantification of CTD content, we pooled the specimens in a total of eight samples: TM-HP (treated males—head and prothorax; N = 16), CM-HP (control males—head and prothorax; N = 16), TM-BR (treated males—rest of the body; N = 16), CM-BR (control males—rest of the body; N = 16), TF-HP (treated females—head and prothorax; N = 9), CF-HP (control females—head and prothorax; N = 9), TF-BR (treated females—rest of the body; N = 9), CF-BR (control females—rest of the body; N = 9). Extraction and detection of CTD were performed following the protocol described in. Each sample was ground using a pestle and mixed with 50 ml of ethyl acetate (AcOEt, 99.8%; Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) in a round-bottom flasks at reflux temperature (80°C) for 48 h and subsequently filtered, after cooling down, with polytetrafluoroethylene filters (13 mm × 0.2 μm Acrodisc MS Syringe Filter; Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY) to separate the organic solution from the insoluble remains (e.g., small cuticular fragments). The solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure (BUCHI Rotavapor R II, Flawil, Switzerland, or Edwards RV3, Burgess Hill, United Kingdom) to obtain a yellowish sticky oil covering the bottom of flasks. After the extraction, the samples were injected in a gas chromatography system equipped with capillary column SLB-5 ms (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS; QP2010S, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) carrying out five replicates for each sample. The analysis program follows a temperature ramp from 50 to 260°C with a 10°C/min rate. The quantification was performed by mathematical integration of the area underneath the target peak provided by GC-MS Solution software (version 2.7; Shimadzu). Since samples were unitary, results for each sample represent the mean concentration of CTD of several individuals, but we have no data about the variability within samples, and thus our chemical results are only qualitative. Box plots were drawn on R Statistical Software (v4.1.2) using five instrumental replicates of each sample.","During a sample survey aimed at collecting canthariphilous species through CTD-baited traps, two individuals of the phytophagous species T. transversalis (; personal observation) were observed being stuck with their mandibles on the abdominal tergites of one individual of L. trimaculatus feeding on a sweet scabious [Sixalix atropurpurea (L.) Greuter and Burdet, 1985] (3 July 2020; Italy, Lazio, Roma, Tolfa, Rio Fiume, 42.058720N, 11.941320E, 44 m a.s.l.) (Fig. 1; Supp. Video 1 [online only]). Both species are common in the area but localized on their host plants, locally mainly represented by both sweet scabious and cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) for L. trimaculatus and T. transversalis, respectively. The two individuals of T. transversalis remained several minutes on L. trimaculatus, which, in the meantime, kept feeding on its host plant inflorescence. Afterwards, the two checkered beetles flew away independently.In laboratory experiments, attacks of T. transversalis were recorded only against L. trimaculatus (in six out of seven replicates) and O. flavipes (in three out of seven replicates) (the presence of CTD has previously been documented in both species:) (Table 1). Although the rate of attack is not significantly dissimilar (Chi-square statistic = 2.8; df = 1; P = 0.09), we observed a different behavior of T. transversalis on the two species. When interacting with L. trimaculatus, T. transversalis showed a peculiar behavior: it firmly attached itself to the body of the host (legs, abdomen, or elytra) through its mandibles, folded legs, and antennae under its own body and rhythmically moved the maxillae to ingest the hemolymph bleeding from the prey (Fig. 2; Supp. Video 2 [online only]). This behavior could last up to 48 min (27.81 ± 13.11 min [mean ± SD]; N = 7). At the end of the bite, the beetles left the host which, apparently, continued its activities undamaged. In three additional laboratory experiments, T. transversalis displayed this same behavior toward Mylabris variabilis (Pallas, 1781) (Coleoptera: Meloidae). Contrastingly, when T. transversalis attacked O. flavipes in captivity, the behavior mentioned above changed rapidly to ordinary predation, in which the prey was dismembered and, at least partially, ingested. Both males and females of T. transversalis exhibited predatory behaviors on O. flavipes (N = 2 males; N = 1 female) and L. trimaculatus (N = 7 males; N = 6 females).Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses showed the presence of CTD in the body of T. transversalis. Results are summarized in Fig. 3. Concentrations were qualitatively higher in all treated groups than in control groups and the highest concentrations were observed in the rest of the body of treated females (Fig. 3).","Our field observation showed a peculiar feeding behavior of the phytophagous species T. transversalis on the blister beetle L. trimaculatus (Fig. 1; Supp. Video 1 [online only]). Our laboratory experiments, performed on a representative subset of the beetle community co-occurring in the area, clearly showed that this behavior occurs only on CTD-producing species (Table 1). Moreover, chemical analyses confirmed that males and females of T. transversalis can sequester CTD from L. trimaculatus (Fig. 3). This evidence demonstrates that T. transversalis likely represents a newly ascertained canthariphilous species, revealing for the first time canthariphilous interactions between checkered beetles and CTD-producing species.Although not statistically significant in terms of occurrence, a higher number of attacks of T. transversalis was observed on L. trimaculatus than on O. flavipes, and, surprisingly, this behavior led to different outcomes depending on the attacked species. Notably, although starting similarly (i.e., the checkered beetle tried to extract hemolymph from the host), when attacking O. flavipes, the behavior of T. transversalis changed into destructive predation involving the ingestion of other tissues and leading to the death of the prey. Further investigations are needed to clarify whether T. transversalis commonly attacks species of Oedemeridae in the wild or if captivity conditions bias our observations. On the contrary, the highly specialized behavior of ingesting the hemolymph of L. trimaculatus (Fig. 2; Supp. Video 2 [online only]), together with our field observation (Fig. 1; Supp. Video 1 [online only]), demonstrated that T. transversalis actively extracts hemolymph from this species of blister beetle. Those results, together with our additional observation on M. variabilis, and a photographic record of T. transversalis biting Zonitis immaculata (Olivier, 1789) (Coleoptera: Meloidae) on their shared host plant C. cardunculus, suggest that this checkered beetle commonly attacks blister beetles in the wild. According to this evidence, and because of the absence of attacks of this phytophagous species on non-CTD-producing species, it could be inferred that T. transversalis evolved a detection mechanism allowing to locate CTD-producing species from which (at least in L. trimaculatus) sequestering CTD.Our findings contribute to knowledge on the complex and still deeply undisclosed phenomenon of canthariphily, the evolution of which remains a puzzling question for evolutionary biologists. proposed the hypothesis that the presence of canthariphilous species within phylogenetically related taxa to CTD-producing species could indicate a plesiomorphic condition of CTD production, retained in CTD-producing species (Meloidae and Oedemeridae) and lost secondarily in canthariphilous species (Anthicidae and Pyrochroidae). However, this hypothesis does not justify the presence of canthariphily in other phylogenetically distant taxa such as Cleridae. Moreover, the presence of canthariphilous species in other orders and classes of Arthropoda suggests that canthariphily evolved independently several times. Previous studies suggest that some phytophagous species, frequently trapped in CTD-baited traps, may have evolved a canthariphilous behavior due to the similarity of CTD to other plants and fungal chemicals used by species in food search. It is noteworthy that our field observation occurred in the frame of a longitudinal sampling of canthariphilous species by CTD-baited traps and, surprisingly, despite the high occurrence of T. transversalis in the area, this species seems not to be attracted to traps since only one individual was collected during all the sampling season. Thus, in this species, canthariphilous behavior and attraction to CTD-producing species may have evolved differently from other canthariphilous phytophagous species. Although further investigations are needed to ascertain the lack of attraction to pure CTD in T. transversalis, our observation seems to corroborate the hypothesis proposed in that other unknown signals, alone or in combination with CTD, are involved in the identification of CTD-producing species by some canthariphilous species. Comparing our results with those of previous studies suggests that canthariphily (and CTD tolerance) could have also evolved independently within the Cleridae family. In fact, T. transversalis is neither clearly attracted to pure CTD, as in the case of P. rufimembris, nor it is a generalist omnivore species feeding on CTD-producing species, as in the case of T. apiarius.The results of chemical analyses showed the presence of CTD in T. transversalis. The presence of CTD even in the control groups probably indicates that some of the individuals within the samples had already sequestered CTD in the wild before being collected. Although preliminary, results of the treated groups seem to suggest that CTD is stored more in some BR than HP tissues (Fig. 3). Several mating events have been observed during the experiments and the higher concentration of CTD in the females BR (both in control and treated groups), together with its low concentration in CM-BR (which have no access to CTD), could indicate that males passed BR-stored CTD to females during the copula (Fig. 3). If confirmed, this scenario would be congruent with what has already been observed in other canthariphilous and CTD-producing species, eventually suggesting a role of CTD in courtship behavior and offspring defense in T. transversalis. However, our protocol does not allow us to discern from alternative hypotheses; therefore, further chemical and behavioral investigations are needed to deeply investigate the role of CTD in the courtship behavior and offspring defense of T. transversalis. The present manuscript provides selective interspecific interaction of a phytophagous species toward CTD-producing species, proving for the first time ever the evolution of canthariphily in Cleridae through behavioral experiments in a species not strongly attracted to CTD-baited traps.",
56,TA041124,10.1038/s42003-023-05574-8,The Rauvolfia tetraphylla genome suggests multiple distinct biosynthetic routesfor yohimbane monoterpene indole alkaloids.,"Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are a structurally diverse family ofspecialized metabolites mainly produced in Gentianales to cope with environmentalchallenges. Due to their pharmacological properties, the biosynthetic modalitiesof several MIA types have been elucidated but not that of the yohimbanes. Here,we combine metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and genome sequencing ofRauvolfia tetraphylla with machine learning to discover the unexpected multipleactors of this natural product synthesis. We identify a medium chaindehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) that produces a mixture of four diastereomers ofyohimbanes including the well-known yohimbine and rauwolscine. In addition tothis multifunctional yohimbane synthase (YOS), an MDR synthesizing mainlyheteroyohimbanes and the short chain dehydrogenase vitrosamine synthase alsodisplay a yohimbane synthase side activity. Lastly, we establish that thecombination of geissoschizine synthase with at least three other MDRs alsoproduces a yohimbane mixture thus shedding light on the complex mechanismsevolved for the synthesis of these plant bioactives.","Stander, Emily Amor, Lehka, Beata, Carqueijeiro, Inês, Cuello, Clément, Hansson, Frederik G, Jansen, Hans J, Dugé De Bernonville, Thomas, Birer Williams, Caroline, Vergès, Valentin, Lezin, Enzo, Lorensen, Marcus Daniel Brandbjerg Bohn, Dang, Thu-Thuy, Oudin, Audrey, Lanoue, Arnaud, Durand, Mickael, Giglioli-Guivarc'h, Nathalie, Janfelt, Christian, Papon, Nicolas, Dirks, Ron P, O'connor, Sarah Ellen, Jensen, Michael Krogh, Besseau, Sébastien, Courdavault, Vincent",2023,Communications biology,2,False,False,True,"Specialized metabolites have evolved in plants to cope with environmental pressure and the myriad of biotic and abiotic stresses imposed by their sessile status. Within this broad group of metabolites, alkaloids are compounds with diverse physiological roles and often described as highly poisonous molecules that protect plants against pests and herbivores. The monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are one of the most structurally diverse families of alkaloids, with more than 2500 distinct molecules identified so far. MIAs are widespread within the Gentianales order including Apocynaceae, Gelsemiaceae, Loganiaceae, and Rubiaceae, and are also biosynthesized in Nyssaceae (Cornales order) and in Icacinaceae. Almost all MIAs derive from a common precursor, strictosidine, which undergoes a series of complex rearrangements leading to the formation of distinct main MIA classes, based on the skeleton configuration. These include the sarpagan, yohimbane and heteroyohimbane, aspidosperma, iboga or quinoline MIA types that are heterogeneously distributed among the MIA producing plants. While the ecological functions of most MIAs remain cryptic, recent work suggests that these compounds protect the producing plants against certain herbivores. Numerous MIAs also exhibit astonishing pharmaceutical properties encompassing the anticancer vinblastine and vincristine, the antimalarial quinine, the antihypertensive ajmalicine or the antiarrhythmic ajmaline that explain the ever-growing interest of the scientific community for the study of their biosynthesis. In addition, many MIAs also display undervalued or underexploited biological activities due to their low bioavailability in planta while other MIAs have recreational uses such as the yohimbane MIA yohimbine described as a stimulant.Over years, characterization of the MIA biosynthesis has been mainly performed through the combination of metabolomic, biochemical and transcriptomic approaches performed using the iconic MIA producing plant Catharanthus roseus and to a lesser extent in Rauvolfia sp.. Recently, the sequencing of many MIA producing plant genomes have provided complementary unprecedented insights into the understanding of their metabolism. These genomes include Rhazya stricta, Gelsemium sempervirens, Camptotheca accuminata, Ophiorrhiza pumila, Mitragyna speciosa, Neolamarckia cadamba, Vinca minor, Voacanga thouarsii and C. roseus. To date, all MIA biosynthetic steps up to the strictosidine biosynthetic intermediate have been discovered. This includes the upstream enzymes responsible for the transformation of geranyl diphosphate into secologanin, the ultimate terpenoid precursor of MIAs, but also the tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) catalyzing the decarboxylation of tryptophan into tryptamine, the indole MIA precursor. Secologanin and tryptamine are condensed by strictosidine synthase (STR) to from strictosidine, which is then deglucosylated by strictosidine β-D-glucosidase (SGD) that has been cloned in both C. roseus and R. serpentina. The deglucosylation of strictosidine leads to the formation of a highly reactive aglycone that causes protein reticulation as a part of a defense response. Notably, strictosidine aglycone also undergoes spontaneous rearrangements to form 4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine, which is then reduced by dedicated alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). These reduced products are then shuttled into various pathway branches that eventually generate the plethora of downstream MIAs, confirming the major contribution of ADHs to MIA structural diversity.Indeed, the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) geissoschizine synthase (GS) reduces 4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine into geissoschizine, which enters the biosynthetic pathway of sarpagan, aspidosperma and iboga MIAs including among others tabersonine/catharanthine in C. roseus, ajmaline in Rauvolfia sp., ibogaine in Tabernanthe iboga or strychnine in Strychnos nux vomica. The 4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine can also undergo spontaneous rearrangements to form cathenamine and 19-epi-cathenamine whose reduction through chemical treatments or co-incubation with C. roseus crude protein extracts with NAPDH yields the formation of heteroyohimbane MIAs such as ajmalicine or tetrahydroalstonine. Five MDRs that reduce cathenamine/epi-cathenamine have been then characterized in C. roseus including four tetrahydroalstonine synthases (THAS1-THAS4) and heteroyohimbine synthase (HYS), which synthesizes a mixture of ajmalicine, tetrahydroalstonine and 19-epi-ajmalicine. Interestingly, THAS1 and THAS2 also reduce the iminium precursor of vinblastine/vincristine. A short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SDR), namely vitrosamine synthase (VAS) has also been described to reduce the strictosidine aglycone into the cryptic MIA vitrosamine (VAS). In addition, members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family have been recruited for MIA biosynthesis, including redox2 that reduces akuammicine derivatives in C. roseus and can work in combination with GS to produce isositsirikine. This also includes the perakine reductase (PR) that ensures the reduction of the sarpagan MIA perakine into raucaffrinolide in R. serpentina. However, no enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of yohimbanes including the four isomers yohimbine, rauwolscine, corynanthine, and allo-yohimbine has been identified to date (Fig. 1). Interestingly, rauwolscine, also known as α-yohimbine, and yohimbine are described as specific antagonists of brain α2-adrenergic receptors that can be used, respectively, to treat levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease and as a tool to study alcohol use disorder. Allo-yohimbine displays similar pharmacological properties but corynanthine is known to be a selective α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist reducing intraocular pressure for instance. While these MIAs are synthesized in many plants, rauwolscine and yohimbine are highly accumulated in Rauvolfia sp. and notably in R. tetraphylla (“be still tree” or “devil-pepper”) making of this plant a powerful model system for the elucidation of yohimbane biosynthesis (Fig. 2a).Here, we combine transcriptomics, genome sequencing in R. tetraphylla to identify biosynthetic genes for yohimbanes using a machine learning (ML) approach. We established that many of the ADH encoding genes were clustered in the genome and displayed expression patterns similar to other previously characterized MIA biosynthetic genes. Secondly, by testing enzyme activity of the identified genes in yeast and using recombinant proteins, we identified three enzymes that produce yohimbanes both in vitro and in vivo, when assayed with SGD and strictosidine, including a highly efficient enzyme producing several yohimbane isomers. Finally, we also demonstrated that these MIAs can be also produced through a double-enzyme mechanism including a GS ortholog thus highlighting the diversity of yohimbane biosynthetic routes evolved by R. tetraphylla.","Rauvolfia tetraphylla seeds (Konstanz botanical garden, Germany) were germinated and planted in individual pots. Seedlings were allowed to grow at 28 °C under a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. DNA was extracted from young leaves of two-month-old plants using Qiagen Plant DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNAseq library was performed by Future Genomics Technologies (Leiden, The Netherlands) using Nextera Flex kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) for Illumina sequencing and ONT 1D ligation sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd, Oxford, United-Kingdom) for Nanopore sequencing. Illumina libraries were sequenced in paired-end mode (2 × 150 bp) using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 technology. ONT libraries were sequenced on Nanopore PromethION flowcell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd, Oxford, United-Kingdom) with the guppy version 3.0.3 high-accuracy basecaller.The R. tetraphylla genome assembly was performed by Future Genomics Technologies (Leiden, The Netherlands). ONT reads were first assembled using Flye assembler (v.2.5). Contig were twice corrected with ONT reads using Flye (v.2.5) and subsequently polished twice with Illumina reads using pilon (v.1.23). Redundant contigs were removed using purge_haplotigs (v.1.1.0) followed by a last round of polishing with Illumina reads using pilon.R. tetraphylla seeds (Konstanz botanical garden, Germany) were germinated and planted in individual pots. Seedlings were allowed to grow at 28 °C under a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle for 4 months or 10 weeks in case of folivory studies. Rearing of M. sexta larvae, as well as feedings were performed as described in ref. . For the experimental setup described in this study, the leaf areas around the M. sexta fed regions (+/− 5–10 mm) were collected by cutting with a scalpel. Samples were collected before M. sexta exposure (Leaf - 0 h), and then at 24 h (Bitten leaf - 24 h), including control Leaf (24 h) and 48 h (Bitten Leaf - 48 h), including control (Leaf - 48 h) after the beginning of the experiment. Samples were collected in quadruplicate.RNA was extracted from 94 different R. tetraphylla samples, obtained from 94 different tissue types and experimental conditions including: small tetrad leaves, big tetrad leaves, stems, flowers, berries, young leaves, roots, first leaf pairs, leaves and roots grown under high and low light conditions and leaves fed on by M. sexta (Supplementary Data S5). Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA was extracted using the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpinⓇ RNA plant and fungi kit (Düren, Germany) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA library construction and sequencing were performed at FGTech using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 technology. Sequencing data has been deposited under the Bioproject accession number: PRJNA771251.RNA-seq reads were processed using FastP (v0.20) with default settings. The resulting reads were then aligned to the R. tetraphylla reference genome using HiSAT2 (2.2.1) for each of the 94 individual samples. Each individual alignment was then assembled into individual transcriptomes using StringTie (v2.1.7). The resulting 94 individual transcriptomes were then merged into a non-redundant set of 56,389 representative transcripts using stringtie --merge. Functional annotation of the consensus transcriptome was achieved with the Trinotate pipeline (v3.0.1,), which integrates results from blastp and blastx searches of TransDecoder (v5.5.0,) predicted ORFs against the Uniprot database, and hmmscan (v3.1b2) against the PFAM database (https://pfam.xfam.org/).Assembly quality assessment was performed combining the stat program from BBMap tool (v.38.94), MerQury (v. 1.3) and LTR assembly index from LTR_retriever (v2.9.6). Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO v.5.2.2) with default settings using a plant-specific database of 2,326 single copy orthologs (eudicots_odb10) was used to assess assembly and gene models completeness. The agat_sp_statistics from the AGAT package (v.0.8.0) allowed us to get gene models statistics.To identify and annotate transposable elements (TE), Extensive de novo TE annotator (EDTA v.1.9.5) was used using sensitive and evaluate options.The DupPipe pipeline was used to infer whole genome duplication (WGD) events using transcript sequences of R. tetraphylla, V. thouarsii, V. minor, C. roseus, Arabidopsis thaliana, Mytragyna speciosa, Solanum lycopersicum, C. acuminata, Calitropis gigantea, G. sempervirens, and O. pumila. To identify duplicated gene pairs (40% sequence similarity over 300 bp), discontiguous MegaBLAST was used on each dataset. Open reading frame of each gene pair was inferred from the NCBI’s plant RefSeq protein database (May 21, 2021) using BLASTx (v.2.6.0-1) retaining the best hit sequence only (sequence similarity threshold: 30% over 150 amino acids). GeneWise subsequently performed DNA sequence alignment against the best hit homologous protein and its translation. MUSCLE (v.3.6) performed amino acid sequence alignment for each gene pair which further guided nucleic acid alignment using RevTrans (v.1.4). Finally, Codeml’s F3x4 model from PAML package (v.4.9) was used to calculate substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) and thus determine divergence times between gene pairs.To build gene families, protein sequences of at least 30 amino acids from R. tetraphylla were compared with eleven other species including V. thouarsii, V. minor, C. roseus, A. thaliana, M. speciosa, S. lycopersicum, C. acuminata, C. gigantea, G. sempervirens, and O. pumila. For each species, the longest representative protein was selected in each CD-HIT (v.4.7) cluster. The resulting sequences were used as input for OrthoFinder (v.2.5.4) using the following parameters: -S diamond -M msa -A muscle -T raxml-ng. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was built from 645 single-copy orthogroups. Cafe5 (v.4.2.1) was used to determine orthogroup loss and expansion across the phylogenetic tree.GO term enrichment on expanded orthogroups in R. tetraphylla was performed by comparing the relative occurrence of a GO term into the increased orthogroups gene list to its relative occurrence in the genome using a Fisher’s exact test (2-sided) with the R function topGO (v.2.44.0). Cut-off criterion was set to a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P-value of 0.05. Enriched terms graphs were performed using ggplot2 (v.3.3.5).Minimap2 (v.2.24) was used to align genomes of R. tetraphylla and C. roseus v.2.1 with the following options: -cx asm20 –cs. D-Genies was used to visualize the obtained paf file selecting hits with minimum 80% identity and sorting contigs by size.Leaves from three-months-old plants were manually cut to allow the latex to pour out. The latex was collected with a pipette tip and immediately dissolved in the protein precipitation buffer according to. Briefly, around 100 µL of leaf latex was diluted in 100 µL of SDS extraction buffer (2% SDS, 60 mM DTT, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8). Once vortexed, the samples were heated at 100° for 5 min, proteins were precipitated by adding half the volume of trichloroacetic acid/acetone 1:1 with 60 mM DTT and incubating at −20° for 1 h 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at 16000 g for 20 min at 4° and the dried pellet was washed three times with ice-cold 80% acetone supplemented with 60 mM DTT. The dried Speed-vac pellet was resuspended in 50 µL of Laemmli buffer. Proteins from the corresponding leaves were also extracted after leaf grinding in the described extraction buffer. Proteins were separated on the denaturing 10% acrylamide gel and analyzed with Colloidal Comassie Blue (CCB) under sterile conditions. 1-cm large strips were cut off the gel and sent to the PAPPSO Platform (INRAE Moulon) for in gel digestion, LC MS/MS analysis and peptide identifications.Gel pieces were washed thrice by successive separate baths of 10% acetic acid, 40% ethanol and 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and ACN. Proteins were reduced for 30 min with 10 mM dithiothreitol, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C and alkylated in the dark with 55 mM iodoacetamide, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 45 min at room temperature. The gel pieces were washed by successive separate baths of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate and ACN. Digestion was subsequently performed overnight at 37 °C with 125 ng of modified trypsin (Promega) dissolved in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The peptides were extracted successively with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 50% ACN and then with ACN. Peptide extracts were dried in a vacuum centrifuge.Peptide samples were solubilized in a buffer of 2% CH3CN, 0.1% formic acid. Liquid chromatography was performed on a NanoLC Ultra system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA, USA). Samples were loaded at 7.5 μl min−1 on a C18 precolumn (5 μm, 100 μm i.d. ×2 cm length; NanoSeparations) connected to a separating BIOSPHERE C18 column (3 μm, 75 μm i.d. ×300 mm length; NanoSeparations). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in CH3CN. Peptide separation was achieved using a linear gradient from 5 to 35% solvent B for 28 min at 300 nl min−1. Including the regeneration and the equilibration steps, a single run took 45 min. Eluted peptides were analyzed with a Q Exactive™ Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a nanoelectrospray interface. Ionization was performed with a 1.3 kV spray voltage applied to an uncoated capillary probe (10 μm i.d., New Objective). The Xcalibur interface was used to monitor data-dependent acquisition of peptide ions. This included a full MS scan covering a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 350 to 1400 with a resolution of 70,000 and an MS/MS step (normalized collision energy, 27%; resolution, 17,500). The MS/MS step was reiterated for the eight major ions detected during the full MS scan. Dynamic exclusion was set to 50 s. Only doubly and triply charged precursor ions were subjected to MS/MS fragmentation. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD046315.A database searches were performed using X!Tandem Alanine (Release 2017.2.1.4) (http://www.thegpm.org/TANDEM). Enzymatic cleavage was described to be due to trypsin digestion with one possible misscleavage. Cys carboxyamidomethylation was set as static modification whereas Met oxidation, N-ter deamidation and N-ter acetylation were set as variable modifications. Identifications were performed using a user-supplied database and an internal database of standard contaminants (trypsin, keratins, BSA). Identified proteins were filtered and grouped using X!TandemPipeline v0.2.38 (http://pappso.inrae.fr/bioinfo/i2masschroq/). Data filtering was achieved according to a peptide E value smaller than 0.01 with a minimum of 2 peptides to identify a protein.Metabolites were extracted from 94 different R. tetraphylla samples, obtained from 94 different tissue types and experimental conditions, described above in sections Biotic interaction between R. tetraphylla leaves and RNA extraction and sequencing (Supplementary Data S5). Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, then freeze-dried, ground into powder, and sonicated with methanol 0.1% of formic acid to extract metabolites. For R. tetraphylla latex, around 200 µL of latex from freshly cut leaves were diluted in 200 µL of PBS buffer and the alkaloids were extracted by adding one volume of methanol 0.1% of formic acid. After centrifugations, extracts were diluted in water Milli-Q 0.1% of formic acid and injected on a UPLC system (Acquity, Waters) coupled to a single quadrupole mass spectrometer with an 18-min linear gradient from 10 to 40% acetonitrile (containing 0.1% formic acid). Separation was performed using a Waters Acquity HSS T3 C18 column (150 mm * 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm) with a flow rate of 0.4 ml.min−1 at 55 °C, with an injection volume of 5 µL. Mass spectrometry detection was performed using an SQD mass spectrometer (SQD2, Waters), with capillary and sample cone voltages of 3000 V and 30 V respectively, and cone and desolvation gas flow rates of 60 L.h−1 and 800 L.h−1. The selected mode of ion monitoring was employed in positive mode for the following compounds: ajmalicine (m/z 353), RT = 10.4; ajmaline (m/z 327), RT = 7.4, alstonine (m/z 349), RT = 11.7; corynanthine (m/z 355), RT = 7.9; isoreserpiline (m/z 413), RT = 9.0; loganic acid (m/z 377), RT = 2.1; rauwolscine (m/z 355), RT = 6.3 ; reserpiline (m/z 413), RT = 10.1; serpentine (m/z 349), RT = 11.6; strictosidine (m/z 531), RT = 9.0; tetrahydroalstonine (m/z 353), RT = 10.6 ; tryptamine (m/z 161), RT = 3.0 ; vinorine (m/z 335), RT = 8.6; yohimbine (m/z 355), RT = 7.7.Abundance estimates were established as transcripts per million (TPM) by pseudo-aligning and counting the RNA-seq reads for each of the 94 samples to the transcriptome with Salmon (v0.14.1) with the -biasCorrect and -vbo flags. The resulting expression profiles parsed into a combined expression matrix.Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined for M. sexta exposed R. tetraphylla leaves by fitting a quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model to the expression matrix with the edgeR package (v3.28.1). For the following contrasts: 24 h vs 24 h control (Ms24h/Ctrl24h) and 48 h vs 48 h control (Ms48h/Ctrl48h), transcript wise exact tests were performed and transcripts were considered to be differentially expressed if the p-value was below 0.05, and transcripts with a log fold change above 0 were considered to be upregulated.A matrix containing both the gene and the metabolite accumulation profiles was created using the paired samples. To ensure a similar distribution of the values in samples, metabolite data were first converted into parts per million (the accumulation value divided by the sum of values for the same sample, multiplied by one million). Transcripts were retained if they had a TPM value above 10 in at least more than 6 samples. A Pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for each gene-gene, gene-metabolite and metabolite-metabolite pair in the transcriptome and ranked as highest reciprocal ranks (HRR) as previously described. Highest ranking co-expressed genes were captured for each MIA-like homolog with HRR < 30. Relationships between co-expressed genes were visualized with the igraph package in R (v1.2.6, igraph). Known MIA genes from other species were used as bait to query the global co-expression network. Co-expressed neighbors were collected to identify potentially co-expressed new MIA genes.To predict the MIA-related genes from our gene expression atlas with ANN, we referred to our recently described protocol. The input dataset was the same than the one used to construct co-expression network. The H2O library (v3.36) in R (v4.2) was used to train a feedforward neural network with backpropagation. To define the true positive events, a number of genes were labeled as MIA as described above. For the true negative events (non-MIA related genes), we used genes predicted as conserved orthologs from the BUSCO evaluation made to assess assembly completeness. Because these genes are strongly conserved across very diverse plant families, they are not expected to belong to the MIA pathway. We finally labeled 75 genes as MIA-related and 1908 as non-MIA related. This set was split into a training and a validation dataset following a 70/30 partition with seed 666. Once a network (seed 666) was trained, we looked at the number of MIA predicted genes using the full dataset (with data unseen by the network). The logloss was used as a stopping metric. A hyperparameter search revealed that a simple architecture containing 1 input layer (57 samples), 2 hidden layers (with 40 and 20 neurons, respectively) and an output layer containing 2 values (MIA vs non-MIA) provided the most relevant predictions. We added dropout ratios (0.1 in the input and 0.5 in each hidden) to improve the model generalization. The number of epochs was selected by visually inspecting the logloss progression during iterations. A value of 1500 was found to be the most appropriate to avoid overfitting. Calculations were done on a classical computer device (8 CPU, RAM 16 Gb).A personal script (accessible at 10.6084/m9.figshare.20749096.v1) was used to identify regions of physically co-localized biosynthetic genes associated with MIA-annotated genes. As input the script depends on (i) a list of blast hits vs known MIA genes, the (ii) resulting genome gtf file from stringtie --merge containing the structural definition of transcripts assembled from read alignments against the genome, and (iii) uniprot search results. In brief, the script first anchors the putative MIA orthologs blastn result and the pfam annotations onto the R. tetraphylla genomes gtf file. Next, 100,000 bp regions are scanned on either sides of the MIA annotation to search for any genes with the following pfam accessions annotated: PF03171 (2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase superfamily), PF14226 (non-haem dioxygenase in morphine synthesis N-terminal), PF00891 (O-methyltransferase domain), PF08240 (Alcohol dehydrogenase GroES-like domain), PF00067 (Cytochrome P450), PF08031 (Berberine and berberine-like), and PF00201 (UDP-glucosyl transferase). Regions with more than one gene of interest (MIA + pfam accession of interest) were recorded as a cluster of interest.Microsyntenic region with the two ADH rich clusters of R. tetraphylla (contig 414) was identified in C. roseus genome v.2.1 using BLASTN (v.2.6.0-1) with the following parameters: blastn -outfmt 6 -task blastn -perc_identity 70 -evalue 1e−10. Hits with an E-value of at least 1e−6 and alignment length of at least 1 kb were visualized using the R genoPlotR library (v0.8.11).Chemicals used in this study include strictosidine (Phytoconsult), rauwolscine (Extrasynthese), yohimbine (Sigma-aldrich), corynanthine (Biosynth), tetrahydroalstonine (Extrasynthese), ajmalicine (Fluka) and mayumbine (The BioTek).The ADH candidates were ordered from Integrated DNA technologies with a set of universal overhangs at both the 3’ and 5’ end to facilitate easy amplification with a single set of universal primers (BJL167 & BJL171; Supplementary Table S6). Each sequence was cloned into a 2 µ plasmid backbone by use of USER-cloning, with a TRP5 selection marker, and a bi-directional promoter system allowing multicopy co-expression of RseSGD and the ADH’s of interest. The resulting plasmids, pBJL66–77 and pBJL118–149 (Supplementary Table S7) were propagated in DH5a competent cells and all plasmids were verified by sanger sequencing prior to transformation. Each plasmid was transformed into MIA-CH-A2 using standard LiAc/Heatshock methods according to Gietz and Schiestl.To test the yeast strains expressing ADH candidates for production, six colonies of each strain were inoculated in 150 μL synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan (SC-Trp) and incubated overnight at 30 °C and 300 rpm in 96-well microtiter plates. After 16 h, 5 μL of each culture was transferred into 0.295 mL of SC-Trp supplemented with 0.25 mM secologanin and 1 mM tryptamine in deep well plates. The plates were then incubated for 96 h at 30 °C and 300 rpm. At the end of the culture, yeast were removed from the medium by ultrafiltration through an acroprep filter plate at 5000 g for 5 min. Supernatant was mixed with 9 volumes of methanol and 5 µl was analyzed on UPLC-MS as described above in Metabolite profiling of R. tetraphylla.Coding sequences of candidates ADH were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using their respective primers (Supplementary Table S6) and were subsequently cloned in the pRSET-A (Invitrogen) plasmid. E. coli BL21 (DE3) were then transformed using the recombinant plasmid. Transformed bacterial strains were cultivated until exponential growth (Abs=0.6) and protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG for 3 h at 30 °C. E. coli were subsequently lysed using a 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 in presence of 300 mM NaCl, 10 mg/mL lysozyme and Sigma EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, 20 u of DNaseI (Invitrogen) were added and lysate was incubated further for 10 min at room temperature. Sonication of the samples was then done on ice, with an amplitude of 40% and duty cycle of 20 s/40 s using a SONOPULS UW100 (Bandelin) for 3 min. Sonication was repeated twice. Bacterial lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g, 4 °C for 20 min and recombinant proteins were purified on Co2+ matrix following the manufacturer’s protocol (TALON metal affinity resin, TaKaRa). Eluate was desalted using PD10 columns (GE Healthcare) in a 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.5 buffer with 100 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol. They were subsequently concentrated when necessary using centricon (30 kDA cut-off, Merck Millipore). Protein concentration was measured according to. Purity of the protein was confirmed on a denaturing 10% acrylamide gel and analyzed with CCB.For in vitro assays, strictosidine aglycones used as ADH substrates were obtained by incubating 50 µM of strictosidine and 0,5 µg of recombinant SGD in 10 µL of a 80 mM citrate buffer pH 6 for 20 min at 30 °C. Afterward, 1 mM NADH, 50 mM potassium-phosphate pH 7,5 buffer and 1–3 µg of purified ADH were added in a final volume of 100 µL. Reaction was stopped with one volume of methanol after 0 or 1 h of incubation at 32 °C. To remove the proteins, samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm. The supernantent recovered and 5 µL were used for UPLC-MS analysis as described above in Metabolite profiling of R. tetraphylla. SGD control was performed by adding 20 µL of HCl 1 M prior to the first incubation.General information on how statistical analyses were conducted, including software and packages versions and number of replicates (3–7), are described in the relevant sections. Statistical analysis and graphical representation was performed in R using several packages including ggplot2 (v.3.3.5), topGO (v.2.44.0), edgeR (v3.28.1), igraph (v1.2.6) and H2O library (v3.36).RtTHAS5 (OR514622); RtTHAS4A (OR514623); RtTHAS4B (OR514624); RtTHAS3 (OR514625); RtYOS (OR514626); RtVAS (OR514627); RtAMS (OR514628); RtGS (OR514629); MSTRG.5534 (OR514630); MSTRG.5531 (OR514631); MSTRG.5530 (OR514632).Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.","After DNA extraction from young leaves and sequencing, the R. tetraphylla genome was first assembled into 1008 contigs with an N50 of 3.7 Mb. After haplotigs removal and a final pilon polishing, the 364,945,498 bp final assembly was distributed across 76 scaffolds with an N50 of 8.135 Mb and a GC content of 33.89% (Supplementary Table S1, Fig. 3a, b). The base level QV of 32.6546, corresponding to more than 99,999% base accuracy, together with the LTR assembly index of 18.90 are a very good indicators of the high quality of the assembled genome. The assembled genome reached a complete BUSCO score of 96.2% based on core Eudicotyledons genes (Fig. 2b) thus highlighting its completeness.Gene annotation was performed through RNAseq-based gene modeling and resulted in the identification of 23,228 protein coding genes, which is comparable to previously characterized Apocynaceae species. The Eudicotyledons BUSCO score of 93.9% for this gene set indicates good completeness (Fig. 2b). For almost all large scaffolds, a high gene density was observed (Fig. 3c).The combination of BLASTX against the UniProt database and hmmscan against the PFAM database led to the functional annotation of 80.3% (18,658 / 23,228 genes) of the predicted genes (Supplementary Data S1). More than half of the genes (55.6%, 12,924 / 23,228 genes) were annotated by all four databases. Putative orthologs of functionally validated MIA biosynthetic genes were identified using BLASTP against protein sequences from C. roseus, V. minor, T. iboga, G. sempervirens, and Rauvolfia sp. by considering hits with at least 90% coverage and 60% identity (Supplementary Data S2). Notably, high confidence orthologs (82–96% protein identity) for all genes of the MIA terpene precursor and the MIA biosynthetic pathway up to geissoschizine were identified. We observed that these MIA genes were heterogeneously distributed among genome scaffolds with enriched regions (Fig. 3d). In contrast, genes predicted to encode post-geissoschizine steps were of a lower identity, given the high MIA diversification across species, except orthologs for THAS notably (85–98% protein identity). Among the putative ADH genes, 79 MDR (PF00107.26, PF08240.12), 76 SDR (PF00106.25) and 27 AKR (PF00248.21) were identified in the R. tetraphylla genome (Supplementary Fig. S1) suggesting a slight increase of these families compared to other Apocynaceae (Supplementary Table S2). The majority of ADH encoding genes was distributed in all genomic scaffolds (Fig. 3e).Finally, given the major roles of transposable elements (TE) in genome evolution, genetic instability and gene expression regulation, the TE composition of the R. tetraphylla genome was also studied. Interestingly, 43.27% of the genome consists of transposable elements, mainly long-terminal repeat retrotransposons from the Copia family (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Table S3). This proportion of TE thus appears very similar to that of the closely related species C. roseus (42.87%).Whole genome duplication (WGD) events are one of the major diversification mechanisms of plants. Thus, to infer WGD events in R. tetraphylla, we identified paralogous gene pairs across eleven species including nine MIA-producing species from the Apocynaceae (C. roseus, R. tetraphylla, V. minor, V. thouarsii, C. gigantea), Gelsemiaceae (G. sempervirens), Rubiaceae (O. pumila, M. speciosa), and Nyssaceae (C. acuminata) families, as well as two non-MIA-producing species (A. thaliana, S. lycopersicum) and calculated the synonymous substitution per synonymous site (Ks) for each gene pair (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Data S3). Ks distribution clearly shows one Ks peak at around Ks = 2 corresponding to the ancient γ whole-genome triplication shared among all Eudicotyledons with no other duplication events.A genome-wide synteny analysis between R. tetraphylla and the well-known closely related species C. roseus was carried out. While it can be somewhat hidden by both genome fragmentation, the resulting dot plot clearly showed an evident collinearity between the two genomes (Fig. 2d).To gain further insight into R. tetraphylla genome evolution, we generated gene families (orthogroups) across the same eleven species 92.4% of genes (272,661 / 295,045) were assigned to 23,480 orthogroups across all species, with a mean orthogroup size of 11.6 proteins. 645 single-copy orthogroups were used to build a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4a). We investigated gene family evolution across the obtained phylogenetic tree. Overall, R. tetraphylla genome showed an increase of 2054 orthogroups and a decrease of 889 orthogroups (Fig. 4a). A total of 174 biological processes, 44 cellular component and 177 molecular function GO terms were significantly enriched in R. tetraphylla increased orthogroups (Supplementary Data S4). Interestingly, enriched biological processes included response to diverse stimuli (Fig. 4b) including abiotic stresses (light: GO:0009650, GO:0010018, GO:0070914, GO:0071493 ; drought: GO:0080148, GO:0009819 ; temperature: GO:0009408, GO:0010378), biotic stresses (insects: GO:0009625 ; fungi : GO:0050832) ; endogenous stimuli (hormones: GO:0009788, GO:0009861, GO:0071367, GO:0009753, GO:0009734, GO:0009787, GO:0080026) and external stimuli (chemicals: GO:0071291, GO:0035874, GO:0006805 ; nutrients: GO:0090549, GO:0080029 ; toxic substances: GO:0098754) ; and specialized metabolism (Fig. 4c) including secondary metabolic processes (GO:0019748), flavonoid metabolic processes (GO:0009813, GO:0009812) and most interestingly indole-containing compound metabolism processes (GO:0000162, GO:0009759). Indeed, 10 out of the 25 genes associated with tryptophan biosynthesis (anthranilate synthase-like: MSTRG.10553, MSTRG.17213, MSTRG.313 ; anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase-like: MSTRG.13694, MSTRG.17230 ; N-(5’-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase 1-like: MSTRG.10092 ; indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase-like: MSTRG.17336 ; CYP83B1-like: MSTRG.11866, MSTRG.11867, MSTRG.11869) and 3 of the 5 genes associated with indole glucosinolate biosynthesis (CYP83B1-like: MSTRG.11866, MSTRG.11867, MSTRG.11869) were present in R. tetraphylla extended orthogroups. Such evolutionary processes may account for the specialized metabolite variability found in closely related MIA-producing species, such as R. tetraphylla and C. roseus.To initiate the quest for enzymes synthesizing yohimbanes, a global atlas of gene expression levels was prepared by sampling 16 R. tetraphylla tissue types or experimental conditions for RNA extraction (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Data S5). We also took advantage of the ability of M. sexta caterpillars to feed on leaves to create libraries of biotically stressed leaf material as originally described for C. roseus. A multidimensional scaling was conducted to visualize the full samples and evaluate sample reproducibility (Supplementary Fig. S2). Replicates clustered well together (Pearson correlation = 0.91+/− 0.05 over the 16 tissue types). Root tissues were clearly separated from the other in the first dimension. The second dimension more likely distinguished young leaf tissues (seedling) from the old ones. Other tissue types such as berries, flowers and stems were not resolved in these two dimensions, showing they are characterized by specific gene expression profiles. According to these results, our dataset displays a strong variability in the gene expression levels across the different tissue types, thereby creating a powerful resource for gene co-expression studies.In addition, we performed an extensive MIA quantification on the same R. tetraphylla samples (Supplementary Data S6). Notably, this confirmed the presence of high amounts of reserpilline and isoreserpilline in young, old leaves and flowers as observed in other Rauvolfia sp. (Fig. 5b). Heteroyohimbanes were also well represented with THA and ajmalicine highly accumulated in flowers and young leaves, respectively. We noted that their oxidized derivatives, namely alstonine and serpentine were preferentially accumulated in stems and roots. Interestingly, yohimbane distribution was slightly different with rauwolscine being the most accumulated in many of the tested organs except berries and roots (Fig. 5c). Corynanthine and yohimbine were present at lower levels and preferentially in young leaves. Finally, we also observed that leaf consumption by M. sexta induces MIA metabolism (Fig. 5d, e).Based on the most probable biosynthetic scenario, we initiated the prediction of candidate genes involved in yohimbane synthesis by focusing on ADHs given their already established capacity of cyclising geissoschizine to produce corynanthe MIAs. Predicting these candidates was achieved by the combination of distinct approaches starting with a guilty-by-association strategy. The RNA-seq compendium was thus mined for gene expression levels using a classical co-expression network. A total of 558 transcripts were found in the coexpression network, including 64 with close homology to known MIA genes and 32 ADHs encoding transcripts annotated as MDR (PF00107.26; PF08240.12), SDR (PF00106.25) or AKR (PF00248.21) (Supplementary Data S7). The resulting coexpression network clearly shows some tightly connected communities (Fig. 6a). Five out of the 19 MDR encoding transcripts (MSTRG.14221.1, MSTRG.5289.1, MSTRG.5293.1, MSTRG.5294.1 and MSTRG.5528.1) had weaker similarities to known MIA genes (<90% identity), suggesting they may catalyze still unknown enzymatic reactions in the MIA pathways. Two had strong similarities with known MIA related genes (MSTRG.5284.1 98% id with VR and MSTRG.5290.1 95% id with THAS1).These first candidates were then completed by prediction based on a feedforward artificial neural network. A simple deep learning network was thus trained to classify transcripts as MIA- or non-MIA-related as described for the identification of missing steps in the tropane alkaloid metabolism. Despite the definition of true positives (best blast hits for known MIA genes), it was less obvious to select a proper set of true negatives (non-MIA-related). We used genes predicted as conserved genes using the BUSCO methods. We finally trained a model able to correctly predict 41 transcripts as MIA related (out of 75 annotated by BLAST). The Area Under Curve (AUC) on the validation datasets and cross-validation was always lower than that of the training datasets, while still retaining a good performance (Fig. 6b, c, Supplementary Table S4). Besides, the model predicted 485 transcripts (initially unlabeled) as potential MIA-related sequences because they shared similarities in their accumulation pattern (Supplementary Data S8). Inspection of the newly labeled MIA sequences revealed the presence of 28 transcripts encoding putative ADHs including 9 new candidates (MSTRG.2694.1, MSTRG.5283.1, MSTRG.5538.5, MSTRG.5530.2, MSTRG.12039.1, MSTRG.7057.1, MSTRG.9273.2, MSTRG.5533.4, MSTRG.9264.2) compared to the co-expression network analysis. Among MIA encoding transcripts, one had strong homologies with the PR transcript (MSTRG.20447.1 95% id). The other candidates had about 85% id 8HGO (MSTRG.12039.1 and MSTRG.14221.1), THAS (MSTRG.5294.1), and GS (MSTRG.5528.1).In a second step, we searched for yohimbane synthase candidates via a more targeted approach. From the metabolite profiling of R. tetraphylla tissues, we identified rauwolscine as a major MIA from the latex exuding from leaves, besides alstonine (Fig. 7a, b, Supplementary Data S6). This suggested the potential presence of ADHs displaying a rauwolscine synthase activity in latex, thus prompting us to determine its protein content. The proteomic analysis of the latex revealed a total of 575 unique proteins, 550 of which were annotated via the Swissprot database (Fig. 7d, Supplementary Data S9). In addition to the expected highly accumulated major latex proteins, we found 9 putative MDR, 10 SDR and 3 AKR within 92 proteins with GO term associated to reduction process such as GO:0055114 (oxidation-reduction process) or GO:0016491 (oxidoreductase activity). (Fig. 7d) (Supplementary Data S9). This notably includes the ortholog of the PR from R. serpentina (MSTRG.20447.1) but also two MDRs (MSTRG.5283 and MSTRG.5534) displaying homology with the THAS previously identified in C. roseus.Finally, we searched for yohimbane synthase candidates by seeking for physically co-localized metabolic genes of interest by anchoring the predicted MIA orthogs onto the R. tetraphylla genome and examining the surrounding genomic regions for identifying putative metabolic genes of interest. This analysis revealed 76 putative MIA gene clusters (Supplementary Data S10) including 37 MDR and 7 SDR (Supplementary Data S11). Two clusters containing STR and TDC (cluster 32 and cluster 55), which have been previously described in C. roseus, G. sempervirens, R. stricta, and V. thouarsii. We were also able to identify other biosynthetic gene clusters described in the closely related species C. roseus including TAT/DAT (cluster 29), 16OMT/T3R/DL7H (cluster 20), Redox1/10HGO/ADH9/GS (cluster 21) and SAT/T3O (cluster 8). Conversely, some clusters, notably the well described T16H/16OMT, could not be found. As the orthologs of these genes are not found on the same contig, it is possible that this cluster exists in R. tetraphylla but that the present genome is still too fragmented to observe this. Both recent chromosome-scale C. roseus genomes highlighted THAS and HYS clusters resulting from local duplications. Interestingly, we also found two genomic regions highly enriched in ADH encoding genes both being located on contig 414 (Fig. 8). Indeed, cluster 30 comprised two MIA gene orthologs (MSTRG.5280: stemmadenine O-acetyltransferase, MSTRG.5282: O-acetylstemmadenine oxidase), nine putatively annotated ADH genes including seven candidates identified previously (MSTRG.5283, MSTRG.5284, MSTRG.5287, MSTRG.5288, MSTRG.5289, MSTRG.5290, MSTRG.5293, MSTRG.5294) and seven putatively annotated cytochromes P450. Cluster 31 is composed of one MIA gene ortholog (MSTRG.5513: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase), 15 putative ADHs including six candidates (MSTRG.5528, MSTRG.5530, MSTRG.5531, MSTRG.5533, MSTRG.5534, MSTRG.5538) downstream from six putatively annotated UDP-glycosyltransferases. Interestingly, these two clusters show a strong synteny with a genomic region from C. roseus (contig 884 of C. roseus v.2.1; Supplementary Fig. S3) and probably is a result of an ancient tandem or proximal duplication event.To prioritize potential yohimbane synthase candidates, all predicted ADHs generated through coexpression networks (27; Fig. 6a), machine learning (20 ; Fig. 6b, c), latex proteomics (19 ; Fig. 7a–c ; Supplementary Fig. S4) and gene cluster analysis (44; Fig. 8) were combined and duplicated ADHs from different methods as well as incomplete (partial sequence, absence of ATG or stop codons) and alternative sequences were removed. On this basis, 61 MIA-related ADHs gene candidates were retained including 21 SDR, 5 AKR and 35 MDR (Supplementary Data S12). To initiate functional validation, we first focused on this last ADH subfamily given the preponderant role of MDR in MIA biosynthesis. 14 putative candidates identified from at least 2 different prediction approaches were selected (MSTRG.747; MSTRG.2694; MSTRG.5283; MSTRG.5293; MSTRG.5294; MSTRG.5534; MSTRG.5531; MSTRG.5533; MSTRG.5528; MSTRG.11794; MSTRG.14221; MSTRG.2767; MSTRG.6870; MSTRG.6894), as illustrated by the Venn diagram in Fig. 9; and amplified except MSTRG.2767; MSTRG.6894; MSTRG.6870; MSTRG.11794. Interestingly, most of the candidates retrieved from 2 or 3 prediction procedures corresponded to cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CAD)-like. Eleven other MDR candidates were also selected given their genomic location and co-expression profiles (MSTRG.17429; MSTRG.585; MSTRG.5538; MSTRG.5522; MSTRG.5287; MSTRG.5530; MSTRG.15281; MSTRG.1695; MSTRG.1633; MSTRG.21660; MSTRG.6651). Lastly, we also extended the search for yohimbane synthase activity to SDR by selecting the three candidates predicted by two distinct approaches but we only amplified MSTRG.20132.For functional analysis, each of these 22 candidates was expressed together with strictosidine-β-D-glucosidase (SGD) from R. serpentina in a yeast strain producing strictosidine MIA-CH-A2, using a high-copy 2μ plasmid. MIAs produced and secreted in the yeast medium cultures were then analyzed by UPLC-MS, monitored at the mass-to-charge ratios of yohimbane (m/z 355 - positive ionization mode) and heteroyohimbanes (m/z 353 - positive ionization mode), and compared to authentic standards (Fig. 9). For heteroyohimbanes, we noted that four candidates (MSTRG.5294, MSTRG.17429, MSTRG.747 and MSTRG.1695) produced significant amounts of a compound co-eluting with tetrahydroalstonine and having a similar fragmentation profile (daughter ions of 222, 210 and 114; Supplementary Fig. S5). Careful examination of the reaction products revealed that MSTRG.5283 also produced minute amounts of tetrahydroalstonine. In addition, we noted that MSTRG.5294, MSTRG.747 and MSTRG.1695 synthesize traces of a compound co-eluting with mayumbine (RT 10.7 min) while MSTRG.17429, MSTRG.747 also synthesized a distinct m/z 353 MIA (RT 12.3) whose identity remains unsolved but likely corresponding to a heteroyohimbane based on its fragmentation (Supplementary Fig. S5). Notably, MSTRG.2694 synthesized a dramatically different product profile consisting of a racemate of ajmalicine (RT 10.3 min) and mayumbine. Lastly, we saw that the SDR MSTRG.20132 produces a compound with m/z 353 MIA (RT 9.9 min) that we did not identify.For yohimbanes, while no biosynthesis was detected for 21 of the candidates at the expected mass of m/z 355, we saw that MSTRG.5283 displays a complex enzymatic activity by synthesizing four distinct products. Interestingly, the two main compounds (RT 6.2 min and 7.7 min) co-elute with rauwolscine and yohimbine standards and also display similar fragmentation patterns (Supplementary Fig. S6). One of the two minor products has a similar retention time and fragmentation with corynanthine (RT 7.9 min) but the lack of authentic standard did not allow us to identify the last product (RT 7.0 min). However, fragmentation analysis strongly suggests that this compound also belongs to yohimbanes (Supplementary Fig. S6) and may correspond to alloyohimbine. Overall, a 40/8.5/33.5/18 ratio was observed for rauwolscine/putative alloyohimbine/yohimbine/corynanthine. Besides its minor tetrahydroalstonine synthase activity, this result thus confirms that MSTRG.5283 encodes a bona fide yohimbane synthase (YOS) capable of synthesizing multiple yohimbanes as observed with HYS in C. roseus for heteroyohimbanes. Surprisingly, we noted that YOS is more identical to THAS1 from C. roseus than any other MDR identified in this work while THAS1 has not been reported to produce yohimbanes. In addition, based on their main biosynthetic activity and their identity with the already identify THAS from C. roseus, we also named MSTRG.5294, RtTHAS3 (where Rt denotes Rauvolfia tetraphylla); MSTRG.17429, RtTHAS4A; MSTRG.747, RtTHAS4B (A, B denotes two isoformes) and MSTRG.1695, THAS5 since no equivalent has been identified to date. Finally, we named MSTRG.2694, ajmalicine/mayumbine synthase (AMS) in agreement with its reaction products and its high identity with HYS.To provide further insights into YOS characterization, the corresponding recombinant protein was produced in E. coli and assayed in comparison with other enzymes encoded by RtTHAS3, previously characterized for its tetrahydroalstonine production, MSTRG.20132 from the SDR family and MSTRG.5538 that did not display any apparent activity in our experimental conditions (Fig. 10, Supplementary Fig. S7). Each of these four enzymes has been assayed together with SGD and strictosidine. In vitro, YOS possesses a similar activity by synthesizing the four m/z 355 MIAs at a similar ratio with rauwolscine as the most abundant product (Fig. 10a). The production of tetrahydroalstonine was also confirmed and we also noted the synthesis of mayumbine in the same proportion. While we could not explain why this last production was not observed in yeast (Fig. 9), the assay with recombinant YOS confirmed the wide yohimbane synthase activity of this enzyme. The ratio of the produced yohimbane/heteroyohimbane (79/21) argue for a main yohimbane synthase activity potentially conferring to YOS a role in the synthesis of these MIAs in planta. As a control, we confirmed that MSTRG.5538 remained inactive and was unable to convert deglycosylated strictosidine into downstream MIAs (Supplementary Fig. S7). In these experimental conditions, we also noted that RtTHAS3 synthesized tetrahydroalstonine with a minor mayumbine synthase activity (Fig. 10a). A low potential heteroyohimbane synthase activity was also monitored in the absence of the cofactor NADPH. Surprisingly, a detailed analysis of the reaction products also revealed a strictly NADPH dependent synthesis of rauwolscine, yohimbine and of the fourth unknown m/z 355 MIA already reported for YOS thus suggesting a potential low yohimbane synthase side activity. Finally, the assay with MSTRG.20132 highlighted the production of a m/z 371 MIA (Fig. 10a) sharing a similar fragmentation pattern with vitrosamine (Supplementary Fig. S8). This result agreed with the high identity of MSTRG.20132 with VAS from C. roseus, thus suggesting that the m/z 353 observed in yeast (Fig. 9) corresponds to a dehydration of vitrosamine as previously observed for VAS. While the synthesis of vitrosamine was partially NADPH dependent as reported in C. roseus, we also observed the synthesis of a low amount of yohimbine suggesting that MSTRG.20132, hereafter renamed RtVAS, also displays a low NADPH dependent yohimbane synthase side activity (15/85 yohimbine/vitrosamine ratio). All together, these results strongly suggest that different modalities of yohimbane synthesis co-exist. Indeed, while MDRs, mainly YOS and to a lower extent RtTHAS3 can perform the double reduction of the strictosidine aglycon into yohimbanes, SDRs, especially RtVAS, also share a similar side activity. Based on our experimental results and the amount of yohimbanes synthesized by each enzyme (Supplementary Fig. S7), YOS is potentially a major contributor to this synthesis in R. tetraphylla. Such a statement is reinforced by the high expression level of YOS in almost all analyzed organs (Supplementary Fig. S9).Since the synthesis of yohimbanes proceeds through a double reduction of the strictosidine aglycon, we also investigated whether this reaction is more effectively catalyzed by two distinct enzymes. The capacity of GS to reduce strictosidine aglycon, notably 4, 21 dehydrogeissoschizine, prompted us to include GS as a potential partner of a two-enzyme reaction. Given the high identity of MSTRG.5528 with GS from C. roseus (Supplementary Table S5), the corresponding recombinant enzyme was first assayed together with SGD and strictosidine to investigate its function (Fig. 10a). The formation of a m/z 353 MIA coeluting with geissoschizine strongly suggests that MSTR.5528 encodes a R. tetraphylla GS (RtGS). Similar assays were next conducted by including RtGS and the same MDRs encoded by the RtGS genomic neighbor we were able to express and purify from E. coli, namely MSTRG.5530, MSTRG.5531, MSTRG.5534, MSTRG.5538. When assayed alone with SGD and strictosidine, none of these enzymes were able to catalyze the formation of a m/z 355 MIA (Fig. 10c). However, when RtGS was added to these assays, we observed the formation of 5 compounds at m/z 355 for MSTRG.5530, MSTRG.5531 and MSTRG.5534, while no production was monitored with MSTRG.5538. Interestingly, three of these compounds co-elute with the authentic standards of rauwolscine, yohimbine and corynanthine and display similar fragmentation patterns (Supplementary Fig. S6). The fourth compound at RT 7 min probably corresponds to the compound already observed with YOS in yeast and always remained in low proportion. By contrast, the last m/z 355 (RT 9.5 min) showed variable amounts of synthesis and was the most abundant reaction product of the combination of RtGS and MSTRG.5534. While we were not able to firmly identify it, the fragmentation pattern of this compound shares the same daughter ions as yohimbane with additional fragments suggesting that it also belongs to this MIA type (Supplementary Fig. S6). In addition, we observed the presence of a similar compound in different plant extracts thus arguing for a potential physiological relevance of this biosynthetic reaction (Supplementary Fig. S10a, b). In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that a second biosynthetic route of yohimbane may occur in planta, which relies on a double reduction process successively catalyzed by RtGS and a downstream MDR including MSTRG.5530, MSTRG.5531 and MSTRG.5534. Comparing the biosynthetic efficiency of the reaction catalyzed by this association with the reaction catalyzed by YOS is not precisely achievable given the experimental differences between the two assays. However, the raw estimation of the yohimbane amounts produced by each reaction is in large favor of YOS, thus arguing again for a major role of this enzyme for the synthesis of yomhimbanes in planta. This is only different for the m/z 355 (RT 9.5 min) that was only observed with the two enzyme reactions and notably RtGS and MSTRG.5534, suggesting that this couple of enzymes synthesize this MIA in R. tetraphylla roots (Supplementary Fig. S10a, b).","To date, the study of MIA biosynthesis has been mainly conducted in a few but well-known species including C. roseus for vindoline and catharanthine, V. minor for vincamine, C. acuminata for camptothecin or R. serpentina for ajmaline. For the first three species, high quality genomes have been published and have guided the elucidation of specific steps MIA biosynthesis as elegantly conducted in C. roseus. In the present study, we have first described the sequencing of R. tetraphylla, a related R. serpentina species, well known for MIA synthesis. This genome is characterized by a very high contiguity and completeness. We annotated a total of 23,228 genes which is comparable to other published Apocynaceae genomes. Gene family identification, phylogenetic relationships and gene family contraction and expansion analysis showed an enrichment in genes associated with specialized metabolism, notably indole metabolism in R. tetraphylla. Regarding MIA synthesis, we also noted the presence of several potential MIA clusters somehow similar to what has been observed in C. roseus thus arguing for a conservation of the genomic organization of MIA biosynthetic genes. Interestingly, and similarly to previous observations in C. roseus, we noted a putative local duplication of an ADH rich cluster in R. tetraphylla (Supplementary Fig. S3). Such duplication could explain the enrichment in genes associated with indole metabolism in R. tetraphylla. These duplications could also be the source of enzyme subfunctionalization leading to the diversity and molecular variability found in closely related AIM-producing species.Given the high abundance of rauwolscine in R. tetraphylla, we engaged in the identification of the genes/enzymes involved in the synthesis of yohimbanes since this MIA type has not been documented at the biosynthetic level to date. Using this new genomic resource, the associated transcriptomic analyses and a targeted proteomic studies, we combined the study of the gene expression correlation to the prediction MIA biosynthetic genes guided by machine learning or based on their genomic localization to unravel the actor of yohimbane synthesis. Based on the mechanism of heteroyohimbane and strychnos formation, we focused on proteins from different ADH families, notably MDR and SDR that have already been associated to MIA synthesis. By combining activity testing in yeast to biochemical assays using recombinant enzymes, we first identified four enzymes displaying a high tetrahydroalstonine synthase activity (RtTHAS3, RtTHAS4A, RtTHAS4B, THAS5) and noticed that these proteins also synthesize at lower amounts mayumbine and another unknown MIA (RT 12.3) (Figs. 9, 10). Interestingly, in our experimental conditions, AMS produces a racemic mixture of ajmalicine and mayumbine in agreement with its high identity with HYS from C. roseus and the presence of these MIA in planta (Figs. 5b, 9). However, no production of tetrahydroalstonine was monitored suggesting a slightly different catalytic mechanism compared to HYS. Overall, the efficient biosynthetic activity of AMS combined to its very high expression level in leaf argue for a main role of AMS in the synthesis of ajmalicine and mayumbine in the aerial parts of the plant. By contrast, RtTHAS3, RtTHAS4A and RtTHAS4B are probably the main contributors to the synthesis of tetrahydroalstonine and its abundant derivatives including reserpilline and isoreserpilline in plant leaves, based on their expression profiles (Supplementary Fig. S9). This finding thus reinforces the role of MDR and especially CAD-like in MIA biosynthesis. However, we also showed that a non-CAD MDR (THAS5) can synthesize heteroyohimbanes suggesting that distinct evolutionary processes led to the formation of this biosynthetic activity.Secondly, using the same screening approaches, we identified YOS (MSTRG.5283) as a multi-functional yohimbane synthase. While comparison of its biosynthetic products to authentic standards confirms the synthesis of rauwolscine, yohimbine and corynanthine, MS/MS analysis also suggests that the four m/z 355 MIA correspond to the fourth isomer named allo-yohimbine (Figs. 1, 10a). Interestingly, we noted that YOS preferentially synthesizes rauwolscine and yohimbine and to a lower extent their respective stereoisomer, in addition to a very minor tetrahydroalstonine synthase activity. As such, YOS can be considered as a counterpart of HYS for yohimbanes even if closer to THAS1 at the amino-acid sequence level (Supplementary Table S5). This identification of YOS thus corresponds to the first description of the yohimbane biosynthetic modalities and its high identity with enzymes synthesizing heteroyohimbanes suggest that they have evolved from common ancestor.Surprisingly, a careful examination of the reaction products generated in vitro using recombinant enzymes revealed that RtTHAS3 (MSTRG.5294) and RtVAS (MSTRG.20132) also produce yohimbanes in our experimental conditions, besides their main and respective tetrahydroalstonine and vitrosamine synthase activity (Fig. 10a). This production is of a similar order of magnitude for both enzymes but remains low compared to YOS, (Supplementary Fig. S7). Such a result has thus multiple implications by suggesting that (i) yohimbane synthesis can be widespread in MDRs, (ii) MIA biosynthetic enzymes can be both heteroyohimbane and yohimbane synthases in agreement with a possible common ancestor and (iii) SDRs, at least RtVAS, can also synthesize yohimbane namely yohimbine. From a mechanistic point of view, it is highly likely that each of these three enzymes proceed through a similar mechanism relying on a two step-reduction of 4,21 dehydrogeissoschizine, as already suggested for GS and the formation of (16 R)-Z-isositsirikine and (16 R)-E-isositsirikine alone or in combination with redox 2. Indeed, 4,21 dehydrogeissoschizine has been proposed to be in equilibrium with a dienamine form. The formation of yohimbane would thus require the reduction of the C16-C17 leading to ring closure and followed by the iminium reduction that appears to be a common feature of MDRs (Supplementary Fig. S11). Such a scenario thus suggests a competition between GS and YOS for 4, 21 dehydrogeissoschizine (or dienamine) to direct MIA synthesis towards sarpagan or yohimbane MIA types. THAS, HYS and the related AMS reduce cathenamine, which results from the spontaneous cyclisation of 4,21 dehydrogeissoschizine. We hypothesize that YOS traps 4, 21 dehydrogeissoschizine before spontaneous cyclisation to cathenamine occurs, as also true for GS.Based on the localization of SGD, the release of strictosidine aglycone isomers including 4,21 dehydrogeissoschizine occurs in the cell nucleus. While some THAS displays class V nuclear localization sequences (NLS), neither YOS nor GS possess any observable localization sequences to efficiently target the proteins to this subcellular compartment. In this context, it is obvious that this spatial distribution favors the synthesis of tetrahydroalstonine and derivatives (reserpilline and isoreserpilline) that are highly accumulated in the aerial parts of R. tetraphylla. By contrast, in roots where ajmaline is the most abundant MIA, with low amounts of tetrahydroalstonine derivatives, huge expression of GS coupled to lower expression of THAS would guarantee access to 4,21 dehydrogeissoschizine (Supplementary Fig. S9). Similarly, differences in gene expression level and the abundance of the corresponding proteins may also provide access to 4,21 dehydrogeissoschizine/dienamine to enzymes synthesizing yohimbanes. For instance, we noted the presence of a very high amount of rauwolscine in leaf latex (Fig. 7b) that correlates with the presence of YOS. It thus suggests that YOS could be preferentially expressed in the leaf laticifers to ensure the synthesis of yohimbanes in this cell type. Interestingly, the presence of enzymes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis has been well-documented in latex for benzylisoquinoline alkaloids but never for MIAs to date.Although yohimbanes can be synthesized from strictosidine aglycone using only YOS, our in vitro assays also revealed that these MIAs can be also synthesized through a two-enzyme system involving RtGS and the proteins encoded by genome neighbors including GS close genomic neighbors (Figs. 8, 10). Although the results obtained by the different biochemical assays are difficult to compare, the amount of yohimbanes produced by two enzymes appears to be in the same order of magnitude as the ones generated by RtTHAS3 or RtVAS alone. While the catalytic mechanism could also rely on similar reductions, here catalyzed by each partner, the synthesis of an additional MIA (RT 9.5 min), which is the main reaction product of the RtGS and MSTRG.5534 couple, also suggests a higher plasticity of this biosynthesis mode and specific in planta role for the synthesis of this compound accumulated in roots (Supplementary Fig. S10a, b). Interestingly, we observed that gene encoding each of the four enzymes RtGS, MSTRG.5530, MSTRG.5531, MSTRG.5534 are always co-expressed in the different R. tetraphylla organs thus arguing in favor of the in vivo existence of this two-enzyme biosynthesis.Overall, the respective role of each enzyme (YOS, RtTHAS3 and VAS) to the global synthesis of yohimbanes in the whole plant is an open matter of debate. Based on their catalytic efficiency measure in vitro and their gene expression level (Supplementary Fig. S7, S9), YOS is likely to be a major contributor to yohimbane production, while VAS acts specifically for a high and specific synthesis of yohimbine. Conversely and despite a very high expression level, the lack of NLS in RtTHAS3 does not allow an efficient targeting of this enzyme to the nucleus and the capture of 4,21 dehydrogeissoschizine/dienamine. In doing so, it would rather limit the role of RtTHAS3 in yohimbane synthesis.From an evolutionary point of view, the multiplicity of the yohimbane synthesis modes raises questions. Of course, we cannot exclude the existence of these different modes simply results from substrate promiscuity and side activity of the enzymes tested as already observed for tabersonine 3-oxygenase and vindorosine synthesis. By contrast, the co-occurrence of single or two-enzyme mechanisms for yohimbane synthesis could also be considered as a nice example of the diversification of the biosynthetic mechanisms that the plant evolves to generate this MIA type. Such a diversification may have arisen from the local duplication of ADHs leading to the emergence of genes encoding THAS, GS but also YOS and VAS in a close genomic environment (Fig. 8). While synteny is conserved with C. roseus, we noted a higher degree of ADH multiplication for R. tetraphylla in this specific region (Supplementary Fig. S3). This local duplication seems to be a common feature of MIA evolution and has been already reported for tabersonine 16-hydroxylases in the synthesis of vindoline and several BAHD acylating MIA including tabersonine derivatives. Obviously, the future characterization of ADHs from similar genomic regions in other MIA producing plants will potentially wider MIA synthesis characterization, ultimately leading to the identification of new MIA biosynthesis actors.In conclusion, by sequencing the genome of R. tetraphylla and combining distinct MIA candidate gene prediction approaches, we identified several enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of yohimbanes. While the use of a single prediction approach may result in the identification of interesting candidates such as YOS in the latex proteome, integration of several strategies including ML based approach, co-expression analysis and gene cluster screening first reinforced the aforementioned enzyme identification but also widened discovery to unexpected biosynthetic mechanism such as yohimbane synthesis through a double enzyme process. Such a result thus adds another level of understanding to the MIA synthesis resulting from strictosidine aglycone reductions, besides the already described strychnos and heteroyohimbane MIAs. While several mechanisms of yohimbane synthesis may co-occur in planta, the high activity of YOS in yeast potentially paves the way for the synthesis of rauwolscine and other yohimbane in yeast as already described for other highly valuable MIAs and their halogenated derivatives. This is especially required to exploit the selective affinity of rauwolscine and corynanthine for α2-adrenergic and α1-adrenergic receptors, respectively.",
57,TA045385,10.3390/ijms22041714,"Cytotoxic Potential of a-Azepano- and 3-Amino-3,4-SeCo-Triterpenoids.","Semi-synthetic triterpenoids, holding an amino substituted seven-membered A-ring(azepano-ring), which could be synthesized from triterpenic oximes through aBeckmann type rearrangement followed by a reduction of lactame fragment, areconsidered to be novel promising agents exhibiting anti-microbial,alpha-glucosidase, and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. In thisstudy, in an attempt to develop new antitumor candidates, a series of A-ringazepano- and 3-amino-3,4-seco-derivatives of betulin, oleanolic, ursolic, andglycyrrhetinic acids were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against fivehuman cancer cell lines and non-malignant mouse fibroblasts by means of acolorimetric sulforhodamine assay. Azepanoallobetulinic acid amide derivative 11was the most cytotoxic compound of this series but showed little selectivitybetween the different human tumor cell lines. Flow cytometry experiments showedcompound 11 to act mainly by apoptosis (44.3%) and late apoptosis (21.4%). Thecompounds were further screened at the National Cancer Institute towards a panelof 60 cancer cell lines. It was found that compounds 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16,19, and 20 showed growth inhibitory (GI(50)) against the most sensitive celllines at submicromolar concentrations (0.20-0.94 μM), and their cytotoxicactivity (LC(50)) was also high (1-6 μM). Derivatives 3, 8, 11, 15, and 16demonstrated a certain selectivity profile at GI(50) level from 5.16 to 9.56towards K-562, CCRF-CEM, HL-60(TB), and RPMI-8226 (Leukemia), HT29 (Coloncancer), and OVCAR-4 (Ovarian cancer) cell lines. Selectivity indexes ofazepanoerythrodiol 3 at TGI level ranged from 5.93 (CNS cancer cell lines SF-539,SNB-19 and SNB-75) to 14.89 for HCT-116 (colon cancer) with SI 9.56 at GI(50)level for the leukemia cell line K-562. The present study highlighted theimportance of A-azepano-ring in the triterpenic core for the development of novelantitumor agents, and a future aim to increase the selectivity profile will thuslie in the area of modifications of azepano-triterpenic acids at their carboxylgroup.","Kazakova, Oxana, Smirnova, Irina, Tret'yakova, Elena, Csuk, René, Hoenke, Sophie, Fischer, Lucie",2021,International journal of molecular sciences,2,False,False,True,"Demographic changes such as the growth of the world population combined with an increase in life expectancy led to an increasing number of patients suffering from oncological diseases. Thus, cancer is a one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and the number of new cases of diseases caused by cancer is expected to rise by about 70% over the next two decades. Therefore, there is an urgent need of novel antitumor agents acting by novel modes of action. A promising strategy is to generate new antitumor agents from natural products. This seems particularly interesting for two reasons: On the one hand, pharmaceuticals derived from natural substances have already proven to be very effective in many cases, and on the other hand, this strategy results in sustainability in the sense of a green, ecologically oriented chemistry. Natural products remain an excellent source of drugs; for example, from 1980s to date, nearly 50% of all drugs are of natural product origin. Pentacyclic triterpenoids, which are naturally occurring secondary metabolites widespread in plants, marine invertebrates, and fungi, were recently reconsidered as model compounds for the development of innovative anticancer agents. Their activity against proteins involved in tumor development enhances the opportunity to exploit these compounds as new multi-target therapeutic agents.Over the past years, a large number of triterpenoids have been chemically modified in order to improve their bioactivity and bioavailability and to enhance their protective and/or therapeutic effects. Many studies reported triterpenoids including betulin and betulinic acid, oleanolic, ursolic, boswellic, maslinic, and glycyrrhetinic acids to exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, or antidiabetic.As far as cytotoxic properties are concerned, the presence of further functional groups seems to be necessary for pentacyclic triterpene carboxylic acid derivatives to achieve sufficiently low EC50 values. Thus, the presence of an amino substituent in ring A leads to cytotoxic but unselective compounds. Simple carboxylic acid amides are often cytotoxic in micro polar concentrations and highly selective, whereas rhodamine B conjugates can reach EC50 values in the nano-molar concentration range but hold the risk of being highly cytotoxic for all types of cells.Among these derivatives, triterpenoids, which could be synthesized from triterpenic oximes through a Beckmann type rearrangement followed by a subsequent reduction reaction holding an A-azepane ring or a 3-amino-3,4-seco-4(24)-en-fragment are a group of new and promising modifications exhibiting anti-microbial, anticancer, alpha-glucosidase as well as butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities.","In short, exponentially growing cells were seeded into 96-well plates on day 0 at the appropriate cell densities to prevent confluence of the cells during the period of experiment. After 24 h, the cells were treated with serial dilutions of the compounds (0–30 µM) for 72 h. The final concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0.5%, which was non-toxic to the cells. After a 72 h treatment, the supernatant medium from the 96-well plates was discarded, and the cells were fixed with 10% TCA. For a thorough fixation, the plates were allowed to rest at 4 °C. After fixation, the cells were washed in a strip washer. The washing was done four times with water using alternate dispensing and aspiration procedures. The plates were then dyed with 100 µL of 0.4% SRB for about 20 min. After dying, the plates were washed with 1% acetic acid to remove the excess of the dye and allowed to air-dry overnight. Tris base solution (200 µL, 10 mM) was added to each well and absorbance was measured at λ = 570 nm (using a 96 well plate reader, Tecan Spectra, Crailsheim, Germany). The percentages of surviving cells relative to untreated controls were determined. The EC50 values were averaged from three independent experiments performed each in triplicate calculated from semi logarithmic dose response curves applying a non-linear 4P Hills-slope equation (GraphPad Prism5; the variables top and bottom were set to 100 and 0, respectively). Approximately 600,000 cells (A375) were seeded in cell culture flasks and were allowed to grow for 1 day. After removing of the medium, the substance loaded medium was added, and the flasks were incubated for 48 h. All cells were harvested, centrifuged (1200 rpm, 5 min), and washed twice (PBS (w/w)). Approximately 100,000 cells were washed with annexin V bounding buffer (BD Biosciences®) and treated with a propidium iodide solution (3 μL, 1 mg/mL) and annexin V (5 μL, BD Biosciences®) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After adding annexin V bounding buffer (400 μL) the suspension was submitted to a FACS measurement. Calculation was performed as suggested from the supplier (BD Biosciences®).The screening is a two-stage process, beginning with the evaluation of all compounds against the 60 cell lines at a single dose of 10−5 M. Compounds that exhibit significant growth inhibition are evaluated against the 60-cell panel at five concentration levels. The human tumor cell lines of the cancer-screening panel are grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. For a typical screening experiment, cells are inoculated into 96-well micro titer plates in 100 mL at plating densities ranging from 5000 to 40,000 cells/well depending on the doubling time of individual cell lines. After cell inoculation, the micro titer plates are incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO, 95% air, and 100% relative humidity for 24 h prior to addition of experimental drugs. After 24 h, two plates of each cell line are fixed in situ with TCA, to represent a measurement of the cell population for each cell line at the time of drug addition (Tz). Experimental drugs are solubilized in dimethylsulfoxide at 400-fold the desired final maximum test concentration and stored frozen prior to use. At the time of drug addition, an aliquot of frozen concentrate is dissolved and diluted to twice the desired final maximum test concentration with complete medium containing 50 mg/mL gentamicin. Additional four, 10-fold, or ½ log serial dilutions are made to provide a total of five drug concentrations plus control. Aliquots of 100 mL of these different drug dilutions are added to the appropriate micro titer wells already containing 100 mL of medium, resulting in the required final drug concentrations. Following drug addition, the plates are incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air, and 100% relative humidity. For adherent cells, the assay is terminated by the addition of cold TCA. Cells are fixed in situ by the gentle addition of 50 mL of cold 50% TCA (final concentration, 10% TCA) and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant is discarded, and the plates are washed five times with tap water and air dried. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) solution (100 mL) at 0.4% in 1% acetic acid is added to each well, and plates are incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After staining, unbound dye is removed by washing five times with 1% acetic acid and the plates are air dried. Bound stain is subsequently solubilized with 10 mM Trizma base, and the absorbance is read on an automated plate reader at a wavelength of 515 nM. For suspension cells, the methodology is the same except that the assay is terminated by fixing settled cells at the bottom of the wells by gently adding 50 mL of 80% TCA (final concentration, 16% TCA). Using the seven absorbance measurements [time zero (Tz), control growth (C), and test growth in the presence of drug at the five concentration levels (Ti)], the percentage growth is calculated at each of the drug concentrations levels. Percentage growth inhibition is calculated as:[(Ti_Tz)/(C_Tz)]_100 for concentrations for which Ti_Tz[(Ti_Tz)/Tz]_100 for concentrations for which Ti < TzThree dose response parameters are calculated for each experimental agent. Growth inhibition of 50% (GI50) is calculated from [(Ti_Tz)/(C_Tz)]_100 ¼ 50, which is the drug concentration resulting in a 50% reduction in the net protein increase (as measured by SRB staining) in control cells during the drug incubation. The drug concentration resulting in total growth inhibition (TGI) is calculated from (Ti ¼ Tz). The LC50 (concentration of drug resulting in a 50% reduction in the measured protein at the end of the drug treatment as compared to that at the beginning) indicating a net loss of cells following treatment is calculated from[(Ti_Tz)/Tz]_100¼_50Values are calculated for each of these three parameters if the level of activity is reached; however, if the effect is not reached or is exceeded, the value for that parameter is expressed as greater or less than the maximum or minimum concentration tested.","In this study, a total of 20 A-ring azepano- 1–17 and 3-amino-3,4-seco- 18–20 triterpenoids were synthesized from betulin, oleanolic, ursolic, and glycyrrhetinic acids according to methods described earlier. Their structures are presented at Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4.The cytotoxicity of compounds 1–20 was evaluated by means of a colorimetric sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. For all compounds, the EC50 values were determined for the human tumor cell lines A375 (malignant melanoma), HT29 (colorectal carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), A2780 (ovarian carcinoma), FaDu (hypopharyngeal carcinoma), and NIH 3T3 (non-malignant mouse fibroblasts). The results are compiled in the Table 1.The results from the SRB assays showed all compounds of good cytotoxicity with EC50 values ranging between 0.88 µM (compound 11 for FaDu cells) and 7.92 µM (compound 2 for A375 cells). Compound 11 was the most cytotoxic of this series, but this compound showed little selectivity between the different human tumor cell lines as well as to non-malignant fibroblasts. Compound 6, however, was most cytotoxic for A2780 ovarian cancer cells (EC50 = 3.93 µM) but significantly less cytotoxic for non-malignant fibroblasts (NIH 3T3, 11.68 µM) thus resulting in a selectivity factor S (EC50 (NIH 3T3)/EC50 (A2780) of approximately 3 (Table 2). Due to its good cytotoxic properties, compound 11 was subjected to flow cytometric measurements (Annexin V/PI assay). Thereby, A375 cells were treated with 2 × EC50 concentrations of 11 for 48 h, and the results from these experiments are depicted in Figure 5.Thereby, the BL1-A signal corresponds to the FITC signal for annexin V (x-axis) while PI is detected at BL3-A (y-axis). Thus, cells in R1 correspond to necrotic cells, those in R2 to late apoptosis, cells in R3 are viable cells, and cells in R4 have died from apoptosis. Thus, from the 48 h incubation of 11, 44.3% of the A375 cells have died by apoptosis and 21.4% by late apoptosis. The number of necrotic cells remained small (1.1%).Taking into account the results of cytotoxicity of triterpenoids 1–20 against the five human cancer cell lines and non-malignant mouse fibroblasts, they were subjected to the NCI-60 Anticancer Drug Screening. Compounds 1–9, 11–17, 19, and 20 were selected by National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, Rockville, MD, USA) Developmental Therapeutic Program (DTP) and tested at one dose assay (10−5 M) towards a panel of approximately 60 cancer cell lines representing different cancer types: Leukemia, melanoma, lung, colon, CNS, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast cancers. Primary anticancer assays were performed according to the NCI protocol as described elsewhere (see e.g.,  (accessed on 16 October 2019)). The compounds were added at a single concentration and the cell cultures were incubated for 48 h. The end point determinations were made with a protein binding dye, sulforhodamine B (SRB). The results for each compound are reported as the percent growth (GP %) of treated cells compared to untreated control cells (negative numbers indicate cell kill). The range of percent growth shows the lowest and the highest percent growth found among the different cancer cell lines (Table 3 and Figures S1–S18 Supporting Material).The anticancer activity results showed that the cytotoxic effect of the studied azepano derivatives was directly dependent on the type of triterpenic core. So, the azepanomessagenin 2 did not show antiproliferative activity, while the azepanobetulin 1 and azepanoerythrodiol 3 were effective for 28 and 30 cancer cell lines. The anticancer activity of the azepano-glycyrretols was strongly influenced by the presence of an additional double bond in the triterpene core—thus, azepano-glycyrretol 5 was active only towards 8 human tumor cell lines, while diene 6 demonstrated a pronounced antiproliferative effect against the whole NCI-60 cancer cell line panel. Azepanouvaol 4 was also highly active against 57 cell lines. The transformation of azepanobetulin 1 into azepanoallobetulin 7 led to a significant increase in activity against 52 cancer cell lines, whereas the anticancer effect of abeo-lupanes 8 and 9 influenced by the position of the double bond. Thus, abeo-lupane 8 effectively acted against 55 cell lines, while its regio-isomer 9 was active only towards 36 lines. Modification at the C28 position of azepanobetulin derivatives increased the activity of the initial compounds—the introduction of a tosyl fragment (compound 12) led to activity against 39 cancer cell lines, and the amide fragment (compound 11) was effective against the all NCI-60 cancer cell line panel. At the same time, the introduction of amide fragments into the C28 position of the azepanotriterpenic alcohols 4 and 5 led to a general decrease of anticancer effect-amide 13 was active only towards 6 tumor cell lines, and amide 14-against 45 cell lines. Replacement of the hydroxyl group to tosyl as in compounds 15 and 16 also led to a decrease in antiproliferative activity-these compounds inhibited 22 and 40 cell lines, respectively. Oxidation of the double bond to a 12-oxo group (compound 17) led to a complete loss of cytotoxic activity, whereas 3-amino-3,4-seco-4(23)-en triterpenic derivatives of uvaol 19 and glycyrrhetol 20 showed an activity against 45 and 52 cancer cell lines, respectively.Finally, 15 A-azepano- 1, 3, 4, 6, 7–9, 11, 12, 14–16, and 3-amino-3,4-seco-triterpenoids 19, 20 were selected in an advanced assay against a panel of approximately sixty tumor cell lines at 10-fold dilutions of five concentrations (100 µM, 10 µM, 1 µM, 0.1 µM, and 0.01 µM). The percentage of growth was evaluated spectrophotometrically versus controls not treated with the test agents after 48-h exposure and using SRB protein assay to estimate cell viability or growth. Three antitumor activity dose-response parameters were calculated for each cell line: GI50—molar concentration of the compound that inhibits 50% net cell growth; TGI—molar concentration of the compound leading to the total inhibition; and LC50—molar concentration of the compound leading to 50% net cell death (presented in negative logarithm). Furthermore, mean graph midpoints (MG_MID) were calculated for each of the parameters, giving an average activity parameter over all cell lines for the tested compound. For the MG_MID calculation, insensitive cell lines were included with the highest concentration tested (see the Supporting Material Figures S19–S32 and Tables S1–S3).Thus, all compounds exhibited significant antiproliferative effect towards human cancer cell lines, and among them, the highest cytotoxic activity in five-dose testing mode screening was observed for compounds 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 19, and 20 with growth inhibitory (GI50) against the most sensitive cell lines at submicromolar concentrations (0.20–0.94 μM). Cytotoxic activity (LC50) of these compounds against the most sensitive cancer cell lines was also high (1–6 μM). The compounds 3 and 19 showed a broad spectrum of growth inhibition activity (GI50 < 10 μM) against all human tumor cells with average GI50/TGI/LC50 values of 3.83/15.49/39.56 µM (3), and 1.42/3.89/16.97 µM (20), respectively. Compounds 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 20 inhibited the growth of all tested cancer cell lines and showed inhibition activity (GI50 < 3 μM) against all human tumor cell lines with average GI50/TGI/LC50 values of 1.70/3.34/17.48 μM (1), 1.65/3.31/7.64 µM (4), 1.68/3.64/17.17 µM (7), 1.73/3.53/16.89 µM (8), 1.75/3.35/6.43 µM (9), 1.29/2.64/5.62 µM (11), 1.77/3.43/5.84 µM (12), 1.72/3.35/6.52 µM (14), 1.72/3.52/19.43 µM (16), and 1.66/3.36/17.30 µM (20), respectively. Compounds 6 and 15 demonstrated growth inhibition activity (GI50 < 15 μM) towards all cancer cell lines with average GI50/TGI/LC50 values of 4.21/13.17/41.94 µM (6) and 1.99/3.80/29.02 µM (15) (Tables S1–S3 Supporting Material). Mean GI50 values for these compounds in comparison with standard anticancer agent’s doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil are given at Table S3 Supporting Material.The selectivity index (SI) was calculated by dividing the full panel MG_MID60 (μM) of the compounds 1, 3, 4, 6–9, 11, 12, 14–16, 19, and 20 by their individual subpanel MG_MID of the cell line (μM) and is to be considered as a measure of the compounds’ selectivity (Table 4). Ratios between 3 and 6 mean moderate selectivity, ratios greater than 6 indicate high selectivity towards the corresponding cell line, while compounds not meeting either of these criteria are rated nonselective. In this context, the compounds 4, 6–9, 12, 14, and 20 in the present study were found to be nonselective at all the GI50, TGI, and LC50 levels (selectivity indexes 0.57–1.59, 0.66–1.52 and 0.17–2.95, respectively). Based on the selectivity ratio, compound 11 in the study was found to be moderate selective for a growth inhibition regarding the leukemia subpanel with a selectivity ratio at GI50 level of 3.79, otherwise, it was found lower selective against other cell panels. Compound 3 was moderately selective at the TGI and LC50 levels towards colon, CNS, prostate cancer, and melanoma (selectivity indexes 3.59–4.69 and 3.18–4.63, respectively), as well as compounds 1, 15, 16, and 19 at the LC50 level (selectivity indexes 3.09–4.81). Furthermore, derivatives 3, 8, 11, 15, and 16 demonstrated a certain selectivity profile towards some individual cell lines at GI50 and TGI levels. GI50 level was from 5.16 to 6.45 for HL (60)-TB, K-562, CCRF-CEM, RPMI-8226 (leukemia), HT29 (colon cancer), and OVCAR-4 (ovarian cancer). At the same time, TGI level of moderate selectivity was observed for compound 11 towards leukemia cell line HL(60)-TB (SI = 5.74). Selectivity indexes of compound 3 at TGI level was 5.93–14.89 for HCT-116 (colon cancer), SF-539, SNB-19, and SNB-75 (CNS cancer). However, for compound 3 high selectivity at GI50 level was observed only for leukemia cell line K-562 (SI = 9.56) (Table 5).A raw comparison of the activities of studied compounds with respect to the activity reported for the standard drugs doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil, used by NCI as control reflects that the activity displayed for these compounds was lower than for doxorubicin except for colon cancer HCT-15 and ovarian cancer NCI/ADR-RES (compound 11). Comparison of the compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 7–9, 11, 12, 14–16, 19, and 20 activities with 5-fluorouracil showed that the studied compounds were more active against cell lines of leukemia CCRF-CEM, HL(60)-TB (exception compound 4), K-562; NSCL cancer HOP-92, NCI-H226, and NCI-H522; CNS cancer SNB-75 (exception compounds 3 and 6); melanoma SK-MEL-2 and UACC-257; ovarian cancer OVCAR-4 (exception 3 and 6), OVCAR-5, and SK-OV-3; renal cancer RXF 393 (exception 3); prostate cancer PC-3 (exception 1); breast cancer MDA-MB-31/ATCC, HS 578T, BT-549, and T-47D. Furthermore, compound 11 also showed the best inhibition of colon cancer SW-620, CNS cancer SF-268, melanoma M14, ovarian cancer OVCAR-8, renal cancer 786-0 cell lines; compound 15—renal cancer TK-10; compound 19—CNS cancer SF-268, melanoma M14, SK-MEL-28, ovarian cancer IGROV1, OVCAR-8, renal cancer TK-10; compound 20—CNS cancer SF-268 and renal cancer TK-10 (Table S1 Supporting Material). ",,"In summary, a series of A-ring azepano- and 3,4-seco-derivatives of betulin, oleanolic, ursolic, and glycyrrhetinic acids were evaluated as cytotoxic agents. Azepanoallobetulinic acid amide derivative 11 was the most cytotoxic compound of this series but showed little selectivity between the different human tumor cell lines, while azepano-glycyrrhetol-diene 6 was most cytotoxic for A2780 ovarian cancer cells (EC50 = 3.93 µM) but significantly less cytotoxic for non-malignant fibroblasts (NIH 3T3, 11.68 µM) thus resulting in a selectivity factor S (EC50 (NIH 3T3)/EC50 (A2780) of approximately 3. Flow cytometry experiments showed compound 11 to act mainly by apoptosis (44.3%) and late apoptosis (21.4%). The further screening toward the NCI-60 cancer cell panel showed submicromolar level of GI50 for compounds 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 19, and 20 (range from 0.20 to 0.94 μM) against the most sensitive cell lines, while LC50 was also high (1–6 μM). Derivatives 3, 8, 11, 15, and 16 demonstrated a certain selectivity profile from 5.16 to 9.56 toward individual cell lines of Leukemia, Colon cancer and Ovarian cancer. Selectivity of a leader compound azepanoerythrodiol 3 at TGI level ranged from 5.93 for SF-539, SNB-19, and SNB-75 (CNS cancer) to 14.89 for HCT-116 (colon cancer). Thus, A-ring-azepano triterpenoids are interesting starting structures for the synthesis of biologically active molecules, especially of cytotoxic agents."
58,TA022833,10.3390/ijms20184334,RNA-Seq de Novo Assembly and Differential Transcriptome Analysis of Chaga(Inonotus obliquus) Cultured with Different Betulin Sources and the Regulation ofGenes Involved in Terpenoid Biosynthesis.,"Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) is a medicinal fungus used in traditional medicine ofNative American and North Eurasian cultures. Several studies have demonstratedthe medicinal properties of chaga's bioactive molecules. For example, severalterpenoids (e.g., betulin, betulinic acid and inotodiol) isolated from I.obliquus cells have proven effectiveness in treating different types of tumorcells. However, the molecular mechanisms and regulation underlying thebiosynthesis of chaga terpenoids remain unknown. In this study, we report on theoptimization of growing conditions for cultured I. obliquus in presence ofdifferent betulin sources (e.g., betulin or white birch bark). It was found thatbetter results were obtained for a liquid culture pH 6.2 at 28 °C. In addition, ade novo assembly and characterization of I. obliquus transcriptome in thesegrowth conditions using Illumina technology was performed. A total of 219,288,500clean reads were generated, allowing for the identification of 20,072 transcriptsof I. obliquus including transcripts involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Thedifferential expression of these genes was confirmed by quantitative-PCR. Thisstudy provides new insights on the molecular mechanisms and regulation of I.obliquus terpenoid production. It also contributes useful molecular resources forgene prediction or the development of biotechnologies for the alternativeproduction of terpenoids.","Fradj, Narimene, Gonçalves Dos Santos, Karen Cristine, de Montigny, Nicolas, Awwad, Fatima, Boumghar, Yacine, Germain, Hugo, Desgagné-Penix, Isabel",2019,International journal of molecular sciences,2,True,False,True,"[""**1. introduction** *Inonotus obliquus*, a member of the Hymenochaetaceae family of Basidiomycetes, is a medicinal fungus used in the traditional medicine of Native American and North Eurasian cultures. *I. obliquus*, commonly known as chaga or black diamond, is used by some Canadian First Nations to treat infections and tumors. Chaga is a black parasitic fungus that grows on the living trunks of the northern latitudes of America, Europe and Asia, and it is the primary pathogen of birch and other Betulaceae trees [\\[1\\]](#page-22-0). In nature, instead of a fruiting body, it usually forms an irregular shape of a sclerotial conk with the appearance of burnt charcoal, and it has been used for centuries as a folk medicine to treat and prevent multiple diseases. Over the last decade, studies have revealed that the extract of *I. obliquus* contains biologically active molecules derived from the specialized metabolism, supporting the effectiveness of chaga in traditional medicine. These specialized metabolites (e.g., polysaccharides, polyphenols and terpenoids) are responsible for *I. obliquus*'s medicinal effects including those of the antioxidant [\\[1](#page-22-0)[–11\\]](#page-22-1), antibacterial [\\[1](#page-22-0)[,7](#page-22-2)[,12](#page-22-3)[,13\\]](#page-22-4), anti-diabetic [\\[14](#page-22-5)[–19\\]](#page-22-6), and anticancer [\\[16,](#page-22-7)[19](#page-22-6)[–37\\]](#page-23-0) types. Terpenoids consist of a large and diverse class of chemicals among the multitude of metabolites produced by fungi. Fungi employ terpenoids for an array of primary functions (growth and development) and for specialized activities, chemical interactions, and protection against abiotic and biotic factors. *I. obliquus* produces a diverse range of bioactive terpenoids exhibiting compelling therapeutic activity (e.g., anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory). Among the bioactive terpenoids found in chaga, sesquiterpenoids (e.g., bergamotene, selinene, and santalene) and triterpenoids (e.g., betulin, betulinic acid, lanosterol, inotodiol, and trametenolic acid) have been identified [\\[1,](#page-22-0)[35,](#page-23-1)[38–](#page-23-2)[43\\]](#page-24-0). In addition, *I. obliquus* is able to catabolize metabolites from its birch host to grow and develop. White birch bark contains large amount of triterpenoids including betulin and betulinic acid, which represent up to 75% and 2% of the extractives, respectively [\\[44](#page-24-1)[,45\\]](#page-24-2). It is not clear if betulin and betulinic acid detected in *I. obliquus* sclerotia result only from fungal de novo synthesis, from the transformation of birch terpenoid metabolites, or from both. It has been shown that *I. obliquus* cells are able to produce these triterpenoids in a submerged culture, suggesting the presence of genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes involved in their de novo production [\\[46\\]](#page-24-3). However, the identification and regulation of these genes remain unknown. In fungi, terpenoid biosynthesis occurs via the mevalonate (MVA) metabolic pathway which can be divided into three parts (Appendix [A—](#page-17-0)Figure [A1\\)](#page-18-0). The first part (precursor pathway) involves a series of enzymatic reactions converting acetyl-CoA to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are the precursors of all terpenoids. For the second part (the sesquiterpenoid pathway), the cytosolic farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) condenses two molecules of IPP with one molecule DMAPP head-to-tail sequentially to produce farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). FFP serves as a precursor for sesquiterpenoids, which are synthesized by terpene synthases and can be processed by other assorted enzymes. Lastly, the third part of the pathway involves reactions that catalyze the formation of three groups of triterpenoids: The amyrin-type, the lanosterol-type and the lupeol-type. In recent years, high throughput sequencing platforms such as the Illumina RNA-Seq have been developed to study the transcriptome of model and non-model species, including plants, animals and microorganisms. This advanced sequencing technology has proven to be a cost-effective, rapid and powerful tool for investigating new functional genes and for detecting differentially expressed genes in diverse species. Currently, there is no genome information available for the Inonotus species; hence, the molecular basis of terpenoid production has not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to use de novo transcriptomic to generate a comprehensive profile of the genes related to terpenoid production in an *I. obliquus* cell culture supplemented or not with terpenoid substrates. Moreover, a better understanding of the metabolic pathway for the synthesis of *I. obliquus* pharmaceutically-relevant metabolites such as betulinic acid, betulin and inotodiol will enable tools to increase the production of these valued metabolites. Chaga's host, i.e., white birch (*Betula papyrifera*), also produces betulin in high concentrations [\\[47](#page-24-4)[,48\\]](#page-24-5). It has been reported that the use of microorganisms isolated from the same sources as the host substrate would increase the probability of obtaining derivatives of this substrate using the bioconversion approach [\\[49\\]](#page-24-6). Related to that, the co-culture of chaga with white birch bark residues could increase the conversion of betulin trapped in birch bark into betulinic acid to valorize forestry residues on one side, and, on the other side, it could elucidate the relationships between chaga and white birch bark. In this study, the optimal growth conditions of *I. obliquus* cultured with or without betulin or white birch bark were investigated, and RNA was isolated. A cDNA library was then generated, and a whole transcriptomic analysis was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 4000. Whole-transcriptome was assembled de novo and analyzed, and differential expression studies confirmed by qRT-PCR unveiled the genes responsible for the terpenoid pathways in chaga.

Standard betulin (98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Louis, MO, USA). Methanol, acetonitrile and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), ethyl acetate, and acetic acid were HPLC grade from Fisher Chemical. The other cited chemicals were of analytical grade. Media components (yeast extract, malt extract, agar, etc.) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Louis, MO, USA). ', '*3.2. fungal culture and growth conditions* *I. obliquus* was provided and cultured by the Biopterre laboratory (La Pocatière, Qc, Canada). The stock of *I. obliquus* was maintained on a potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium, and the stock culture was stored at 4 ◦C. The identity of the isolate was confirmed by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA region. The sequence data were deposited to the NCBI database under the GenBank accession number MN239482. To optimize the mycelial growth of *I. obliquus* in laboratory, yeast malt broth (YMB) and yeast malt agar (YMA) media were selected based on previous reported studies [\\[51,](#page-24-8)[67,](#page-25-4)[85\\]](#page-26-3). The YMB and YMA contained 3 g/L of yeast extract and 3 g/L of malt extract. Different growth condition parameters of the liquid and solid culture of *I. obliquus*, were tested: Three pH (5, 6.2, and 7.5) and three temperatures (22 ◦C, 28 ◦C, and 37 ◦C) in presence or not of white birch bark (50 µg/mL) or betulin (15 µg/mL). ', '3.2.1. optimization of growth conditions for solid medium To optimize the mycelial culture on solid media, the effect of pH, temperature, and the presence of white birch bark (50 µg/mL) were investigated. *I. obliquus* was initially grown for 14 days on a YMA medium in petri dish in absence of light. A disc of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> was cut after 14 days of culture, and then it was transferred into other plate under different conditions for 14 days in absence of light. The growth diameter was measured, in triplicate, every two days on the Petri dish [\\[86,](#page-26-4)[87\\]](#page-26-5). In order to sustain the culture of *I. obliquus,* mycelium was maintained on YMA Petri dishes for three months in an incubator at 28 ◦C and then stored at 4 ◦C. Based on preliminary results obtained from the optimization of growth in a solid culture, and in order to reduce the parameters in liquid cultures, the optimization of the liquid cultures of *I. obliquus* was carried out at 28 ◦C, which yielded the best growth of the isolate. ', '3.2.2. optimization of growth conditions for liquid medium To initiate a liquid culture of *I. obliquus*, a one-centimeter<sup>2</sup> disc was collected from a fresh solid culture of mycelium in a YMA medium. The mycelium pre-culture was grown in flask of 250 mL with 30 mL of yeast malt broth (YMB) at 28 ◦C on a rotary shaker incubator at 150 rpm for 8 days. Then, to investigate the effect of pH (5, 6.2 and 7.5), an aliquot of 10 mL of the mycelium was transferred to 250 mL flask containing 100 mL of YMB at different pH, incubated at 28 ◦C on a rotary shaker (Thermofisher Scientific) at 150 rpm in absence of light for 8 days. The mycelium was sampled every 48 h by sequential filtration, washed several times with distilled water, and then was dried overnight ', '*3.3. isolation of rna* at 70 ◦C. Ten mL aliquote of 8 days *I. obliquus* liquid pre-culture were aseptically added to 250 mL flask containing 100 mL of a YMB medium supplemented or not with 0.2% DMSO (Control), 15 µg/mL of betulin (BET), or 50 µg/mL of white birch bark (WBB), and grown for 8 days on a rotary incubator at 150 rpm and 28 ◦C in absence of light. The *I. obliquus* mycelium was collected after 8 days of growth. The mycelium was filtered, frozen with liquid N2, and then placed in a 2 mL tube with 2 mL of TRIzol reagent (Fisher Scientific, Toronto, Canada). The mycelia were crushed using the TissueLyser II (QIAGEN, Qiagen Retsch GmbH, Hannover, Germany) using the stainless steel beads with 5 mm diameter (QIAGEN, Qiagen Retsch GmbH, Hannover, Germany) at speed of 30 strokes per second for 3 min until a homogeneous sample was obtained. The tubes were incubated on ice for 5 min, and then 400 µL of chloroform were added. The tubes were vigorously vortexed for 15 s and incubated in an ice bath for 3 min. After centrifugation at 13,000× *<sup>g</sup>* for 15 min at 4 ◦C, two phases were obtained, which were separated by cellular debris—the clear phase of the supernatant was recovered and transferred into another clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. RNA was precipitated with the addition of 700 µL isopropanol, followed by incubation at −20 ◦C for 3 h. Finally, precipitated RNA was collected by centrifugation at 13,000× *g* for 15 min at 4 ◦C, and the pellets were washed once with 1 mL of ice cold 75% ethanol and air dried briefly at room temperature. Then, they were centrifuged again at 13,000× *g* for 5 min at 4 ◦C. The RNA pellets were resuspended using 20 µL of nuclease free water. The quality and quantity of RNA extracted from the samples under different conditions were verified using the Nanodrop and the Bioanalyzer. Only samples with an RNA Integrity number higher than 8 were selected for Illumina sequencing. ', '*3.4. transcriptome sequencing, de novo assembly and functional annotation* Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 4000, PE 100 paired ends, at McGill University and Genome Québec Innovation Centre (Montreal, QC, Canada) on cDNA Libraries converted from isolated high-quality mRNA. Among the raw reads obtained from Illumina sequencing, low quality reads, reads with unknown nucleotides, and reads with adapters were found (Table [3\\)](#page-15-0). Trimmomatic was used to remove the adapters from sequencing and trimmed reads from the 3<sup>0</sup> end and further filtered all reads below 50 bp in order to obtain clean reads [\\[88\\]](#page-26-6). However, once the data from the surviving pairs were generated, Trinity normalization was performed to remove redundant reads in datasets without affecting its *k*-mer content [\\[89\\]](#page-26-7). De novo assembly of cleaned and standardized reads was performed using Trinity (v2.6.5) assembler [\\[90\\]](#page-26-8). Trinity method assembles the RNA-Seq reads into full-length transcripts, which are called contigs or unigenes. All the unigenes were aligned to the public protein database uniprot\\_sprot.trinotate\\_v2.0.pep protein database using the BLASTX program against the NCBI BLAST families using an E-value of 10−<sup>5</sup> . Top BLAST hits were used for annotation of component/gene for each transcript. To quantify the gene transcript abundance, the raw RNA-Seq reads were mapped to assembled transcripts with Bowtie [\\[91\\]](#page-26-9) using default parameters. The gene transcript abundance was calculated as transcripts per kilobase million (TPM) using the RSEM package [\\[92\\]](#page-26-10). Functional annotations of unigenes were performed using Trinotate (http://[trinotate.github.io](http://trinotate.github.io/)/), by aligning our transcripts to Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics databases (Swiss-Prot) with BLASTX and by identifying protein domains (HMMER/PFAM), protein signal peptides, transmembrane domains prediction (signalP/tmHMM), and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG). Then, the functional annotation of unigenes was compared to currently curated annotation databases (EMBL Uniprot eggNOG/GO Pathways databases). The Trinity assembly and functional annotation of unigenes were integrated as an annotation report into an SQLite database. | Library                                                       | Nb of Reads | Nb of Bases    | |---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------| | RNA-Seq of Inonotus obliquus cell culture: Control 1          | 41,874,533  | 8,374,906,600  | | RNA-Seq of Inonotus obliquus cell culture: Control 2          | 19,534,645  | 3,906,929,000  | | RNA-Seq of Inonotus obliquus cell culture: Control 3          | 22,008,711  | 4,401,742,200  | | RNA-Seq of Inonotus obliquus cell culture: Betulin1           | 25,264,465  | 5,052,893,000  | | RNA-Seq of Inonotus obliquus cell culture: Betulin2           | 20,205,852  | 4,041,170,400  | | RNA-Seq of Inonotus obliquus cell culture: Betulin3           | 22,305,852  | 4,461,046,200  | | RNA-Seq of Inonotus obliquus cell culture: White birch bark 1 | 17,766,031  | 3,553,206,200  | | RNA-Seq of Inonotus obliquus cell culture: White birch bark 2 | 16,318,641  | 3,263,728,200  | | RNA-Seq of Inonotus obliquus cell culture: White birch bark 3 | 28,913,696  | 5,872,739,200  | | RNA-Seq of Inonotus obliquus cell culture: White birch bark 4 | 15,777,829  | 3,155,565,800  | | Total                                                         | 229,970,255 | 46,083,926,800 | <span id=""page-15-0""></span>**Table 3.** List of *Inonotus obliquus* RNA-Seq library sequenced using Illumina HiSeq4000 deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under the accession PRJNA526077.

']nan","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.",['**2. results and discussion** '],"['**4. conclusions** This research allowed us to define the best growth conditions to conduct qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq de novo assembly of Québec *Inonotus obliquus*.

High-quality transcriptomes were obtained, and based on genes annotations, we were allowed to identify of transcripts encoding 18 enzymes playing a key role in the terpenoid pathway. This led us to identify novel gene sequences encoding biosynthetic enzymes involved in the terpenoid pathway in chaga. The transcriptomic analysis of this medicinal fungus has led to the discovery of new genes that can be used as a reference for future genetic and genomic studies on chaga and other related medicinal species. Moreover, this transcriptome assembly may also be used as a reference platform for studies on fungus Hymenochaetaceae family. Beyond the biological impact, the data can be used as a reference to provide gene sequences for metabolic engineering and should pave the way for advanced fungal biology and biotechnology to produce valuable chaga terpenoids. **Author Contributions:** Conceptualization, Y.B.; H.G. and I.D.-P.; Methodology, N.F.; Y.B.; H.G. and I.D.-P.; Validation, N.F.; K.C.G.d.S.; N.d.M.; F.A.; H.G. and I.D.-P.; Formal analysis, N.F.; N.d.M. and I.D.-P.

59,TA035884,10.3390/molecules19068303,"Evidence for the involvement of spinal cord-inhibitory and cytokines-modulatorymechanisms in the anti-hyperalgesic effect of hecogenin acetate, a steroidalsapogenin-acetylated, in mice.","Hecogenin is a steroidal sapogenin largely drawn from the plants of the genusAgave, commonly known as 'sisal', and is one of the important precursors used bythe pharmaceutical industry for the synthesis of steroid hormones. Hecogeninacetate (HA) is a steroidal sapogenin-acetylated that produces antinociceptiveactivity. Thus, we evaluate the antihyperalgesic profile of HA in mice ininflammatory models, as well as its possible involvement with c-fos expression onspinal cord area and cytokines to produces analgesic profile. Acute pretreatmentwith HA (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg; i.p.) inhibited the development of mechanicalhyperalgesia induced by carrageenan, TNF-α, dopamine and PGE2. Additionally, theimmunofluorescence data demonstrated that acute pretreatment with HA, at alldoses tested, significantly inhibited Fos-like expression in the spinal corddorsal horn normally observed after carrageenan-inflammation. Moreover, HA didnot affect the motor performance of the mice as tested in the Rota rod test. Thisantinociceptive profile seems to be related, at least in part, to a reduction ofpro-inflammatory cytokines, as IL-1β. The present results suggest that HAattenuates mechanical hyperalgesia by blocking the neural transmission of pain atthe spinal cord levels and by cytokines-inhibitory mechanisms.","Quintans, Jullyana S S, Barreto, Rosana S S, de Lucca, Waldecy Jr, Villarreal, Cristiane F, Kaneto, Carla M, Soares, Milena B P, Branco, Alexsandro, Almeida, Jackson R G S, Taranto, Alex G, Antoniolli, Angelo R, Freitas, Rivelilson M, Quintans, Lucindo J Jr",2014,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"Pain management remains one of the greatest challenges of contemporary medicine, nevertheless, there are a relatively limited list of treatment options for pain. Although a considerable number of analgesic drugs are available for the treatment of painful disorders, the search for development of new compounds as therapeutic alternatives continues since the available analgesic drugs exert a wide range of side effects. In this regard, opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been the main stay of pain treatment. Presently, there is concern that success in the development of new analgesic agents is limited.Although the expansion of synthetic medicinal chemistry in the last decades caused the proportion of new drugs based on natural products to drop to ~50%, 13 natural product–derived drugs were approved in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2005 and 2007, with five of them being the first members of new classes. For the treatment of pain the latest example of the natural product approved by FDA is Ziconotide (Prialt®), a peptide toxin obtained from Conus magus (marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae), and it is the first member in the new drug class of selective N-type voltage-sensitive calcium-channel blockers. Currently, because of their relatively low cost and easy availability in several countries (mainly developing countries), natural products could be used as synthetic models of more selective and powerful drugs.Hecogenin is a steroidal sapogenin largely drawn from the plants of the genus Agave (commonly known as ‘sisal’), and belongs to family Agavaceae, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. ‘Sisal’ species possess both commercial importance (as source of industrial fibers) and medicinal importance and they have been used in Chinese medicine for the treatment of scabies and tumors, as well as for painful and inflammatory conditions. The steroidal sapogenins obtained from ‘sisal’ species (mainly diosgenin and hecogenin) are important precursors used by the pharmaceutical industry for the synthesis of steroid hormones, such as adrenal cortical hormones (cortisone, cortisol, prednisolone, prednisone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, triamcinolone, etc.), sexual hormones (progesterone), and protein anabolic hormones (stanozolol, methandienone). However, there is little scientific information about the biological properties of hecogenin in painful and inflammatory conditions. Peana et al. demonstrated hecogenin reduced paw edema induced by carrageenin, but also produced gastric mucous lesions in higher doses. Cerqueira et al. proposed that the anti-inflammatory property of hecogenin was produced by COX-2 inhibition. Conversely, theses authors demonstrated that pretreatment with hecogenin produced significant gastroprotective profile mediated by K+ATP channels. Recently, our group reported that hecogenin acetate (HA) (Figure 1), a steroidal sapogenin-acetylated, possesses antinociceptive activity using the tail-flick test and suggested the possible involvement of descending pain-inhibitory mechanisms. Now, the antinociceptive effect of HA was investigated in inflammatory hyperalgesia models on mice, examining HA-evoked cFos immunoreactivity in spinal cords levels and cytokines enhancement by RT-PCR technique. We hypothesized that HA may be acting by spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms to produces anti-hyperalgesic profile and that the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines may contribute to this analgesic effect.","All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (CEPA/UFS # 04/12) at the Federal University of Sergipe, and handling procedures were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH - National Institutes of Health) for the use of animals in pain research. Male Swiss mice (32–39 g), 2–3 months of age, were used throughout this study. The animals were randomly housed in appropriate cages at 21 ± 2 °C on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) with free access to food (Purina®, Brazil) and water. Before the experiments, the animals were acclimatized to the laboratory for at least 1h. Mice were used only once in each test. Experiments were carried out between 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. in a quiet room. All experiments involving the behavioral analysis were carried out by the same visual observer and in a double-blind manner.Mechanical hyperalgesia was tested in mice as reported by Cunha et al., with alterations as previously published. In a quiet room, mice were placed in acrylic cages (12 × 10 × 17 cm) with wire-grid floors 15–30 min before starting the test. This method consisted of evoking a hindpaw flexion reflex with a hand-held force transducer (electronic anesthesiometer, Model EFF 302, Insight®, Ribeirão Preto-SP, Brazil) adapted with a polypropylene tip. The investigator was trained to apply the tip perpendicularly to the central area of the hindpaw with a gradual increase in pressure. The end point was characterized by the paw withdrawal followed by clear flinching movements. After this response, the intensity of the pressure was automatically recorded. The intensity of stimulus was obtained by averaging four measurements performed with minimal intervals of 3 min. The animals were tested before and after treatments.Mice were divided into five groups (n = 8, per group), which were treated with vehicle (saline + tween 80, 0.2 mL for 1 mL - saline; i.p.), hecogenin acetate (HA, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg; i.p.), indomethacin (10 mg/kg; i.p.) or dipyrone (60 mg/kg; i.p.). Thirty min after treatment, 20 μL of carrageenan (300 µg/paw), PGE2 (100 ng/paw), DA (30 μg/paw) or TNF-α (100 pg/paw) were injected subcutaneously into the subplantar region of the hindpaw, as described by Cunha et al. and Villarreal et al.. The degree of hyperalgesia was evaluated at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h after the injection of hyperalgesic agents.To evaluate the possible non-specific muscle-relaxant or sedative effects of hecogenin acetate in the doses used, mice were submitted to the rota-rod test (AVS®, Brazil) according to Quintans-Junior et al.. The animals were selected 24 h previously by eliminating those mice which did not remain on the bar for two consecutive periods of 240 s. Mice were pre-treated with diazepam (DZP, 3 mg/kg, i.p., reference drug), HA (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (saline + Tween 80, 0.2 mL for 1 mL-saline, i.p.) and 1 h later were placed on a rotating rod. The latency to falling was measured up to 180 s. The results are expressed as the average time (s) during which the animals remained on the rota-rod apparatus in each group.Ninety minutes after the intraperitoneal injection of HA at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/Kg or vehicle (Saline + Tween 80, 0.2 mL for 1 mL-saline), the animals (n = 6, per group) were perfused with phosphate buffer (0.01 M) saline isotonic (PBS) followed by 10% buffered formalin (100 mM). The spinal cord (L4-L6) were removed and stored at −80 °C for the imunofluorescence against Fos protein.The protocol for immunofluorescence was based on prior. Frozen serial transverse sections (20 µm) of the whole spinal cord were collected on gelatinized glass slides. After washing with PBS, the slices were incubated with 0.1 M glycine in PBS for 10 min. Non-specific protein binding was blocked by the incubation of the sections for 30 min in a solution containing 2% BSA. Then, the sections were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-Fos as primary antibodies (1:2000). Afterwards, the sections were incubated for 2 hr with donkey anti-rabbit IgG -Alexa Fluor 594 (1:2000). Sections were cover slipped with Fluoromount G. As a control for non-specific labeling, sections were incubated without primary antibody. After each stage, slides were washed with PBS five times for 5 min.Light level photomicrographs of spinal cord sections were acquired for each animal with an Axioskop 2 plus, Carl Zeiss®, Germany. Neurons were counted by the free software Image J (National Institute of Health) using a plug-in (written by the authors) that uses the same level of label intensity to select and count the Fos-positive cells.Mice were slightly anesthetized with halothane and received 10 µL of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA; 1 mg/mL of heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 85% paraffin oil and 15% mannide monoleate; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) subcutaneously in the plantar region of the right hind paw, according to a method reported previously. The transcription of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha), IL-1β (Interleukin 1 beta), IL-6 (Interleukin 6), IL-10 (Interleukin 10) and COX-2 (cyclooxygenase type 2) genes was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in mice sacrificed two hours after the CFA injection. Total RNA was isolated from the paw tissue with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, California, CA, USA), and the concentration was determined by photometric measurement. High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to synthesize cDNA from 1 μg of RNA following the manufacturer’s recommendations. qRT-PCR assays were performed to detect the expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and COX-2 genes. Amplification mixtures for qRT-PCR contained 20 ng template cDNA, 10 μL Taqman Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and probes in a final volume of 20 μL. All reactions were run in duplicate on an ABI7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) under standard thermal cycling conditions. Experiments with coefficients of variation greater than 5% were excluded. A no-template control (NTC) and no-reverse transcription controls (No-RT) were also included. The results are presented as the fold-increase of expression of the individual mRNAs, with the target internal control GADPH using the cycle threshold method. λ-Carrageenan, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), dopamine (DA), ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), Tween 80, fluoromount G, glycine and bovine serum albumin (BSA) and hecogenin acetate (HA, ~90% purity) were purchased from Sigma (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Indomethacin and dipyrone were purchased from União Quimica (Brazil). c-Fos Antibody, a rabbit polyclonal IgG, was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas, TX, USA) and Alexa Fluor® 488, a Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), was obtained from Life technology (Grand Island, New York, NY, USA).Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of measurements made on 6–8 animals in each group. Comparisons between three or more treatments were made using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test. In all cases, differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were carried out using Graph Pad Prism 5.0 (Graph Pad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).","The current study shows that systemic administration of hecogenin acetate (HA) could able to reduced inflammatory hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner and its reduce fos expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord normally produced by carrageenan suggesting it reduces central excitability.As showed in Figure 2, intraplantar injection of carrageenan (300 µg/paw) induced a significant increase in the number of responses to 0.6 g force applied to the inflamed hindpaw when compared to baseline. The increased number of responses was maintained from 30 to 180 min after the carrageenan administration. The systemic administration of HA (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) produced an anti-hyeralgesic effect in this model. Specifically mice treated with HA, all doses, 30 min before carrageenan administration exhibited a significant reduction in the number of responses to repeated application of the 0.6 g mechanical force at all evaluated times, when compared with animals vehicle-treated (control group). As expected, the reference drug (indomethacin, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) showed reductions in the number of responses to the 0.6 g force (Figure 2A). The group of animals that received saline in the sub plantar region, instead of carrageenan, did not present any alteration on the threshold of sensitivity towards the mechanical stimuli (data not shown).The inhibitory effect of HA (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) on the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by TNF-α is shown in Figure 2B. Hecogenin acetate (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg) was able to reduce mechanical hyperalgesia induced by TNF-α, when compared with animals of the control group (vehicle-treated), similarly to the reference drug (indomethacin, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Figure 2C shows the inhibitory effect of HA on the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by dopamine. HA, in a higher dose, was able to reduce mechanical hyperalgesia induced by dopamine, when compared with animals of the vehicle group. Intraplantar administration of PGE2 induced a marked mechanical hypersensitivity that was significantly reduced by dipyrone (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and by hecogenin acetate at 5–20 mg/kg, as shown in Figure 2D. The analgesic potency of hecogenin acetate attributed to its ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines production and seems to be comparable to dipyrone and indomethacin at higher doses. However, future studies should further evaluate the potency of hecogenin acetate compared to other drugs reference.Hyperalgesia induced by i.pl. injection of carrageenan is widely used for evaluating new anti-hyperalgesic drugs in rodents. In experiments using mice, injection of carrageenan into the plantar surface of animal hind paws produced inflammation and hyperalgesia with similar temporal profile. In this model, there is the occurrence of non-immunereaction, involving inflammatory mediators, including arachidonic acid products (PGE2), mast cells products (histamine, 5-HT), neuropeptides, cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα), NO, nerve growth factor (NGF), leukotrienes B4 (LTB4) and transcription factors (NF-κB). According to Cunha et al., this cascade of signalization leads to the release of prostanoids and sympathomimetic amines. Therefore, those final inflammatory mediators can activate peripheral Aδ and C fiber sensory nerve terminals, thus causing the release of substance P and neurokinin A, leading to increases in local blood flow and vascular permeability.Cytokines produced after i.pl. injection of carrageenan may exert in direct cytotoxic effects by the release of NO, reactive oxygen species, eicosanoids and excitatory amino acids (EAA - glutamate and aspartate) EAA. Alternatively, IL-1β induced by carrageenan might sensitize spinal neurons through the induction of nociceptive neuropeptides expression, such as substance P (SP) and nerve growth factor (NGF). It also has been shown that nociceptive stimulus induced by glutamate, PGs, histamine or 5-HT carrageenan-induced release resulted on direct nociceptors sensitization, culminating with simultaneous thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. We showed that acute HA administration, all doses, was able to reverse the hyperalgesic response induced by carrageenan, thus suggesting a possible inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cascade.It is well know that cytokine TNF-α is recognized as a potent pro-inflammatory endogenous substance, which is rapidly produced in large quantities by macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial infection. TNF-α interacts with target cells through high-affinity membrane receptors, as tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR1 or p55) and type 2 (TNFR2 or p75). Thus, TNF-α-induced hyperalgesia is mediated by prostanoids and sympathetic amines. We demonstrated that HA was able to reverse the hyperalgesic response induced by TNF-α, thus suggesting a possible inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cascade, as observed with the treatment with indomethacin.Taking those findings into account, we evaluated whether the antinociceptive activity of hecogenin acetate involves the blockade of sensitization or activation of the nociceptor through evaluation of its effect on hyperalgesia induced by PGE2 and dopamine. As the hyperalgesia induced by these mediators is independent of the final production of other inflammatory mediators or recruitment of cells, such as neutrophils and as it has been demonstrated that HA administration was able to maintain the baseline nociceptive threshold, we can then suggest the possibility that HA interacts with dopamine or EP receptors; consequently, the paths of its analgesic effects may be through the action not only at the inflammatory level but also from a possible involvement of neuronal pathways, as suggested by Brito et al. and Gama et al.. In fact, the acute pretreatment with hecogenin acetate increased threshold sensitivity towards mechanical stimuli in carrageenan-, TNF-α, PGE2- or dopamine-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, this compound is suggested to have produced an inhibition of the inflammatory cascade. Previously, Peana et al. and Cerqueira et al. have shown the antiedematogenic and anti-inflammatory effects of hecogenin, and they demonstrated that anti-inflammatory activity of hecogenin may be involvement inhibitory of cytokines pathway, at least partially. This hypothesis has been confirmed by our results of Real Time PCR analysis when we demonstrated that HA treatment could inhibit the expression of IL-1β (Figure 3). However, acute treatment with HA did not alter TNF-α (Figure 3B), and IL-6 (Figure 3C); and the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Figure 3D). In addition, Cerqueira et al. proposed that hecogenin, as non-acetylated, increased COX-2 expression in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rodents and who also suggest that hecogenin produces beneficial effect in gastric injury through mechanisms involving the inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration and lipid peroxidation, up-regulation of the COX-2/PG pathway and K+ATP channels. Differently, we demonstrated that acute treatment with HA was not able to change COX-2 expression, by assessed mRNA COX-2 levels (Figure 4).As it is well known, peripheral or central opioid receptor activation could lead to the decrease of the pain sensation towards an inflammatory stimulus, through the NO-cGMP-K+ATP channel pathway activation. Based on both suggestions that HA promotes regulation of K+ATP channels and the inhibitory effect of opioids on the spinal nociceptive transmission, and as our group has recently demonstrated, for the first time, that systemic administration of HA, at doses that did not induce motor performance alterations, produced consistent antinociceptive effect, probably mediated by opioid system and descending pain-inhibitory pathways activation, we investigated whether analgesic-like profile of HA was due to the involvement of spinal cord dorsal horn pathways through immunohistochemical approach.Ninety minutes after the intraperitoneal injection of HA, the average number of neurons showing Fos protein in the spinal cord dorsal horn was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced (Figure 5) at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/Kg when compared with control (Vehicle).The superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord, particularly substantia gelatinosa (SG), is a major projection site of small-diameter afferent nerve fibers that predominantly transmit nociceptive signals. SG neurons also receive descending inputs from the brainstem. Baba et al. demonstrated using an in vitro spinal cord slice preparation that peripheral inflammation can facilitate A-beta fiber-mediated synaptic inputs to dorsal horn of the spinal cord, mainly SG, and also produce an increase in c-fos expression.The protooncogene c-fos, when activated, makes the immunologically detectable nuclear protein Fos. A striking attribute of Fos is that it is rapidly expressed in central neurons after noxious stimuli. Previous studies demonstrated that the increased c-fos expression is a transient reaction of spinal neurons in painful conditions, as in chronic pain. The causes of that spinal cord nociceptive neuronal hyperactivity during certain types of pain remain unclear. It may derive from the constant barrage of peripheral input, but may also reflect impairments of descending modulation, as previously showed by HA. Anyway, the value of the analysis of Fos expression to monitor the nociceptive activity of large neuronal populations is solid.In addition, CNS-depressant drugs, such as gabapentin, frequently used as analgesic in some types of painful conditions, inhibit glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission at the spinal dorsal horn and decrease Fos expression when they produce analgesic effect. Thus, our results suggests that the inhibition of neuronal hyperactivity at the spinal cord dorsal horn (by a significantly decrease of Fos expression) could account for the analgesic efficacy of hecogenin acetate, in all doses tested, in carrageenan-induced inflammatory nociception. Hence, it may also decrease neuronal activation at the spinal cord horn, by depressing descending facilitation through periaqueductal gray (PAG) activation, as previously demonstrated by our group.Earlier studies suggested that the CNS depression and the non-specific muscle relaxation effects can reduce the response of motor coordination and might invalidate the behavioral test results, including mechanical hyperalgesic tests. Since Brito et al. showed the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of hecogenin and as these activities can induce impair in motor coordination, we assessed that acute treatment with HA, at the doses tested, did not have any performance alteration in the rota-rod apparatus (data no shown).",,"Together, our results clearly indicate that HA displays significant anti-hyperalgesic effect in animal protocols. The precise mechanism by which HA promotes its effects is not clear, but the compound’s ability to modulate spinal cord dorsal horn and inhibit IL-1β expression appear to be likely one of the possible mechanisms. However, it is possible that another central or peripheral mechanism, not studied in present work, may be related to the analgesic effect of hecogenin acetate. Therefore, this steroidal sapogenin may be of potential interest in the development of new clinically relevant drugs for the management of painful conditions."

Medicinal plants, e.g., Lavandula dentata L., are rich inphenolic compounds and may provide neuroprotective and anti-inflammatorybenefits. However, limited research evaluates their effectiveness in modulatingneuroinflammation and histopathological changes in epilepsy models. Therefore,the current study hypothesized that treating Lavandula dentata L. extract oressential oils may reduce neuroinflammatory responses and mitigatehistopathological changes in the brain, providing a natural alternative oradjunct therapy for epilepsy management. Methods: Five groups of male Wistar ratswere used: control, pilocarpine-treated epileptic, valproic acid (VPA-treatedepileptic), L. dentata extract, and essential oils. Numerous electrolyte levels,monoamine levels, neurotransmitter levels, and the mRNA expression of specificgate channel subtypes were evaluated in homogenate brain tissue. Additionally,histological changes in various brain regions were investigated. Results: Theinvestigation revealed that the extract and essential oils obtained from L.dentata L. exhibited the ability to improve the modulation of electrolytes andions across voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Furthermore, it was revealedthat they could decrease neuronal excitability by facilitating repolarization.Moreover, L. dentata's oil and ethanol extract re-balances T-reg/Th-17 cytokines,restoring the pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg markers, e.g., FOXP3 andCTLA-4, to their normal level. Conclusions: The present work confirms that theextract and essential oils of L. dentata L. have different activities toameliorate the progression of histopathological alterations. Therefore, when usedin conjunction with other AEDs, the extract and essential oils of L. dentata canslow the progression of epileptogenesis.","Antar, Aziza, Abdel-Rehiem, Eman S, Al-Khalaf, Areej A, Abuelsaad, Abdelaziz S A, Abdel-Gabbar, Mohamed, Shehab, Gaber M G, Abdel-Aziz, Ayman M",2024,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"Epilepsy is among the most prevalent and incapacitating neurological conditions. With a high rate of pharmaco-resistance, a variety of comorbidities (including progressive cognitive and behavioral disorders), and increased mortality from direct (e.g., sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, accidents, drowning) or indirect effects of seizures and therapies, it is a prevalent disorder that impacts more than 70 million people globally. Considerable investigation utilizing animal models and human subjects has yielded restricted knowledge regarding the mechanisms that underlie epileptogenesis and seizures; furthermore, these findings have not resulted in substantial reductions in pharmaco-resistance, morbidities, or mortality.Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent, unprovoked episodes of seizures due to a disorder in the synchronized activity of neurons. Specific brain regions may experience a neurochemical imbalance due to uncontrolled status epilepticus (SE). Excessive production of free radicals has been linked to the development of neuronal hyperactivity and/or excitotoxicity. The term “epilepsy” describes a group of illnesses characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures that appear to be the consequence of complicated processes involving numerous neurotransmitter systems, including glutamatergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems. It is brought on by sporadic, highly coordinated electric neuronal bursts that affect the brain’s tiny or large neuronal networks, impairing mental function, movement, awareness, or a combination of these symptoms.Several novel antiepileptic medicines (AEDs) have been approved for the treatment of seizures. The prevention of seizures is the primary goal of AED medication. As a result, once patients have achieved a seizure-free state, avoiding even a single seizure revolution occurrence is critical. Individuals with epilepsy, particularly those who are seizure-free, require consistency and certainty in their AED prescription to avoid breakthrough seizures. About 25% of epileptic individuals have drug-resistant epilepsy. Their weak control over epileptic seizures (ESs) puts them at risk for early mortality, trauma, and psychological problems, and it also lowers their quality of life. Four percent of adult cases of drug-resistant epilepsy go into remission each year; rates are higher in children. However, recurrence of ES is possible at any time. Therefore, to start the pre-surgical evaluation process, it is essential to identify patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and decide on other prospective therapeutic alternatives in specialized units or centers.While antiepileptic medicine has been shown to enhance cognitive function, it is essential to note that it is also associated with a significant incidence of cognitive adverse effects. Mental side effects are therapeutically substantial in that they may affect treatment adherence, long-term memory retention, various aspects of daily functioning, and overall health-related quality of life. While antiepileptic medicine has been shown to enhance cognitive function, it is essential to note that it is also associated with a significant incidence of cognitive adverse effects. Mental side effects are therapeutically substantial in that they may affect treatment adherence, long-term memory retention, various aspects of daily functioning, and overall health-related quality of life. The present analysis assesses and evaluates the subject matter.One of the key areas of research right now is looking for new antiepileptic drugs that can also protect neurons. Using plants and plant extracts to treat illness is an example of a therapeutic method. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), traditional techniques, primarily using plants, provide healthcare for approximately 75% of the world’s population. Therefore, the folk medicines that were turned into natural medicines have been essential in the progress of modern drugs. It can be utilized to find an alternate source of AEDs with innovative structures and enhanced safety and effectiveness profiles. It can also be combined with low-dosage medications. Medicinal plants are good at treating various illnesses because they contain several active chemicals, mainly phenolic products like flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, stilbenes, and others. Several substances have been shown to have antioxidant qualities. They might help protect against the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species.The genus Lavandula belongs to the Labiatae family (Lamiaceae). Lavandula species can be found all around the Mediterranean region and are grown in France, Spain, and Italy. The perfume, cosmetic, flavoring, and pharmaceutical industries all depend on the essential oil of Lavandula species. Lavender oils (LOs) are primarily used as raw materials in industrial perfume and fragrance products, with most lavender oils used this way. Malcolm and Tallian discovered that LO oral solutions help people feel calm and relaxed more quickly than first-line anxiety medications such benzodiazepines and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. As Sayorwan, Siripornpanich say, this calm effect is caused by LO’s impact on the autonomous nervous system (ANS). Essential oils are attracting more attention lately as a way to treat several nerve illnesses. The biological effect of L. dentata oil could partly be explained by an inhibitory action on NMDA glutamate receptors. Therefore, it was found that LEO can improve learning and memory in Alzheimer’s Disease via AMPA glutamate receptors.Lavandula dentata has recently had a long history of traditional medicinal use in medical treatments, adding flavor to recipes or infusions and culinary applications. L. dentata has been reported to be used for food therapy, intestinal issues, respiratory infections, and cough problems. Its essential oils are used in aromatherapy for calming and relaxing properties. Furthermore, L. dentata is recognized for its anti-arthritic properties, which help reduce arthritis and inflammation. On the other hand, L. dentata essential oil is known for its antibacterial, diuretic, and healing properties. It is commonly used in infusion or decoctions to treat cold symptoms and infections such as renal coli.However, until today, there were no reports on the neuroinflammatory, histopathological alterations, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and FoxP3+ Treg cell activities of Lavandula dentata L. in the case of an epileptic rat model. Therefore, the novel objectives of the current study were to evaluate the antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties of the ethanolic extract and essential oils derived from Lavandula dentata L in a rat model and study its ability to modulate FOXP3+ regulatory T cells and restore immune balance, which was not previously documented.","Forty mature male Wister rats, weighing 150–180 g, were obtained from the animal laboratory at the National Research Institute in Dokki, Giza, Egypt. The subjects were housed in separate metabolic cages within a controlled environment, maintaining a temperature of 23 ± 1 °C and a humidity level of 55%. The lighting conditions followed a 12 h light/dark cycle. A wide range of drinks and food was readily accessible. The experimental protocols adhered to the guidelines for the care and utilization of laboratory animals and were adequately reviewed by the animal research ethics committee of Beni-Suef University, with the assigned approval number BSU/FS/2021/021/138.The pharmaceuticals and chemicals utilized in this study included pilocarpine hydrochloride (99%) (PILO), which was procured from MP Biomedicals located in Solon, OH, USA (SKU:02151892-CF). Valium and methylscopolamine were procured from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., located in Nanjing, China. The valproic acid, specifically the brand Depakine Chrono®500 mg, was purchased from Sanofi Aventis CO., Paris, France a pharmaceutical company. The valproic acid falls under the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code N03AG01.Aerial parts of Lavandula dentata L. were collected from the Taif region in Saudi Arabia in May 2018 when the plant was still growing. A voucher specimen was deposited in the herbarium. In contrast, it was identified, authenticated, and described with the aid of the Flora & Phyto-Taxonomy Research, Horticultural Research Institute, Agricultural Research Centre 12618, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt. Briefly, extraction and characterization of Lavandula dentata L.: About 250 whole dried plant material was coarsely milled and extracted with 70% ethanol via ultrasonic assistant extraction bath at room temperature till exhaustion (3 times). The pooled ethanol extracts were evaporated under a vacuum at 45 °C till evaporation of the organic solvent, and part of the remaining aqueous extract was freeze-dried to produce 47 g of greenish residue. Chemical component identification was accomplished by comparing mass spectra with genuine standards from the NIST/EPA/MSDC Mass Spectral Database and retention indices concerning alkanes (C8–C20). Peak area normalization was used to generate quantitative data without the need for correction factors).Seizure induction was applied according to Turski, Ikonomidou, and Abdel-Reheim. Briefly, before receiving 300 mg/kg of pilocarpine hydrochloride (PILO), each study rat received a dose of 1 mg/kg of methylscopolamine for 30 min. Rats’ behavior was observed for 120 min to determine whether or not specific criteria were met for seizure activity. An epileptic’s ability to exhibit symptoms of convulsions, tremors, salivation, and drowsiness was one of the conditions for becoming a good model.Forty grown male Wister rats weighing between 150 and 180 g were used in this study. They were split into five groups of eight rats each. The groups were as follows: (1) The control group (C) was fed a standard meal and had unlimited access to sterile water. At the same time as the treatment groups, they were orally administered PBS (pH 7.4; 0.2 mL/rat) via an intragastric tube. (2) Epileptic group (EP) was given 300 mg/kg of PILO injection, as previously described. (3) The group of epileptic rats treated with valproic acid (EP-VPA) was administered by the drug via intragastric intubation. Following this, they received an injection of 300 mg/kg of PILO, as described in earlier studies (Raza, Dhariwal and Ortinski and Meador). Additionally, the rats were orally fed 500 mg/kg of VPA diluted in PBS (pH 7.4; 0.2 mL/rat). The VPA sessions were conducted twice a week for a consecutive duration of four weeks, agreeing with the scheduling pattern observed in the other groups. (4) The epileptic group receiving L. dentata pure oil treatment (EP-LO): Following the previously mentioned injection of 300 mg/kg of PILO, the rats were given an oral diet containing 100 μg of L. dentata oil per kilogram of body weight, suspended in PBSS (pH 7.4; 0.2 mL/rat). Using intragastric intubation, the oil feeding was carried out every day for four weeks at intervals consistent with the other groups. (5) The epileptic group receiving L. dentata pure oil treatment (EP-LX): Following the previously mentioned injection of 300 mg/kg of PILO, rats were fed a liquid containing 300 mg/kg of ethanol extract of L. dentata mixed with PBSS (pH 7.4; 0.2 mL/rat). The extract feeding was carried out every day for four weeks at intervals consistent with the other groups by inserting a tube into the stomach.Neurotransmitters and electrolytes were assessed in the hippocampal area of the brain, which was cut open and put on plates filled with ice. A Potter–Elvehjem homogenizer (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was used to mix pieces of hippocampal tissue in cold PBS (pH 7.4) with eight up and down strokes of a loose-fitting Teflon pestle with a weight of 1000 g. After filtering, the mixture was put in a Beckman TJ-6 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments; Munich, Germany) and spun at 600× g for 10 min at 4 °C. At −80 °C, the clear supernatant was kept until many papers were examined. The amount of total protein in the supernatant (/gm tissue) was determined. Portions of brain tissue slices were stored at −80 °C in sterile Eppendorf tubes until they were needed for RT-PCR analysis and RNA extraction. The procedure for making neurotransmitters followed the purchased manufacturer’s instructions. Levels of L-DOPA (µg/mL), epinephrine (ng/mL), norepinephrine (pg/mL), glutamate (µg/mL), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, pg/mL) were measured using assay kits from MyBioSource Co. Vancouver, British Columbia: MBS 9357024, MBS 031232, MBS 269993, MBS 047402, and MBS 269152 were the kit catalog numbers. Acetylcholinesterase (U/L) activity was measured by following the instructions provided with the QuantiChromTM Assay Kit (Cat. No. DACE-100). The electrolyte content of both potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) (mMol/L) were measured in either brain homogenate tissue or blood, according to the MyBioSource handbook. In addition, QuantiChromTM assay’s quantitative colorimetric instruction booklet was also utilized to determine the amounts of calcium (Ca++) and chloride (Cl−) in brain homogenate tissue or blood.Prooxidant and antioxidant activities were assessed in brain homogenate tissues by the production guide purchased from MyBioSource Co. and included with the test kits. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was discovered in the hippocampal region to indicate lipid peroxidation. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) in tissue samples were quantified as malondialdehyde (MDA) using spectrophotometry. Nitric oxide (NO) accelerates the conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, which can be monitored via spectrophotometric measurement. The GPx activity was measured using T-butyl-HPx as a substrate. The quantity of nitro blue tetrazolium (NitroBT) that was decreased with NADH by phenazine methosulfate (PMS) under aerobic circumstances was used to determine the amount of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Adding or being in the presence of superoxide dismutase stopped this reaction. One way to measure catalase (CAT) activity is to watch the loss of H2O2 using spectrophotometry.The process of isolating RNA and performing PCR was done using real-time quantification. The SYBR Green I analysis was conducted using an implemented BioSystem with software version 3.1 (StepOneTM, USA). The qPCR test designates the target primer sequence at a temperature of 60 °C for one minute, which agrees with the annealing temperature. The denaturation temperature was set at 95 °C for one minute, while the extension temperature was maintained at 72 °C for the same duration. This was done 40 times. The comparative threshold (CT) method was used to measure gene expression compared to other genes. The numbers were worked out after comparing the changes in mRNA transcript level to GAPDH. Each experiment was done three times, each time on its own. PCR (RT–PCR) with the following rat-specific primers: Spectrophotometry is used to track the SCN1A (Na+ channel) of H2O2: F; 5-TCATGGCACAGTTCCTGTATC-3; R; 5-GCAGTAGGCAATTAGCAGCAA-3; Kcnj2 (K+ channel): F; 5-GCAAACTCTGCTTGATGTGG-3; R; 5-TCATACAAAGGGCTGTCTTCG-3; CACNA1S (Ca2+ channel): F; 5-GACATAATTCCCGCTGCCTG-3; R; 5-GTTTCCATTCTTCACCCGCC-3; CLCN2 (GABA-receptor): F; 5-CACTGGATAACAACGCCCA-3; R; 5-GCAGGGAATGTAGGTCTGG-3; NMDA (Glutamate Receptor): F; 5-ACTCCACACTGCCCATGAAC-3; R; 5-TTGTTCCCCAAGAGTTTGCTT-3; FOXP3: F; 5-TCATCCGCTGGGCCATCCTG-3; R; 5-GTGGAAACCTCACTTCTTGGTC-3; CTLA4: F; 5-GGACGCAGATTTATGTCATTGATC-3 and R; 5-CCAAGCTAACTGCGACAAGGA-3; and GAPDH: F; 5-GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3; R; 5-CAATGCCAGCCCCAGCG-3.Brain tissue samples were taken and put in a 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) to keep them still for 24 h. To sum up, tap water was used to wash the tissues, and then a run of diluted ethyl alcohol was used to dry them out. Animal parts were cleaned with xylene and then put in a hot oven at 56 °C for 24 h to bury in paraffin. To cut the tissue into five μm slices with a microtome (Leica Microsystems, San Francisco, CA, USA), paraffin wax blocks were first made. The tissue sections were placed onto glass slides and subjected to deparaffinization using xylene, followed by hydration using a sequential sequence of alcohols with concentrations of 100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, and 70%. Subsequently, the specimens were immersed in water and subjected to staining using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) obtained from Sigma. The slides were subsequently examined using a conventional light microscope manufactured by Olympus Optical Corporation in Tokyo, Japan. The scoring system utilized in this study assessed brain alterations, specifically nuclear pyknosis and degeneration in neurons, localized gliosis, and encephalomalacia, on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 (0 meant the brain was normal, 1 meant mild damage, 2 meant moderate damage, and 3 meant severe damage).All possible quantifications for the image analysis were done for the studied layers, e.g., the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus regions. All cells count measurements were performed using the program ImageJ (), and the cell density, number of blood vessels, and layer thickness were examined in all H&E images (six fields/rat/group). The number of cells per unit area (cells/µm2) was also determined, while the fluctuations were measured and tracked. A thorough examination of the differences in cell density between the various rat groups was made possible by this methodical approach, which enabled us to acquire consistent data for the groups.The primary and secondary antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA), which included anti-FoxP3 (Cat. #: AB75763) as the primary antibody and Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (DyLight 488 pre-adsorbed, AB96899) as the secondary antibodies. Immunohistochemistry (Formalin/PFA-fixed paraffin-embedded sections) was performed on rat brain tissue staining FOXP3 using antibody CAT # ab75763 with final conc. 1/100, DAB staining (in brown) and hematoxylin QS as a counterstain (in blue). ImageJ software was used to analyze the histoarchitecture of the FOXP3-positive cells. Six animals were used in each experimental group to gather quantitative data; each animal had 3 to 4 high power fields to be examined, and the values were averaged to represent the animal.The Shapiro–Wilk test was utilized to verify if the current data were expected. Means and standard deviation were employed because the data were regularly distributed. If there was no homogeneity of variance, the Welch Test, a modified ANOVA, was used. The Tukey–Kramer method was employed for doing post hoc analysis of the data, to compare various groups. The means of homogenous subsets’ groups are presented, with each value represented as Mean ± Std and a sample size of n = 8 animals per group. A notable statistical contrast at a significance level of p < 0.05, relating to the same variable and lacking a shared superscript symbol or symbols, was indicated. The data analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20 software program (IBM Corp., 2011).","The brain tissue of the epilepsy group (Table 1) had a notable decrease in sodium (Na+) content, which recorded a decline of 128.89 ± 0.46 mmol/L compared to the control group, which had a higher sodium concentration in tissue. In contrast, the hippocampus homogenate tissue of the PILO-induced epilepsy group (EP) exhibited notable hypernatremia (p < 0.05). Moreover, a statistically significant increase (p < 0.05) in Na+ was observed in the serum of animals treated with valproic acid (EP-VPA) in comparison to the epileptic group. In contrast, the level of sodium ions (Na+) in the hippocampal homogenate tissue valproic acid-treated group (EP-VPA) showed a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05) compared to EP. Furthermore, for oral administration with L. dentata oil (EP-LO) or L. dentata extract (EP-LX), a statistically significant elevation (p < 0.05) in serum sodium (Na+) levels comparable with the EP group (128.89 ± 0.46 mM/mL) was reported, in contrast to a substantial decrease in the homogenate tissue of the EP-LO-treated group, parallel to a nonsignificant reduction (p < 0.05) in EP-LX (Table 1). Moreover, the data presented in Table 1 indicates statistically significant hyperkalemia in EP’s sera (7.13 ± 0.28 mmol/L), in contrast to other groups, e.g., EP-VPA, EP-LO, and EP-LX, which exhibited low potassium contents. In addition, the levels of potassium ions (K+) in the homogenized tissues of the EP group showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) as compared to the control and EP-VPA groups. On the other hand, both EP-LO and EP-LX treatments exhibit more K+ levels in homogenate tissues (Table 1).Regarding ionized calcium (Ca++) in the sera, it was found that there was a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.001) in animals with EP compared to the control and EP-VPA groups. In addition, it was observed that both the EP-LO- and EP-LX-treated groups had a noteworthy elevation (p > 0.05) in the concentration of serum Ca++ (0.76 ± 0.12 and 0.99 ± 0.08 mM/mL, respectively). On the other hand, a statistically significant rise in hypercalcemia (p < 0.001) was noted in the hippocampus homogenate tissue of the EP group (0.60 ± 0.02 mmol/L Tissue) in comparison to the control group (0.30 ± 0.06 mmol/L Tissue). EP-VPA, EP-LO, and EP-LX groups exhibited lower levels of calcemia in contrast to the diseased group (Table 1). Moreover, Table 1 revealed a highly significant hyperchloremia (115.57 ± 2.77 mM/mL) in the EP group’s serum and a highly substantial hypochloremia (73.08 ± 6.45 mM/mL) in their hippocampal homogenate tissues. Furthermore, findings showed that Cl-w was considerably recovered and retained to normal (p > 0.001) in EP-VPAs’ serum or hippocampus homogenate tissues. Additionally, the hippocampal homogenate tissues of EP-LO and EP-LX groups demonstrated a highly significant elevation (p > 0.001), and the Cl− levels in their serum were significantly (p > 0.001) ameliorated to the control level.Regarding the gene expression of some gates, the mRNA expression of SCN1A (Na+) exhibited a statistically significant increase (p < 0.001) in the epileptic group EP (1.44 ± 0.01 versus 1.01 ± 0.01). Conversely, VPA treatment recorded a relative expression of 0.79 ± 0.03 and demonstrated a significant decrease (p < 0.05). Additionally, there was a substantial (p < 0.05) drop in the expression of SCN1A (Na+) mRNA between L. dentata oil (EP-LO) and L. dentata extract (EP-LX), with respective values of 0.81 ± 0.05 and 0.78 ± 0.05 (Table 2).Expression of the potassium gate channel gene KCNJ2 (K+) in the EP group recorded a significant decrease (p < 0.001) (0.36 ± 0.05), while treatment with VPA, LO, LX exhibited a significant increase (p < 0.05) with reported values of 0.62 ± 0.05, 0.65 ± 0.10, and 0.58 ± 0.08, respectively) (Table 2). Moreover, the pilocarpine induction group exhibited the maximum mRNA expression (p < 0.001) of CACNA1S (Cav1.1) (7.07 ± 0.40) compared to controls (1.01 ± 0.01). Also, EP-VPA, EP-LO, and EP-LX groups showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) and recorded the lowest expression (3.17 ± 0.35, 2.87 ± 0.33, and 2.54 ± 0.60, respectively) (Table 2).The GABA receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel. The findings of this study indicate that the expression of CLCNC mRNA in the EP group decreased significantly (p < 0.001) when compared to the group serving as the control (1.03 ± 0.02). Furthermore, it was observed that the mRNA expression of CLCNC was considerably more significant in the EP-VPA, EP-LO, and EP-LX groups (p < 0.05): 0.62 ± 0.03, 0.77 ± 0.08, and 0.56 ± 0.06, versus the EP (0.14 ± 0.03). (Table 2). Furthermore, the present data revealed a significant increase (p < 0.001) in NMDA mRNA gene expression in EP (7.71 ± 1.63) compared to controls (1.01 ± 0.01). On the other hand, there was a substantial decrease (p < 0.05) in the gene expression of mRNA of NMDA in the EP-VPA, EP-LO, and EP-LX groups in comparison to the EP group, but it was still significantly higher than that of healthy condition (Table 2).In terms of changes in neurotransmitters, Table 3 demonstrates that the concentration of L-DOPA in hippocampus homogenate tissue from the EP group was markedly elevated (36.40 ± 2.352 Ug/protein tissue) (p < 0.001) and was greater than that of the controls. Conversely, the hippocampal DOPA level in the VPA-treated group was found to be significantly restored, close to the control (p < 0.05). Additionally, the tissue’s DOPA level was decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after oral administration of L. dentata oil or extract. Moreover, the present data recorded that EP had the highest (p < 0.001) increase in epinephrine concentration (134.67 ± 5.860 pg/mg protein tissue) in contrast to the control group (78.63 ± 2.143 pg/mg protein tissue) (Table 3). Moreover, there was a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in all treated groups, as they EP-VPA, EP-LO, and EP-LX recorded 91.67 ± 2.410, 92.83 ± 1.849, and 93.83 ± 2.167 pg/mg protein tissue, respectively.Concerning norepinephrine (NE), it was noticed that EP showed a statistically significant increased level (p < 0.001) with a mean value of 213.10 ± 8.365 pg/mg protein tissue (Table 3) as compared to the control group (108.67 ± 3.299 pg/mg protein tissue). Significantly, its level in the hippocampal homogenate tissue of both EP-VPA and EP-LX groups was lower (p < 0.05) than the EP group, while EP-LO showed a highly significant reduction in NE level compared to EP (133.03 ± 1.590 pg/mg protein tissue).Furthermore, the EP’s γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) level was significantly decreased (19.13 ± 1.20 pg/mg protein tissue) compared to controls (57.23 ± 0.69 pg/mg protein tissue) (Table 3). On the other hand, GABA concentration inside the hippocampal tissue was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the EP-VPA, EP-LX, and EP-LO groups and ameliorated to normal levels.Regarding brain glutamate in the epileptic group (EP), it recorded (p > 0.001) 24.10 ± 2.065 ng/mg protein tissue, i.e., significantly higher than that of the control group. EP-VPA exhibited a highly significant reduction (p > 0.001) in hippocampal glutamate content (7.50 ± 1.273 ng/mg protein tissue) compared to EP, suggesting that EP-VPA levels are closer to those observed in the control group. Additionally, oral treatment with L. dentata oil (EP-LO) or extract (EP-LX) demonstrated a more pronounced reduction (p > 0.001) in glutamate levels. Additionally, the current investigation demonstrated a statistically significant (p < 0.001) reduction in the brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) level in EP (38.43 ± 3.896 U/mg protein tissue) in contrast to the control group (95.43 ± 3.552 U/mg protein Tumor). Conversely, the AChE level in the hippocampus tissue (73.10 ± 4.351 U/mg) increased significantly (p < 0.05) according to EP-VPA. Based on the information available, oral administration of L. dentata oil (EP-LO) or extract (EP-LX) increased the AChE concentration of homogenate hippocampus tissue by a significant (p < 0.05) amount, with values of 70.87 ± 4.535 and 89.57 ± 4.535 U/gm protein tissue, respectively (Table 3).Lipid peroxidation is articulated as malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration and was measured as a biomarker of oxidative stress in brain tissues. When comparing the hippocampal LPO concentration (99.00 ± 9.00 nmol/g. tissues) of the pilocarpine group to that of the control group (C) (38.00 ± 4.04 nmol/g. tissues), a substantial rise (p > 0.001) was observed (Figure 1A). Conversely, compared to the EP group (99.0 ± 9.0 nmol/g. tissues), the valproic acid-treated (EP-VPA) group had a substantial drop in LPO (p > 0.001) (42.00 ± 5.20 nmol/g. tissues). In comparison to the diseased group EP (99.00 ± 9.00 nmol/g. tissues), the oral treatment with either Lavandula dentata oil (EP-LO) or L. dentata extract (EP-LX) resulted in a significant (p > 0.001) decrease in the LPO levels of the hippocampal homogenate tissue, with recorded values of 52.80 ± 7.27 and 57.00 ± 5.20 nmol/g. tissues, respectively.In synapses, nitric oxide (NO) is thought to function as a retrograde neurotransmitter that facilitates brain blood flow and is crucial for intracellular signaling. In comparison to the control groups (17.08 ± 3.47 mmole/L), Figure 1B demonstrates that the NO recorded tremendously significant increase (p < 0.001) changes in the EP group of 56.02 ± 10.75 mmole/L. The current findings showed that the levels of NO in hippocampus homogenate tissue were significantly lower (p > 0.001) in EP-VPA (15.00 ± 3.86 mmole/L) than in EP (56.02 ± 10.75 mmole/L). According to the current findings, when compared to the non-treated group (EP), oral treatment with either L. dentata oil (EP-LO) or L. dentata extract (EP-LX) resulted in a significant (p > 0.001) drop in NO levels, measuring 14.32 ± 3.80 and 16.60 ± 1.16 mmole/L, respectively.In the epileptic group (EP), the activity of the neural catalase (CAT) enzyme decreased significantly (p > 0.001) to 1.60 ± 0.46 U/g. tissue (Figure 1C), in comparison to the controls. On the other hand, the EP-VPA group recorded a significantly ameliorated level (p > 0.001) of CAT activity (6.58 ± 0.82 U/g. tissue), which appears to approach the control level. In addition, the present data showed that the oral treatment with either L. dentata oil (EP-LO) or extract (EP-LX) showed more significant (p > 0.001) release of CAT levels, which was drawing near the control level and recorded 4.58 ± 0.86 and 4.49 ± 0.55 U/g. tissue, respectively.Unexpectedly, the current biochemical analysis revealed a substantial reduction (p > 0.001) in the SOD concentration (Figure 1D) across all groups, including EP, EP-VPA, L. dentata oil (EP-LO), and extract (EP-LX), whereas they recorded 13.47 ± 1.60, 15.71 ± 3.61, 15.70 ± 3.54, and 16.29 ± 3.66 U/g. tissue, respectively, comparable with the control group (26.94 ± 2.90 U/g. tissue). Moreover, all diseased or treated groups showed non-significant variations between each other (p > 0.05).The results of the current investigation (Figure 1E) demonstrated that pilocarpine significantly reduced glutathione peroxidase (GPX) to 14.25 ± 2.92 U/g. tissue, as compared to the controls (p > 0.001). Also, there was a significant change (p > 0.001) between the EP-VPA (24.10 ± 2.23 U/g. tissue) and EP groups. Furthermore, compared to EP (14.25 ± 2.92 U/g. tissue), the brain tissues of epileptic rats treated with either L. dentata oil (EP-LO) or extract (EP-LX) demonstrated a considerable increase (p > 0.001) in GPX contents (34.04 ± 3.67 and 35.02 ± 2.92 U/g. tissue, respectively). They almost approached the control level (33.56 ± 3.86 U/g. tissue) with a non-significant difference between the three groups (C, EP-LO, and EP-LX).Evaluation of the inflammatory cytokines (Figure 2) revealed that when compared to the healthy group (C) (217.90 ± 6.96 pg/mg protein tissue), the hippocampal tissue of rats administered pilocarpine showed a significant drop (p > 0.001) in IL-10 cytokine (Figure 2A) (95.90 ± 12.53 pg/mg protein tissue) compared to the EP-VPA group; it was observed that the hippocampus IL-10 content increased significantly (p > 0.05) to 195.10 ± 16.45 pg/mg protein tissue. The results of the present study indicated that the application of Lavandula dentata oil (EP-LO) or extract (EP-LX) via the oral route led to a statistically significant elevation (p > 0.05) in the IL-10 concentrations of hippocampal homogenate tissue (193.80 ± 18.60 and 190.03 ± 8.15 pg/mg protein tissue, respectively). These levels were similar to those observed in the EP of the diseased group (95.90 ± 12.53 pg/mg protein tissue).A pleiotropic cytokine, IL-6, is released in reaction to infections and tissue injury. As illustrated in Figure 2B, the EP group recorded a more considerable significant rise (p < 0.001) in IL-6 (144.60 ± 8.71 pg/mg protein tissue) compared to the control groups, which recorded 36.07 ± 3.62 pg/mg protein tissue. The results of this study demonstrated a significant (p > 0.05) decrease in IL-6 levels in hippocampal homogenate tissue between EP-VPA (58.33 ± 3.50 pg/mg protein tissue) and EP (144.60 ± 8.71 pg/mg protein tissue). The oral treatment with either L. dentata oil (EP-LO) or L. dentata extract (EP-LX) resulted in a significant (p > 0.05) decrease in IL-6 levels, recording 58.20 ± 6.46 and 47.50 ± 11.55 pg/mg protein tissue, respectively, when compared to the non-treated group (EP) (144.60 ± 8.71 pg/mg protein tissue).The IL-17 level in the hippocampal homogenate tissue (Figure 2C) of the non-treated epileptic group (EP) was significantly elevated (p < 0.001) compared to the control group (36.70 ± 6.03 pg/mg protein tissue) (118.37 ± 4.42 pg/mg protein tissue). Conversely, the oral treatment EP-VPA, EP-LO, and EP-LX groups exhibited noticeably reduced IL-17 (p > 0.05) levels of 60.00 ± 5.43, 57.77 ± 4.84, and 66.40 ± 11.34 pg/mg protein tissue, in that order.In comparison to the control groups (30.60 ± 7.78 pg/mg protein tissue), the EP group’s TNF-α recorded a substantial rise (p < 0.05) of 91.40 ± 5.47 pg/mg protein tissue, as shown in Figure 2D. In comparison to the EP group, the current results demonstrated a significant (p > 0.05) decrease in TNF-α level in hippocampus homogenate tissue in EP-VPA (37.57 ± 4.41 pg/mg protein tissue). Furthermore, the oral treatment with either EP-LO or EP-LX ameliorated the level of TNF-α and observed a significant decrease of 32.80 ± 2.72, 38.37 ± 4.15 pg/mg protein tissue (p > 0.05), respectively.The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) was found to be significantly elevated (p > 0.001) by pilocarpine (Figure 2E), recording 210 ± 14.46 pg/mg protein tissue compared to 63.33 ± 8.85 pg/mg protein tissue in the control group. Additionally, the EP group and EP-VPA (98.37 ± 12.58 pg/mg protein tissue) significantly decreased (p > 0.05). Instead, brain tissues from rats with epilepsy that were given L. dentata oil (EP-LO) or extract (EP-LX) showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in TGF-in EP-LO (73.00 ± 12.11 pg/mg protein tissue) and an important (p < 0.05) decrease in EP-LX (78.83 ± 5.42 pg/mg protein tissue). Therefore, both treatments were higher than the protein tissue control level (63.33 ± 8.85 pg/mg).The regulatory T (Treg) cell, mainly in charge of producing suppressive effects, depends on the Fork-head box P3 (FOXP3) protein to control gene expression. This investigation found that the EP group’s FOXP3 gene expression was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.001). As shown in Figure 2F, the mean expression level in the EP group was 6.67 ± 0.55, while it was 1.08 ± 0.14 in the control group. On the other hand, FOXP3 mRNA gene expression was statistically significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in the EP-VPA group, with a mean value of 2.70 ± 0.26. Additionally, FOXP3 expression recorded the lowest level in the EP-LO and EP-LX groups (2.71 ± 0.31 and 2.64 ± 0.41, respectively) (Figure 2F). A confirmational quantification image analysis was performed for the immunohistochemistry staining of Formalin/PFA-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of rat brain tissue staining anti-FOXP3 using antibody CAT # ab75763 with final conc: 1/100, DAB staining (in brown) and hematoxylin QS as a counterstain (in blue). Image analysis of IHC-FOXP3 (Figure 2H) confirmed the re-balance of its gene expression in brain regions, whereas the quantity of the FOXP+-positive cells was increased in epileptic brain regions and recorded 3.83 ± 0.19, 3.60 ± 0.30, and 4.45 ± 0.15 in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, respectively. Significantly, LO and LX treatments showed re-balance (p < 0.0001) in the number of IHC-FOXP3-positive cells in all investigated regions (Figure 2H and Figure 3).Furthermore, the data show that the levels of the messenger RNA (mRNA) for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) (Figure 2G) increased statistically significantly (p < 0.001). It was discovered that the experimental group (EP) had 5.30 ± 0.87 CTLA4 expression, whereas the control group had 1.01 ± 0.01 expression. The gene expression of CTLA4 mRNA was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in the EP-VPA, EP-LO, and EP-LX groups compared to the EP group (5.30 ± 0.87), with values of 2.57 ± 0.41, 2.43 ± 0.31, and 2.07 ± 0.57, respectively.Regarding the light microscope study, the control rats’ cerebral cortex showed a standard histological structure with no significant pathological changes. On the other hand, the cerebral cortex comprises several layers of neuronal cells arranged in microscopic blood veins with no clear borders between them. The nuclei of the neuronal cells were spherical or oval, and surrounded by a sparse layer of basophilic cytoplasm score (0) by prominent nucleoli (Figure 4A,B). In contrast, neuronal degeneration brought on by epilepsy induction was characterized by dark staining and voids between per-cellular haloes. Neuronophagia and gliosis were also seen. Notably, neuronal cell apoptosis manifested as eosinophilic masses linked to steatosis and localized gliosis. The nuclear chromatin of some of these eosinophilic apoptotic entities was noticeably condensed and clumped score (3). Figure 4C,D showed significant perivascular edema and congestion in the cerebral blood vessels with focal hemorrhagic regions.Furthermore, H&E sections of the adult male albino rat treated with VPA in the cerebral cortex revealed neuronal cell degeneration, manifested as shrunken, darkly stained cells with per-cellular haloes. A small amount of neuronophagia, perivascular edema, gliosis, apoptotic bodies, and steatosis was also observed, scoring (2) (Figure 4E,F). Some sections of the cerebral cortex treated with LO exhibited a small number of nuclear pyknosis-associated deteriorated neuronal cells. In addition, perivascular edema, neuronophagia, gliosis, and steatosis were found. There were fewer apoptotic eosinophilic neurons than the group that did not receive treatment. Reduced, condensed, and clumped nuclear chromatin was visible in the red-stained neurons, and oligodendrocytes were present in large numbers around the nuclear chromatin (2) (Figure 4G,H). The administration of LX reduces the various histological changes. The cerebral cortex exhibited standard histological structure with no notable changes, and the neuronal cells had prominent nucleoli and round nuclei surrounded by a sparse layer of basophilic cytoplasm score (0) (Figure 4I,J).The hippocampus slices from the control animals showed layers of compact granular cells with black nuclei, characteristic of their histological structure. In the molecular layer, glial and pyramidal cells were both observable. Upon high-power examination of the hippocampus region, three layers were typically noticeable: the molecular, pyramidal, and polymorphic layers (Figure 5a). In contrast, the hippocampal portions of the EP group showed atrophy, cellular disarray, and a decrease in the number of large pyramidal cells with darker nuclei. Significant vacuolations were also visible in granular cell layers (Figure 5b). After subjecting the cells to VPA treatment, the size of the pyramidal cells shrank, and their nuclei darkened (Figure 5c; H&E ×400). Additionally, hippocampus slices from EP-LO patients showed no pathological alterations in cellular organization, except for a little reduction in pyramidal cell size and darker nuclei (Figure 5d; H&E ×400). Furthermore, EP-LX therapy demonstrated that the hippocampus retained its typical histological configuration of granular cells with black nuclei and the presence of average glial cells and pyramidal cells in the molecular layer (Figure 5e; H&E ×400).Image analysis quantification for histopathological alterations in the cerebral cortex, which revealed variations in all H&E photographs, was analyzed (six fields/rat/group) using the software ImageJ 1.52e.All possible quantifications for the image analysis (Table 4) were done for the studied layers, and the highest average or normal cerebral neurons were recorded in the control group (25.50 ± 2.74). At the same time, EP was significantly reduced (13.333 ± 2.25), likely due to PILO’s negative impact. On the other hand, all treatments modulated and significantly (p < 0.05) recovered the normal cerebral neurons close to the normal count. Enumeration of the degenerative neurons revealed that control of the histopathological section had the lowest count of degenerative cells, while induction of epilepsy caused substantial increases in degeneration. Also, VPA treatments caused a moderate reduction in degeneration level, but LO and LX caused reduced degeneration, nearing the control group.Regarding the thickness of the cerebellum, the control section recorded 48,948.180 mm, while we noticed the EP group by its significantly reduced thickness (38,617.459 ± 1783.434), reflecting damage. EP-VPA, EP-LO, EP-LX: Treatments led to improvement, with EP-LX surpassing the healthy animals. Incremental EP-VPA and EP-LO treatments caused significant (p < 0.05) improvement in the total blood vessel count, while EP-LX showed the most remarkable recovery after severe reduction in the EP group (2.000±). On the other hand, examination of the hippocampal degenerative neurons revealed that the control group had minimal degeneration (4.688 ± 0.522) in comparison to EP, which showed a sharp increase (12.604 ± 1.07), indicating significant (p < 0.05) hippocampal damage. Moreover, all treatments diminished the degeneration levels, with EP-LX returning closer to the control level (6.417 ± 1.4).","The electrical imbalance in the epileptic neuron, Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl− ions were monitored via their quantification in serum and hippocampal tissue during the current investigation. The current findings demonstrated a reduction in Na+ and Ca++ levels in the serum of the epileptic group, accompanied by an increase in K+ and Cl−. The present study’s observations of significant deficiencies in Na+, K+, and hypocalcemia align with the conclusions drawn by Castilla-Guerra, Fernández-Moreno. The hypocalcemia that researchers recorded, and electrolyte gradients across cell membranes, may contribute to significant neurological damage by influencing neuronal discharge and promoting epileptogenesis behavior, directly or indirectly. Unlike in the epileptic hippocampal tissue, Na+ and Ca++ levels showed an elevation.In contrast, the levels of K+ and Cl− were shown to be lowered in comparison to the control group. Similar findings were reported by Raimondo, Burman, who found that epileptiform activity is linked to a peak decrease in extracellular Na+ and a rise in intracellular Na+ concentration. In the hippocampus tissue, there was a drop in K+ and an increase in Na+ due to the low-active ATPase enzyme and the low-active Na+/K+ pump.On the other hand, Abdel-Reheim, Ahmed observed hypokalemia and hypernatremia in the serum of rats with epilepsy. The Na+-K+ ATPase pump is less effective when potassium contents are lowered, and corresponding neuronal hyperpolarization occurs. Inhibiting the pump results in intracellular potassium loss, neuronal depolarization, and initially spontaneous discharge. In the brain, electrochemical signaling is mediated by an electrochemical gradient. The Na+/K+ pump is an active transporter that transfers ATP hydrolysis energy. Ions traverse the neuronal membrane against concentration gradients and have activities related to potential action creation and maintaining other active transport mechanisms and cell volume regulation. In this instance of human TLE, insufficient spatial potassium buffering by astrocytes causes glial cells and neurons to depolarize more and for more extended periods in response to activity-dependent potassium release, which may be a factor in the development of seizures.When Cl− accumulates intracellularly, passive redistribution is useless. Furthermore, because Cl−K+ co-transport depends on the K+ gradient, it loses some effectiveness during seizures. The efficiency of Cl−K+ co-transport is dependent on numerous metabolic pathways and can be influenced by hypoxia or ischemia. Alterations in the extracellular ion concentrations, reductions in GABAergic function, increases in synaptic excitation, or modifications in both K+ and Ca++ currents may result from alterations in the ionic microenvironment surrounding the epileptic foci. These events all contribute to the protracted depolarization. The precise mechanism by which seizures cease remains unknown; however, they may stop when inhibitory circuits in the neuronal network become active or when the ionic environment changes, such as decreased extracellular K+, intracellular Ca++ elimination, or glutamate release.Heteromeric proteins called voltage-gated ion channels produce and transmit action potentials in brain neuronal cells. They are membrane-associated proteins that carry ion currents into the cell along their concentration gradient. Genes linked to these channel genes are the most often occurring cause of hereditary epilepsies. In this study, the ionic channels protein indicated high levels of Na+ and Ca++ gates while K+ was decreased. SCNN1a is a voltage-gated sodium channel subunit present in the soma and dendrites of mammals. It is the most common of all the voltage-gated sodium channels, and the most frequently implicated mutation is in it. Because SCN1A is needed for neurons to fire and spread action potentials, the genes that code for this channel are thought to play a significant role in epilepsy. Voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channels in dendritic cells also support action potentials in cortical pyramidal cells.In the current study, the pilocarpine-treated rats observed an elevated level of NMDA (glutamate receptor) and a low level of CLCNC (GABA receptor). The extensive release of glutamate in susceptible areas after pilocarpine injection leads to the activation of NMDA glutamate receptors and neuronal damage through oxidation and apoptosis after Ca++ influx. Conversely, dendritic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are the primary mediators of the Na+ influx. Therefore, any rises in intracellular Na+ occur after the high levels of neuronal activity and NMDAR activation that cause epileptic seizures. Similarly, intracellular Na+ accumulations lower the Na+ driving force at glutamatergic receptors, shrinking excitatory postsynaptic currents. Excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitters damages cells by activating voltage-activated Ca++ channels and NMDA receptors, which let Ca++ into the cell. A series of metabolic alterations brought on by Ca++ and other ionic changes ultimately lead to cell death.Moreover, the present study noticed neurotransmitter and electrolyte imbalance, recording the status of gate modification and cytokines variations. These changes were recorded with low levels of GABA and acetylcholine-esterase but high levels of glutamate, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in the seizure-active pilocarpine epileptic rats. These events came in accordance with previous observations. Pilocarpine administered intraperitoneally induces a significant increase in glutamate, which is vital in the maintenance and development of seizures. According to a recent study, limonene, a cyclic monoterpene component of L. dentata, can interact with GABAA receptors and have an anxiolytic effect by boosting GABA concentration in the brain. The observed antiepileptic activity of Lavandula spp. may be due to its potency to decrease the sodium current and increase the potassium current and its inhibitory effect of GABA because of its contents of Linalool, which has an inhibitory impact through gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA-A) receptors. This effect reduces anxiety and downregulates limbic system activity.The high dopamine (DA) level in the present epileptic rats was recorded by Cifelli and Grace in rodent animal models of TLE. These findings also imply that DA level fluctuations modify DA’s neuromodulatory function on limbic system brain circuits. However, Werner and Coveñas outlined how GABA hypoactivity can produce dopamine hyperactivity and how DA increase is caused by dopaminergic neurons being impacted by the GABAergic system’s inhibitory action through GABAA receptors. The present results are parallel to those of Li, Wang, who confirmed that LEO of Lavandula angustifolia reduced dopamine levels, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and substance P. Moreover, different investigations have demonstrated that some aromatherapy constituents can inhibit 5-HT and dopamine receptors that are linked to the sensation of nausea.The fact that oxidative stress is more likely to happen in the brain shows how important it is to understand how oxidative stress leads to seizures. When rats were given pilocarpine, their lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide activity levels were much higher than those in the control group. However, their levels of superoxide dismutase activity were not significantly higher. They also had significantly lower levels of catalase and glutathione activity. Sudha, Rao reported high amounts of MDA in the red blood cells of epileptic patients, which matched the results of the current study. Lipid peroxidation and epileptic activity have also been linked in animal models.According to some reports, phytoflavonoids and coumarins found in natural goods can help with a few neurological problems because they are potent antioxidants. Most secondary plant chemicals are thought to stop seizures by changing how ions move through ligand- or voltage-gated ion channels. They can connect with the voltage-gated sodium ion (Na+) channels or the benzodiazepine site of the g-amino butyric acid (GABA) A receptors, among other things. The current data approved that L. dentata could attach to NMDA glutamate receptors and stop them from sending signals. So, other researchers thought that L. dentata might help neurons avoid damage caused by glutamate by either blocking this glutamate-activated ionotropic receptor or calcium channels. L. dentata oil has been demonstrated to effectively develop spatial learning deficits in Alzheimer’s patients, significantly improving performance and generating neuroprotection in patients with focal cerebral ischemia. One of the main ingredients in L. dentata oil, Linalool, has been demonstrated in experiments to reduce glutamate binding in rats.The present results came parallel with others, which revealed that L. dentata oil distinguishably altered the desensitization and deactivation phases of AMPA subunits’ kinetics. As a result, a relationship has been established between AMPA receptors and several neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric illnesses. Consequently, the present investigation employed an electrophysiologic methodology to examine the impacts of L. dentata oil. Glutamate functions as a pharmaceutical target to reduce anxiety and epilepsy, and its effects are facilitated through the AMPA receptor. To discover any modulatory activity, the oil of L. dentata was assessed by three separate AMPA receptor characteristics: peak current, desensitization, and deactivation.Examining the possible biological effects of essential oils (Eos), especially on AMPA receptors in the central nervous system, was fascinating. L. dentata oil has a calming effect that may be partly explained by its inhibitory effect on glutamate receptors. L. dentata can either block the glutamate-activated ionotropic receptor or its calcium channel-blocking activity or induce neuroprotection in focal cerebral ischemia because it binds to NMDA glutamate receptors with affinity and exhibits inhibitory activity at those receptors to protect against glutamate-induced toxicity. Furthermore, lavender extract’s antioxidant qualities and calcium channel blockage contribute to its neuroprotective effects. Thus, suppressing glutamate release, NMDA receptors, and/or calcium channel blockage appears to mediate the antiepileptic effect of Lavender sp.According to newly available data, flavonoids may help prevent neurological diseases by modulating γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction, and controlling antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mediators like superoxide dismutase (GSH), cytokines, and glutathione (GSH). The active oil and extract ingredients, Linalool, alpha-pinene, thymoquinone, and terpinene-4-ol, can bind to the GABAA receptor at the benzodiazepine site or raise GABA activity.The observed low cholinergic activity after treatment with L. dentata may be due to cyano-carvone inhibiting lipid peroxidation and nitrite production. Therefore, there is a synchronous correlation between behavioral modification and the anticonvulsant action. Cyano-carvone consequently lengthens the latency periods before the onset of initial seizures and the establishment of status epilepticus. Cyano-carvone has also been demonstrated to counteract the behavioral alterations that are brought about by pilocarpine.In addition to other primary ingredients that can account for several positive benefits, such as polyphenols, the sound effects of Lavender sp. in traditional medicine have traditionally been attributed to essential oils in the plant. According to Comalada, Ballester, Comalada, Camuesco, flavonoids are polyphenols with antioxidant and immunomodulatory qualities that directly influence the anti-inflammatory effects seen in experimental models of colitis. Dietary flavonoids are recognized for their ability to trigger cytoprotective proteins and to interact with various neurotransmitter systems that may be implicated in neuroprotection, such as dopamine, glycine, GABA, and adenosine.L. dentata extracts have recently demonstrated immunomodulatory qualities in vitro while downregulating various inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide and cytokines. These actions were linked to the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and many inducible enzymes, including MMP-9, iNOS, and COX-2, all implicated in maintaining the inflammatory state. In the DPPH Assay, the L. dentata extracts exhibited comparable antiradical activity. Additionally, after receiving either L. dentata, the depletion of the colonic glutathione level was partially prevented in control colitic rats.Moreover, NMDA receptors are antagonistic towards monoterpene elements of L. dentata, such as α-pinene, citronellal, and myrcene. Most essential oils are made up of terpenes, which are in some way responsible for the pharmacological actions of the medicinal plant, including its antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and anticonvulsant properties. Among the monoterpenes, alpha-pinenes are a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and have a stimulating impact on GABAA receptors and boost postsynaptic GABA-dependent chloride fluxes. The DAEO monoterpenes citronellal, citronellol, myrcene, and β-pinene can also block NMDA receptors and shield neurons from excessive stimulation. A significant reduction in striatal dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) levels and hippocampal nitrite was observed following administration of α-pinene and an equimolar mixture of the two monoterpenes. The results of this study indicate that the potential anticonvulsant effects of β-pinene could be attributed to a reduction in the levels of the two neurotransmitters involved.L. dentata contains borneol, which could increase GABA activity and shield neurons from harm during epileptic convulsions. Previous research has demonstrated that borneol has anti-hyperalgesic effects on neuropathic and inflammatory pain by lowering mechanical hyperalgesia and enhancing GABAAR-mediated GABAergic transmission in the spinal cord. Borneol can suppress GABA and glycine transmission in the substantia gelatinosa neurons of the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis. Furthermore, it directly affects postsynaptic substantia gelatinosa neurons and mediates the glycine and GABAA receptors’ activation to cause substantia gelatinosa neurons to elicit inward currents repeatedly.Furthermore, because of its hydrocarbon skeleton, which is thought to be a hydrophobic ligand that might aid in interacting with the hydrophobic active site of AChE, limonene is also reported to have anti-AChE activity. Additionally, limonene can raise glutathione (GSH), catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and other oxidative stress indicators such as protein carbonyls and malondialdehyde (MDA) while decreasing others. Moreover, limonene was found to efficiently increase the IL-10/IL-2 ratio, which in turn increases the levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor that inhibits the production of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines.Additionally, research on Linalool, a monoterpene alcohol and one of the main ingredients of L. dentata oil, showed that it might prevent rats from binding glutamate. Linalool has been shown to enhance GABAA function in mammalian electrophysiology studies. Furthermore, compounds derived from Linalool and its metabolites, including Linalool oxide, linalyl acetate, 8-oxo linalyl acetate, 8-carboxy linalyl acetate, and 8-oxo Linalool, have been observed to influence GABAA activity and have anticonvulsive properties. Furthermore, lavender extracts’ antioxidant qualities and calcium channel blockage may contribute to their documented neuroprotective benefits. Thus, suppressing glutamate release, NMDA receptors, and/or calcium channel blockage appears to mediate the antiepileptic effect of Lavender sp. One of the essential oils of lavender, Linalool, has been shown in human embryonic kidney cells to inhibit T-type calcium channels. As a result, it may attenuate cellular excitability by lowering intracellular calcium and providing additional protection against calcium toxicity during seizure episodes.Epilepsy may be a progressive disease by positing that it affects multiple brain regions simultaneously but to varying degrees. In addition to improving memory impairment, valproate (VPA) and phenytoin (PHT) have been proven to raise synapse-related gene mRNA expression, and protein levels also showed that epilepsy increases the risk of generating dementia and memory impairment. Hence, LEO can potentially produce an antiemetic impact by suppressing receptors associated with 5-HT and obstructing the subsequent Ca2+/CaMKII/ERK1/2 pathway of the cAMP signaling pathway.The recorded effector molecules, such as TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and oxygen-free radicals like reactive oxygen species, are continuously secreted by microglia that are activated by recurrent seizures. These molecules can harm other neurons, glial cells, and the blood–brain barrier, causing local or extensive damage to the central nervous system, leading to epilepsy, and inducing seizures. The current study’s high levels of inflammatory cytokines caused by epileptogenic pilocarpine are in line with the results of earlier investigations. In the epileptic group, the current study identified an increase in IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, TGF-β, FOXP3, and CTLA-4 and a reduction in IL-10. Previous research has established the correlation between local blood–brain barrier breakdown and TGF-β signaling in glia and local inflammation of the cerebral cortex microenvironment. Other studies have demonstrated this correlation by activating a TGF-β receptor-mediated signaling cascade in glia, which subsequently induces local inflammation. The current study suggested the inhibitory activity of the monoterpene p-cymene, which reduced TBARS formation, indicating a protective antioxidant effect. It is imperative to acknowledge that p-cymene exhibits two potential antioxidant reactions: the generation of lipid radicals and the synthesis of nitrite radicals. This is attributed to the compound possessing two locations containing benzylic hydrogens. Consistent with earlier studies, p-cymene is highly effective in preventing the production of reactive species from nitrogen, which is thought to have a neuroprotective effect.In addition, L. dentata’s active ingredient, borneol, can raise GSH, SOD, and CAT levels simultaneously, demonstrating a protective effect against oxidative stress brought on by PTZ. Furthermore, by lowering the degree of DNA damage, borneol treatment decreased the genotoxicity of H2O2 in both testicular cells and hepatocytes in vivo. Furthermore, borneol reduces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the neurons in the rats’ cerebral cortex, promoting neuroprotection by decreasing the expression and activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and preventing neuronal death. The borneol content of L. dentata can inhibit oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in astrocytes by decreasing the level of GFAP in the brain, which decreases LPO and raises the levels of SOD, GSH, and CAT. As a terpene derivative, borneol can also improve the ultrastructure of neurons by lowering the apoptotic index and intracellular calcium levels in both the brain and the hippocampus. Borneol can lower the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and TNF expression in the hypothalamus to reduce [Ca2+] overload and protect neurons in different paths from dying.Another L. dentata’s thymol—a natural phenolic monoterpenoid, from p-Cymene, the same isomer as carvacrol—has been proposed to be a neuroprotective component in cortical rat neurons against oxidative stress caused by H2O2. In vitro, thymol has been demonstrated to exhibit antioxidant capabilities, and a high capacity for hydroxyl radical elimination. Thymol can raise the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, as well as antioxidant enzymes like SOD, GPx, CAT, and GST. Thymol treatment, which increases GSH levels, lowers lipid peroxidation, and lowers blood MDA levels, can dramatically lessen the neurotoxic effects of amyloid on rat hippocampal neurons.Recently, it was reported that some flavonoids like quercetin could lessen seizures and neuronal death via lowering astrocytic activation, according to a study on the anti-inflammatory effect of flavonoids in experimentally generated epileptic convulsions. This suggests flavonoids provide neuroprotection during seizures by modulating inflammatory responses and their antioxidant effects. Moreover, Lippia multiflora’s plant was recorded with dual antiepileptic and anti-inflammatory qualities and linked to a significant decrease in seizure frequency and intensity. This implies that oxidative stress and inflammation, two critical elements in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, can be successfully addressed by herbal extracts.Moreover, Azimi, Rahmati have demonstrated that the administration of lavender has the effect of delaying the emergence of status epilepticus, reducing its length, and decreasing the associated death rate. The cells exposed to Lavandula dentata extract exhibited elevated levels of glutathione, a crucial element in bolstering cellular defenses against oxidative stress. The recent literature confirms that the antioxidant compounds in L. dentata exhibited vigorous antioxidant activity with an IC50 value of 16.41 ± 0.11 µg/mL in the DPPH radical scavenging assay. Therefore, L. dentata can help mitigate the effects of reduced GPx activity by enhancing overall antioxidant defenses in the body. Also, these chemical contents of L. dentata act as additional sources of antioxidants and, therefore, can potentially compensate for the decreased levels and functions of GPx function, i.e., reducing oxidative stress levels. Another study highlights that flavonoids can enhance antioxidant defenses by modifying enzymes like glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, suppress inflammatory mediators, and disrupt inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g., NF-κB, MAPK). Both oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are essential factors in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, and this combined action may help reduce them. In addition, the flavonoids of Ganoderma lucidum have antiepileptic effects through anti-inflammatory processes, such as blocking the production of NF-κB in the brain. Possible antioxidant effects accompany this decrease in neuroinflammation, indicating that the extract may have dual protective benefits against seizures by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress.Furthermore, carvacrol, an active ingredient of the monoterpenoid phenol, has been shown to decrease the production of IFN-g, IL-6, and IL-17, partly by regulating auto-reactive Th1 and Th17 cells. Furthermore, carvacrol inhibits severe leukocyte influx into the CNS by decreasing inflammatory cytokines implicated in the local production of chemokines and adhesion molecules.Vieira, de Oliveira predicted that the epileptic individuals’ cells would exhibit an activated profile compared to controls due to earlier research showing elevated levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or mediators, indicating chronic low-grade peripheral inflammation in TLE. In instances of epileptogenesis, elevated inflammatory cytokine levels can break down the blood–brain barrier, allowing diverse immune components to interact with one another freely. The abnormal neuronal hyper-excitability resulting from these inflammatory mediators’ production will increase the permeability of glutamatergic neurons to calcium ions. The authors examined two waves of inflammatory mediators and cytokines from neurons or glial cells, which can intensify downstream cascades of inflammation and cause neuronal hyper-excitation during epileptogenesis.Adult brain cells express a variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-15, and several chemokines, including CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4. These have been reviewed by Lee, Nagai, and Wang, Wang. While many studies—Sinha, Patil Mao, Ding; Pernhorst, Herms; Sonmez, Serin —have identified a correlation between IL-4, IL-8, and IL-17 levels and seizure frequency and severity, other studies have not found an association between these parameters. Finally, Wang, Wang found that in three distinct types of epilepsy, namely temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), extra-temporal lobe epilepsy (XLE), and idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), only four independent cytokine biomarkers (IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-17-a, and IFN-λ3) are correlated with severe seizures.Moreover, the present data assumes that there is a correlation between oxidative stress markers and IL-17 in epilepsy, highlighting the potential of therapeutic strategies of using L. dentata oils or extracts targeting inflammation and oxidative damage. Postulated anti-inflammatory therapies of the current herbal treatment aimed at reducing oxidative stress may contribute to lowering atherosclerosis, while antioxidants targeting IL-17 may reduce oxidative stress and can reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. Recently, many studies showed that high levels of IL-17 can increase oxidative stress by activating inflammatory pathways that increase ROS production; for example, IL-17 can stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. This bidirectional relationship with IL-17 increases brain tissue’s recorded oxidative stress response. Also, IL-17 promotes oxidative stress through inflammatory mechanisms, and ROS can also increase IL-17 expression, indicating a feedback loop that exacerbates neuroinflammation and oxidative damage during epileptic events.The recorded attenuation of the inflammatory cytokines may be due to the presence of borneol, one of the terpene derivatives in the extract or oil of L. dentata. By inhibiting p-p65 and p38 signal transduction, borneol protects neurons and microglia from inflammatory activity by reducing LPS-induced inflammation, decreasing TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 levels in the brain, and increasing IL-10. Regarding the assessment of intracellular cytokine production, the present study identified a rise in IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-17. This finding aligns with prior research that documented increased cytokine concentrations in lymphocytes and monocytes, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and serum/plasma during the interictal period, specifically following seizures, in patients with TLE and other epileptic syndromes. Furthermore, IL-10’s neuroprotection, cell survival, and anti-inflammatory properties are linked to its ability to protect the central nervous system from various proapoptotic factors created during immune response activation. The effects of IL-10 on cell death include blocking initiator and effector molecules, preventing TNF-α-induced cell death in astrocytes, reducing cerebellar neuron death through NMDA receptor-induced excitotoxicity, inhibiting mitochondrial-induced cell death in excitotoxicity, inhibiting mitochondrial-induced cell death in microglia, and, lastly, blocking the cascade of apoptosis. Elevated concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) have been observed in the plasma during the interictal phase of epilepsy, whereas IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 did not rise in comparison to a healthy group.Conversely, Foxp3 expression must remain constant in mature Treg cells for them to continue acting as suppressors. Foxp3 in glial cells has been demonstrated to serve a protective role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Foxp3 plays a neuroprotective effect in these cells by downregulating TLR4 signaling, which involves NMDA receptor deactivation to lessen neuronal death. Treg formation and function regulators like Foxp3 can impact the ratio of anti-inflammatory Tregs to pro-inflammatory Th17 cells.The observed neuroprotective action of L. dentata to restore the histopathological alterations—recently, carnosol content of Lavander spp.—could prevent cell death in dopamine neuron cells and increase the production of tyrosine hydroxylase. This effect is achieved by activating the Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway. The more significant cognitive functions, such as memory creation and consolidation, are thought to be primarily mediated by the hippocampus. Hippocampal cell loss is shown histologically in the CA1, CA3, and dentata hilus, following a pattern like that of patients with mesial temporal sclerosis and persistent temporal lobe epilepsy. According to Bui, Nguyen, the present investigation revealed that in rats with chronic epilepsy, there was a notable reduction in the activation of mossy cells. These cells are glutamatergic populations located in the hilum of the hippocampal dentata gyrus (DG). These drops alone hindered spatial contextual processing and resulted in memory impairments. Also, the hippocampus is a part of the brain that can cause seizures and is easily damaged by them. Therefore, hippocampal sclerosis frequently manifests as a neuropathological characteristic of epilepsy. The occurrence of this phenomenon is observed in around 30 to 45% of all epileptic syndromes, with a higher prevalence of 56%, specifically in the case of MTLE, as reported by Thom in 2014. Hippocampal sclerosis is the prevailing pathological condition associated with drug-resistant epilepsy in the elderly population.Collectively, image analysis and enumeration of different inflamed areas showed that the EP group had significant damage across all metrics, indicating the adverse effects of the experimental condition. In contrast, EP-VPA had moderate recovery across metrics, suggesting the treatment is partially effective, and L. dentata extract showed more pronounced recovery, with EP_LX (higher dose) consistently outperforming L. dentata’s oil. Therefore, the experimental induction of epilepsy severely impacts brain health, causing reduced neuron and glial cell counts, increased degeneration, and structural damage. At the same time, L. dentata’s oil treatment improves outcomes, with treatment with L. dentata’s extract being the most effective, nearing or exceeding control levels in some metrics.","Lavandula dentata enhances the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as GSH, SOD, and CAT, protecting against oxidative stress generated by PTZ. L. dentata could reduce inflammatory cytokines’ effects and protect neurons and microglia against inflammation. Currently, no research specifically investigates the impact of L. dentata oil and ethanol extracts on FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in a rat model of epilepsy. However, the available data suggests that L. dentata’s oil and extract may benefit by restoring the balance between pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and anti-inflammatory Treg cells, including those expressing Foxp3. Therefore, based on the current study’s findings, the practical applications of Lavandula dentata extracts include their integration into therapeutic regimens, neuroprotective supplement use, and the development of phytopharmaceuticals. These extracts could enhance seizure control and mitigate cognitive side effects if used alongside standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to enhance seizure control while mitigating cognitive side effects often associated with AEDs. Moreover, Lavandula dentata supplementation could also be used as a natural way to support brain health in individuals with seizures or neurodegenerative conditions."
61,TA003702,10.1155/2012/342652,In Vitro Cytotoxic Potential of Essential Oils of Eucalyptus benthamii and ItsRelated Terpenes on Tumor Cell Lines.,"Eucalyptus L. is traditionally used for many medicinal purposes. In particular,some Eucalyptus species have currently shown cytotoxic properties. LocalBrazilian communities have used leaves of E. benthamii as a herbal remedy forvarious diseases, including cancer. Considering the lack of available data forsupporting this cytotoxic effect, the goal of this paper was to study the invitro cytotoxic potential of the essential oils from young and adult leaves of E.benthamii and some related terpenes (α-pinene, terpinen-4-ol, and γ-terpinene) onJurkat, J774A.1 and HeLa cells lines. Regarding the cytotoxic activity based onMTT assay, the essential oils showed improved results than α-pinene andγ-terpinene, particularly for Jurkat and HeLa cell lines. Terpinen-4-ol revealeda cytotoxic effect against Jurkat cells similar to that observed for volatileoils. The results of LDH activity indicated that cytotoxic activity of samplesagainst Jurkat cells probably involved cell death by apoptosis. The decrease ofcell DNA content was demonstrated due to inhibition of Jurkat cells proliferationby samples as a result of cytotoxicity. In general, the essential oils from youngand adult leaves of E. benthamii presented cytotoxicity against the investigatedtumor cell lines which confirms their antitumor potential.","Döll-Boscardin, Patrícia Mathias, Sartoratto, Adilson, Sales Maia, Beatriz Helena Lameiro de Noronha, Padilha de Paula, Josiane, Nakashima, Tomoe, Farago, Paulo Vitor, Kanunfre, Carla Cristine",2012,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2,True,True,True,"['head **[REVIEW ARTICLE](http://www.frontiersin.org/Microbiology/editorialboard)** [published: 25 January 2012](http://www.frontiersin.org/Microbiology/editorialboard) [doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00012](http://www.frontiersin.org/Microbiology/editorialboard) ![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg) ', 'essential oils in food preservation: mode of action, [synergies, and interactions with food matrix components](http://www.frontiersin.org/antimicrobials,_resistance_and_chemotherapy/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00012/abstract) ', '**introduction** Essential oils are aromatic and volatile liquids extracted from plant material, such as flowers, roots, bark, leaves, seeds, peel, fruits, wood, and whole plant [\\(Deans and Ritchie, 1987](#page-20-0); [Hammer et al.,](#page-21-0) [1999;](#page-21-0) [Sánchez et al., 2010](#page-22-0)). Essential oils have been used for centuries in medicine, perfumery, cosmetic, and have been added to foods as part of spices or herbs. Their initial application was in medicine, but in the nineteenth century their use as aroma and flavor ingredients increased and became their major employment. Almost 3000 different essential oils are known, and 300 are used commercially in the flavor and fragrances market [\\(Burt, 2004](#page-19-0)). Essential oils are considered to be secondary metabolites and important for plant defense as they often possess antimicrobial properties [\\(Fraenkel](#page-21-0), [1959](#page-21-0); [Tajkarimi et al.](#page-23-0), [2010\\)](#page-23-0). The antibacterial properties of secondary metabolites were first evaluated using essential oil vapors by De la Croix in 1881 [\\(Burt](#page-19-0), [2004](#page-19-0)).

Although the food industry primarily uses essential oils as flavorings, they represent an interesting source of natural antimicrobials for food preservation. However, application of essential oils as food preservatives requires detailed knowledge about their properties, i.e., the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the range of target organisms, the mode of action, and the effect of food matrix components on their antimicrobial properties. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of current knowledge about the antimicrobial mode of action of essential oil constituents, and to identify research avenues that can facilitate implementation of essential oil constituents as natural food preservatives in foods. ']","['**experimental approaches to investigate the antimicrobial mode of action** The diversity of essential oil constituents is enormous and presents a wide range of compounds. Some have low or no efficiency against microorganisms while others are potent antimicrobials. The majority of antimicrobial compounds found in essential oils are terpenoids and phenylpropenes with the most active being phenols, although some aldehydes and non-phenolic substances also present promising antimicrobial activity. The target site and mode of action of most essential oil components is still not well understood, especially in yeast. Commercial applications of essential oils would benefit from deeper insight into the mode of action behind individual compounds, as this could facilitate the exploitation of, e.g., synergistic combinations with more powerful antimicrobial properties. Many different techniques have been applied to elucidate the mode of action of essential oils and their constituents. Here we will present and discuss the most common experimental approaches. After establishing the killing or inhibition activity of a compound, an array of experiments can be performed to identify how a compound interacts with the cell to cause the observed effects. In this context, it is important to distinguish between experiments that identify the target site from those that elucidate the mode of action. The site of action refers to the part of the cell which interacts with the compound, e.g., the cell membrane, cell wall, or intracellular proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, or metabolites. The mode of action, however, yields more elaborate knowledge about the molecular mechanisms or intermolecular interactions behind the inhibition or killing effects. An overview of methods addressing the site or mode of action of antimicrobial compounds is provided in **[Table 3](#page-15-0)**. ', '**locating the site of action** High-resolution microscopy, such as electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy (AFM), can reveal the most extreme consequences of exposure to an antimicrobial compound, i.e., deformation of cells occurring from lysis or from damages to the cell wall. An advantage of TEM is that ultra-thin cross sections can reveal ultrastructural changes in the interior of the cell. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AFM only image the cell surface. AFM has one important advantage over electron microscopy, in that it allows measurements in liquid under physiological conditions, avoiding difficult sample preparation and the artifacts associated herewith [\\(Alessandrini and Facci](#page-19-0), [2005](#page-19-0)). A limitation of both AFM and electron microscopy is, however, that specific cellular structures must be identified according to morphology unless some form of labeling can be applied. While antibodies conjugated to metal nanoparticles have been used with TEM in a few studies [\\(Romero et al., 2010\\)](#page-22-0), no labeling techniques have been reported for SEM and AFM. It is, however, possible to combine AFM with optical microscopy and thus take advantage of the numerous options for fluorescent labeling of biomolecules. An important site of action is the cell membrane, and indeed, many essential oil constituents have been proposed to act on the bacterial membrane. Interaction of antimicrobial compounds with the membrane can affect the transport of nutrients and ions, the membrane potential, and the overall permeability of the cell. These effects are investigated by measuring the efflux of intracellular ions like K+ and H+ [\\(Ultee et al., 1999](#page-23-0); [Lambert et al.,](#page-21-0) [2001\\)](#page-21-0). Efflux of small ions is not necessarily indicative of complete loss of membrane function, and can be observed in viable cells where growth is inhibited because the cell uses energy for repair or survival rather than cell proliferation [\\(Bouhdid et al.,](#page-19-0) [2010\\)](#page-19-0). Effects on the cell membrane that lead to cell death is more accurately predicted by detecting the efflux of larger molecules like ATP or carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cFDA) after esterase reaction [\\(Xu et al., 2008](#page-23-0)), or by influx of large polar organic DNA-binding stains like ethidium bromide [\\(Lambert et al.](#page-21-0), [2001\\)](#page-21-0) and propidium iodide [\\(Bouhdid et al.](#page-19-0), [2010](#page-19-0)). It should be pointed out that it is always good practice to validate the observed effects by combining several techniques. Monitoring the release of calcein encapsulated in membrane vesicles can for example be used as a complimentary tech[nique to confirm the membrane as the site of action \\(](#page-22-0)Miron et al., [2000\\)](#page-22-0). If no effects are observed on cell structure and membrane functionality, it is assumed that the site of action is intracellular. The target can be proteins and enzymes in general, or it can be essential cellular processes involved in biosynthesis or energy generation. An intracellular site of action can for example be determined by incorporation of radioactively labeled substrates used in particular biosynthesis pathways [\\(Schneider et al.](#page-23-0), [2010\\)](#page-23-0). Lack of or decreased incorporation is then taken as an indication of the process being affected by the antimicrobial compound. For example, radiolabeled nucleotides or amino acids can be used to detect if DNA replication or protein synthesis takes place, respectively [\\(Schneider et al.](#page-23-0), [2010\\)](#page-23-0). Some compounds have multiple sites of action, and in that case it can be difficult to pinpoint which one is ultimately responsible for cell death. For example, a compound that affects membrane permeability will also affect the membrane potential and thereby energy generation by respiration. It is thus difficult to distinguish direct effects on energy-generating processes from the indirect effect a permeable membrane has on these processes. At sublethal concentrations, changes to the transcriptome and proteome during exposure can reveal how the cell responds to the compound, and upregulation of genes involved in certain metabolic or biosynthesis pathways can be indicative of which cell structures or processes that are affected [\\(Burt et al., 2007](#page-19-0); [Rao et al., 2010\\)](#page-22-0). ', '**elucidating the mode of action** The probably most comprehensive approach to investigate the mode of action of a particular compound is to perform random transposon mutagenesis in order to search for mutations that compensate for the antimicrobial effect of a particular compound. In this way, it is possible to identify the mode of action of compounds that interact very specifically with, e.g., a single enzyme or with par[ticular proteins or lipids in the membrane \\(](#page-23-0)Shapira and Mimran, [2007;](#page-23-0) [Van Hoang et al., 2011](#page-23-0)). The approach is, however, not suited for investigating antimicrobial compounds that act simultaneously on several components in the cell, as a single mutation is unlikely to facilitate compensation for the antimicrobial effect on the cell as a whole. Antimicrobial compounds that act on the membrane can cause depolarization or increased permeability through various mechanisms. For example, some antimicrobial peptides form pores [\\(Cotter et al., 2005](#page-20-0); [Fantner et al., 2010](#page-20-0)) while other compounds, such as certain essential oil constituents, have a fluidifying effect on the membrane [\\(Trombetta et al.](#page-23-0), [2005;](#page-23-0) [Cristani et al., 2007](#page-20-0)). Membrane properties like lipid packing can be investigated in membrane vesicles by LAURDAN staining combined with spectrofluorometry [\\(Nielsen and Otzen, 2010](#page-22-0)), and membrane fluidity can be investigated directly in bacteria by differential scanning calorimetry [\\(Trombetta et al., 2005\\)](#page-23-0) or fluorescence anisotropy measurements of DPH using a spectrofluorometer [\\(Liao et al.,](#page-21-0) [2010\\)](#page-21-0). AFM imaging has also in recent years allowed highresolution visualization of native membranes on a solid support. Structural changes resulting from integration of an antimicrobial compound into the membrane can thus be visualized directly [\\(Brasseur et al.](#page-19-0), [2008](#page-19-0)), and the effect on membrane rigidity can be quantified by AFM force spectroscopy [\\(Sullan et al.](#page-23-0), [2010](#page-23-0)). Functionalizing the AFM tip with the antimicrobial compound of interest furthermore allows investigation of interaction forces between the compound and its target. This approach wasfor example used to map binding events of vancomycin on the surface of bacteria and confirmed that binding occurred at the site of cell wall synthesis in dividing cells [\\(Gilbert et al.](#page-21-0), [2007\\)](#page-21-0).

Successful control of food-borne pathogens requires the use of multiple preservation techniques in the manufacturing and storage of food products. A recent consumer trend toward preference for products with lower salt and sugar content presents an increased need for efficient food preservatives, as lowering the salt and sugar content would otherwise compromise the product's shelf-life [\\(Zink](#page-23-0), [1997](#page-23-0)). A wide range of preservatives are used to extend the shelf-life of a product by inhibiting microbial growth. However, an increasingly negative consumer perception of synthetic food additives has spurred an interest in finding natural alternatives to the traditional solutions [\\(Zink, 1997\\)](#page-23-0). Although originally added to change or improve taste, the antimicrobial activity of essential oils makes them an attractive choice for substituting synthetic preservatives.

The interest in essential oils and their application in food preservation has been amplified in recent years by an increasingly negative consumer perception of synthetic preservatives. Furthermore, food-borne diseases are a growing public health problem worldwide, calling for more effective preservation strategies. The antibacterial properties of essential oils and their constituents have been documented extensively. Pioneering work has also elucidated the mode of action of a few essential oil constituents, but detailed knowledge about most of the compounds' mode of action is still lacking. This knowledge is particularly important to predict their effect on different microorganisms, how they interact with food matrix components, and how they work in combination with other antimicrobial compounds. The main obstacle for using essential oil constituents as food preservatives is that they are most often not potent enough as single components, and they cause negative organoleptic effects when added in sufficient amounts to provide an antimicrobial effect. Exploiting synergies between several compounds has been suggested as a solution to this problem. However, little is known about which interactions lead to synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects. Such knowledge could contribute to design of new and more potent antimicrobial blends, and to understand the interplay between the constituents of crude essential oils. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of current knowledge about the antibacterial properties and antibacterial mode of action of essential oils and their constituents, and to identify research avenues that can facilitate implementation of essential oils as natural preservatives in foods. **Keywords: antimicrobial, mode of action, synergy, terpenes, terpenoids, phenylpropenes, carvacrol, thymol** ""]","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['**essential oils in food preservation** Food-borne diseases are a growing public health problem worldwide.

The registered flavorings are, e.g., linalool, thymol, eugenol, carvone, cinnamaldehyde, vanillin, carva[crol, citral,](#page-21-0) and limonene, all of which are considered to present no risk to the health of the consumer. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also classifies these substances as generally recognized as safe (GRAS). The crude essential oils classified as GRAS by FDA include amongst others clove, oregano, thyme, nutmeg, basil, mustard, and cinnamon. There are regulatory limitations on the accepted daily intake of essential oils or essential oil components, so before they can be used in food products, a daily intake survey should be available for evaluation by FDA. Despite the demonstrated potential of essential oils and their constituents*in vitro*, their use as preservatives infood has been limited because high concentrations are needed to achieve sufficient antimicrobial activity. In many food products, the hydrophobic essential oil constituents are impaired by interactions with food matrix components, such as fat [\\(Cava-Roda et al.](#page-20-0)[,](#page-22-0) [2010](#page-20-0)[;](#page-22-0) Rattanachaikunsopon and Phumkhachorn, [2010](#page-22-0)), starch (Gutierrez et al., [2008\\)](#page-21-0), and proteins [\\(Cerrutti and Alzamora](#page-20-0), [1996](#page-20-0); [Kyung,](#page-21-0) [2011\\)](#page-21-0). Furthermore, the antimicrobial potency of essential oil constituents also depends on pH [\\(Juven et al.](#page-21-0), [1994](#page-21-0)), temperature [\\(Rattanachaikunsopon and Phumkhachorn](#page-22-0),[2010\\)](#page-22-0), and the level of microbial contamination [\\(Somolinos et al.](#page-23-0), [2010](#page-23-0)). Extrapolation of results from *in vitro* tests to food products is thus difficult at best, and a lower performance of the antimicrobial compound must be expected. For example, Cilantro oil had significant antibacterial activity at 0.018% *in vitro*, but when applied to a ham model, even 6% cilantro oil had no antimicrobial activity [\\(Gill et al.,](#page-21-0) [2002\\)](#page-21-0). Before being added to food products, it is therefore useful to investigate how essential oils or their constituents interact with food components *in vitro*. Food matrix interactions with the essential oils or their constituents can be investigated by measuring the growth of microorganisms in culture medium containing a range of concentrations of fat, protein, or starch as well as the antimicrobial compound of interest. Such experiments have been performed using a so-called food model media [\\(Gutierrez et al.,](#page-21-0) [2009\\)](#page-21-0), and can be used to provide quick answers to which kind of food products the compound in question can be used in. The intense aroma of essential oils, even low concentrations, can cause negative organoleptic effects exceeding the threshold acceptable to consumers [\\(Lv et al., 2011\\)](#page-22-0). Having to increase the concentration of essential oils to compensate for their interactions with food matrix components is therefore highly unfortunate and limits their application to spicy foods where the acceptable sensory threshold is relatively high. Different strategies can be used to circumvent this problem. One option is to use essential oils in active packaging rather than as an ingredient in the product itself. Essential oils can be encapsulated in polymers of edible and biodegradable coatings or sachets that provide a slow release to the food surface or to the headspace of packages of, e.g., fruit, meat, and fish [\\(Pelissari et al., 2009](#page-22-0); [Sánchez-González et al.,](#page-22-0) [2011\\)](#page-22-0). Sachets that release volatile essential oils into the headspace environment are simply placed within an enclosed food package [\\(Ahvenainen, 2003\\)](#page-19-0). The advantage of incorporating volatile components of essential oils in films or edible coatings is that the diffusion rate of the agents away from the food product can be reduced, thereby maintaining the active compounds in the headspace or on the [product surface for extended periods of time \\(](#page-22-0)Phillips and Laird, [2011;](#page-22-0) [Sánchez-González et al.](#page-22-0), [2011\\)](#page-22-0). A way to minimize organoleptic effects of essential oils added to the matrix of a food product is to encapsulate essential oils into nanoemulsions. This approach increases the stability of volatile components, protecting them from interacting with the food matrix, and increases the antimicrobial activity due to increased passive cellular uptake [\\(Donsí et al., 2011](#page-20-0)). Lowering the concentration of essential oils without compromising their antimicrobial activity can also be obtained by applying them in combination with other antimicrobial compounds that provide a synergistic effect [\\(Nguefack et al., 2012](#page-22-0)). Synergies are known to occur for essential oil combinations, and it is therefore a field with countless opportunities to find potent antimicrobial blends, which may be the key to implementing essential oils in food preservation without simultaneous organoleptic effects. ', '**synergies between essential oil components** The interaction between antimicrobials in a combination can have three different outcomes, synergistic, additive, or antagonistic. Synergy occurs when a blend of two antimicrobial compounds has an antimicrobial activity that is greater than the sum of the individual components. An additive effect is obtained when the combination of antimicrobials has a combined effect equal to the sum of the individual compounds. Antagonism occurs when a blend of antimicrobial compounds has a combined effect less than when applied separately [\\(Davidson and Parish, 1989](#page-20-0); [Burt, 2004](#page-19-0)). The combined effect of a blend is analyzed by using measurements of the MIC to calculate the fractional inhibition concentration index (FICIndex) according to the formulas defined by [\\(Davidson and Parish, 1989](#page-20-0)): FICA = MICA+B/MICA, FICB = MICB+A/MICB, FICIndex = FICA + FICB. The MICA+<sup>B</sup> value is the MIC of compound A in the presence of compound B, and vice versa for MICB+A. Calculating the FIC value for either substance A or B then requires determination of the MIC for the individual components. Theoretically, a FICIndex near 1 indicates additive interactions, while below 1 implicates synergy, and above 1 antagonism [\\(Davidson and Parish, 1989](#page-20-0)). However, this definition has been replaced by a more general one where the FICIndex results are interpreted as synergistic if FICIndex < 0.5, additive if 0.5 < FICIndex < 4, or antagonistic if FICIndex > 4 [\\(Odds](#page-22-0), [2003\\)](#page-22-0). The antimicrobial activity of a given essential oil may depend on only one or two of the major constituents that make up the oil. However, increasing amounts of evidence indicate that the inherent activity of essential oils may not rely exclusively on the ratio in which the main active constituents are present, but also interactions between these and minor constituents in the oils. Various synergistic antimicrobial activities have been reported for constituents or fractions of essential oils when tested in binary or ternary combinations [\\(Delaquis et al., 2002;](#page-20-0) [Pei et al.](#page-22-0), [2009;](#page-22-0) [García-García et al., 2011;](#page-21-0) [Nguefack et al., 2012](#page-22-0)). For example, [García-García et al.](#page-21-0) [\\(2011\\)](#page-21-0) found the most synergistic binary combination against *L. innocua* to be carvacrol and thymol, and the most active ternary combination to be carvacrol, thymol, and eugenol. Reports on greater antimicrobial activity of crude essential oils compared to blends of their major individual components suggests that trace components in the crude essential oils are critical to the activity and may have a synergistic effect [\\(Marino et al., 2001](#page-22-0); [Delaquis et al., 2002](#page-20-0)[;](#page-21-0) [Burt](#page-19-0), [2004](#page-19-0); Koutsoudaki et al., [2005](#page-21-0)). In contrast to this, trace components may also cause antagonistic interactions, which were seen by comparing the antimicrobial effect of pure carvacrol to oregano oil where carvacrol is a major constituent. Pure carvacrol was 1500 times more effective than the crude essential oil [\\(Rao et al., 2010](#page-22-0)). Among individual essential oil constituents, synergy has been observed for carvacrol and *p*-cymene on *B. cereus* [\\(Ultee et al.,](#page-23-0) [2002;](#page-23-0)[Rattanachaikunsopon and Phumkhachorn,2010](#page-22-0)). It appears that *p*-cymene swells bacterial cell membranes, probably enabling easier entrance of carvacrol into the cell membrane where it exerts its action [\\(Ultee et al., 2002\\)](#page-23-0). Furthermore, [Bassolé et al.](#page-19-0) [\\(2010](#page-19-0)) showed that if linalool or menthol was combined with eugenol it showed the highest synergy, suggesting that a monoterpenoid phenol combined with a monoterpenoid alcohol is an effective combination. Little is currently known about what governs synergy and antagonism among essential oil constituents. Four theoretical mechanisms of antimicrobial interactions produce synergy: (i) sequential inhibition several steps in a particular biochemical pathway, (ii) inhibition of enzymes that degrade of excrete antimicrobials, (iii) interaction of several antimicrobials with the cell wall, or (iv) interaction with the cell wall or membrane that leads to increased uptake of other antimicrobials [\\(Davidson and Parish,](#page-20-0) [1989;](#page-20-0) [Eliopoulos et al., 1996\\)](#page-20-0). Another possibility for synergistic effects could be that antimicrobials have different mode of actions, thereby attacking two different sites on or in the cell, which indirectly depend on each other. Even less is known about the cause antagonism, it is hypothesized to occur when: (i) combining bacteriostatic and bactericidal antimicrobials, (ii) antimicrobials have the same site of action, (iii) antimicrobials interact with each other [\\(Davidson and Parish](#page-20-0), [1989\\)](#page-20-0), Larson (1985) in [Roller](#page-22-0) [\\(2003](#page-22-0)). The hypothesized synergistic or antagonistic interactions are based on 15 year old results, and with the emergence of new techniques this field is likely to see some significant advances in our understanding of how antimicrobial compounds affect each other when acting in concert. In practice, the knowledge needed to exploit synergistic combinations of essential oils in food products is (i) the site and mode of action of each essential oil constituent, and (ii) the mechanisms resulting in synergy or antagonism between several compounds, and (iii) how each compound interacts with food matrix components in a way that affects is antimicrobial properties. When the mechanistic details for synergistic interactions are better understood, it will be easier to exploit synergies using intelligent combinations of constituents to combat food spoilage microorganisms. ', '**outlook** An attractive application of essential oils and their constituents is in food products to prolong the shelf-life of foods by limiting growth or survival of microorganisms. The organoleptic impact of essential oils and their components in food products currently limits their usage to spicy foods normally associated with herbs, spices, or seasonings. Synergistic interactions should therefore be <span id=""page-19-0""></span>exploited to lower the organoleptic impact and thereby facilitate the use in a broader range of products. The lack of detailed knowledge about the mode of action of the individual essential oil constituents is also the underlying cause for our superficial understanding about what governs synergy and antagonism. Future research should thus explore the mode of action of individual essential oil constituents further, while also initiating systematic investigations into the mechanisms of synergy among different constituents. Many studies have investigated the site of action, while few proceed to reveal the mode of action. Furthermore, most work to date has focused on prokaryotes, and little is known about how essential oils interact with yeast and fungi. Regardless of the microorganism, future research into the mode of action will need a standardization of investigation methods, complementary experiments that validate results, and implementation of new techniques. Taking a systems biology approach to investigating the mode of action of antimicrobial compounds will no doubt further this field.

62,TA042665,10.1186/s13071-022-05158-1,Molecular and functional characterization of a conserved odorant receptor fromAedes albopictus.,"BACKGROUND: The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is a competent vector ofseveral viral arboviruses including yellow fever, dengue fever, and chikungunya.Several vital mosquito behaviors (e.g., feeding, host-seeking, mating, andoviposition) are primarily dependent on the olfactory system for semiochemicalsdetection and discrimination. However, the limited number of studies hampers ourunderstanding of the relationships between the Ae. albopictus olfactory systemand the complex chemical world. METHODS: We performed RT-qPCR assay on antennaeof Ae. albopictus mosquitoes of different sexes, ages and physiological states,and found odorant receptor 11 (AalbOr11) enriched in non-blood-fed femalemosquitoes. Then, we examined the odorant preference with a panel ofphysiologically and behaviorally relevant odorants in Xenopus oocytes. RESULTS:The results indicated that AalbOr11 could be activated by ten aromatics, seventerpenes, six heterocyclics, and three alcohols. Furthermore, using post-RNAinterference (RNAi) hand-in-cage assay, we found that reducing the transcriptlevel of AalbOr11 affected the repellency activity mediated by (+)-fenchone at alower concentration (0.01% v/v). CONCLUSIONS: Using in vitro functionalcharacterization, we found that AalbOr11 was a broadly tuned receptor. Moreover,we found that AalbOr11 shared a conserved odorant reception profile withhomologous Anopheles gambiae Or11. In addition, RNAi and bioassay suggested thatAablOr11 might be one of the receptors mediating (+)-fenchone repellencyactivity. Our study attempted to link odor-induced behaviors to odorant receptionand may lay the foundation for identifying active semiochemicals for monitoringor controlling mosquito populations.","Yan, Ru, Xu, Zhanyi, Qian, Jiali, Zhou, Qiaoling, Wu, Huiming, Liu, Yahui, Guo, Yirong, Zhu, Guonian, Chen, Mengli",2022,Parasites & vectors,2,True,True,True,"Female Aedes albopictus is a vector for viral pathogens causing human diseases including yellow fever, dengue fever, and chikungunya. Due to strong ecological plasticity and a wide range of biting hosts, it is implicated in outbreaks of these diseases in areas where their primary vector, Aedes aegypti, is absent or outnumbered by Ae. albopictus. These arboviral diseases carried by Ae. albopictus are increasingly becoming a global health concern. Many interventions against these vector-borne diseases have long relied on reducing mosquito populations. Besides insecticides, odor-baited traps which depend on the mosquito olfactory system are a major strategy. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationships between the Ae. albopictus olfactory system and odorants might provide important information for developing active semiochemicals for monitoring or controlling populations.The olfactory system is essential for mosquitoes, since vital behaviors such as finding carbohydrate sources, hosts for blood meals, and oviposition sites and avoiding predators are dependent primarily on its detection of blends of volatile molecules from the complex chemical world. As two major olfactory organs, antennae and maxillary palps both contain many hair-like sensilla, which house olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) for detecting odorants. In most instances, two (up to four) OSNs coexist in one sensillum, and each OSN expresses one odorant receptor protein. The function of odorant receptors (Ors) requires co-expression with a highly conserved receptor (known as Orco). The Or-Orco complex that is formed is a ligand-gated heterodimeric cation channel that can open directly upon activation by an appropriate ligand.Mosquitoes possess various numbers of the Or family, varying from 18 (Anopheles darlingi) to 180 (Culex quinquefasciatus). As one model for studying olfactory chemosensing, all Ors of Anopheles gambiae have been identified and the majority has been deorphanized, which means that corresponding ligands of Ors have been found. In comparison to An. gambiae, Ae. albopictus has extremely different behaviors, such as daytime biting and oviposition sites in containers, which may explain the difference in their odorant reception to different chemical stimuli. However, only several Ors of Aedes have been defined; for example, AaegOr4 is considered to be the key receptor for distinguishing humans from other animals, and AalbOr2 and AalbOr10 respond strongly to indole and skatole from oviposition sites. Due to the low homology of odorant receptors among different insect species, most odorant receptors in Aedes are still ""orphan receptors"" (no corresponding ligands have been found), which hampers our understanding of its olfactory system.According to previous RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, we found that non-blood-fed (NBF) female mosquitoes possessed higher transcript levels of AalbOr11 than males (unpublished). In addition, the alignment of amino acid sequences indicated that Or11 was conserved among three major disease-transmitting vectors: Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Such conserved and female-biased odorant receptors as Or11 should be significant for the olfactory system in mosquitoes; thus, we deorphanized AalbOr11 in Xenopus oocytes by a panel of odorants with physiologically and behaviorally relevant compounds, including human-related odorants, oviposition attractants, and plant repellents. The expression profiles of AalbOr11 among different sexes, ages, and physiological states were investigated. The expression and functional profiles suggested that AalbOr11 might be involved in mosquito host-seeking. Furthermore, we used a strong ligand of AalbOr11, (+)-fenchone, as the subject to explain the mechanism of odorant-induced behavior.","The colony of Ae. albopictus used in this study was kindly provided by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China. The colony was originated from a population collected from Sichuan, China, and has been maintained in insectary for 15 years without exposure to any insecticides. Mosquitoes were maintained at 27 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 10% relative humidity (RH), with a photoperiod of 14:10 (light/dark).To assess the relative transcript abundance of AalbOr11 in different sexes and ages, gene expression assays were conducted using the antennae of male and non blood-fed female mosquitoes at 1, 3, and 5 days post-eclosion (dpe). In addition, the mosquitoes were collected at 1 h, 48 h, and 96 h after blood-feeding to identify the effects of the blood-feeding behavior on relative transcript abundance of AalbOr11. After the mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized, their antennae were cut off with dissecting scissors and immediately placed in RNAlater-ICE (Ambion, Austin, TX) on ice prior to RNA extraction. The total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) and isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, 1 μg of total RNA was used as template for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis by reverse transcription using a PrimeScript™ RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa Bio, Otsu, Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions.The expression profile of AalbOr11 was determined using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). β-actin was used as the housekeeping gene (primer sequence: Actin-qF:GCTACGTCGCCCTGCACTT; Actin-qR: AGGAACGACGGCTGGAAGA), and qPCR was performed using a TB Green Premix Ex Taq II Kit (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan). Each 20 μL qPCR reaction mixture consisted of 10 μL 2× TB Green Premix Ex Taq II mix (Tli RNase H Plus), 0.8 μL of each primer (10 μM), 2 μL diluted cDNA template, 0.4 μL ROX Reference Dye II (50X), and 6 μL sterilized deionized water. The primers were as follows: AalbOr11-qF: 5′-ATGCAGCTCAAAGACGAAT-3′; AalbOr11-qR: 5′-AGCAGAATCCATAGTACT -3′. The qPCR was conducted on a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 34 s. The reproducibility was validated by including three technical replicates and three biological replicates for each reaction. Acquisitive data were analyzed with the 2−ΔΔCt method.Gene-specific primers were designed based on coding sequences of putative AalbOr11 (XM_029861619.1) and identified AalbOrco (AALF000221/XM_029877254.1). PCR was performed using the following gene-specific primers containing Kozak motif (GCCACC): AalbOr11 F: GCCACCATGCAGCTCAAAGACGAATGGAT; AalbOr11R: TTAGCCGGCAGCTTGCTTCAGGA; AalbOrco F: GCCACCATGAACGTCCAGCCGACAAAGTA; AalbOrco R: TTATTTCAACTGCACCAACACCA. Subsequently, PCR products through sequencing validation were subcloned into pT7TS vector with the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (TaKaRa Bio, Otsu, Japan). The capped RNA (cRNA) was prepared from linearized vectors and purified by mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mature healthy oocytes (stage V–VII) were isolated from female Xenopus laevis frog ovarian lobes using standard procedures as described previously. Oocytes treatment and purified cRNA microinjection were consistent with those described previously. Each oocyte was injected with 27.6 nL of AalbOr11 and AalbOrco cRNA at a 1:1 ratio. Post-injection, oocytes were kept at 18 °C for 3–7 days in incubation buffer (1× Ringer’s solution supplemented with 5% dialyzed horse serum, 50 μg/mL tetracycline, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 550 μg/mL sodium pyruvate).Odorant stock solutions were prepared at 10–1 M with DMSO. Odorant-induced current at a holding potential of –80 mV was recorded from the injected Xenopus oocytes using a two-electrode voltage-clamp setup (RC-3Z/OC-725D, Warner Instruments). Data acquisition and analysis were carried out with an Axon Digidata 1550B and pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, CA). Information regarding odorants used in electrophysiological recordings is provided in Additional file 2: Table S1.The genes of interest (GOI) were amplified using gene-specific primers that included T7 promoter sequences (underlined), AalbOr11-F: TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGACGACGTTTACGACAATCCG, AalbOr11-R: TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATCCCAGAAAATCGCCTTCT; EGFP-F: TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCACAAGTTCAGCGTGTCCG, EGFP-R: TAATACG.

PCR products were amplified with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA), and the PCR procedure was conducted with the following settings: 98 °C for 30 s, 35 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 10 s, followed by a final 10 min extension step at 72 °C. The purified and sequenced PCR fragments were used as the template for synthesizing dsRNA of AalbO11 and EGFP. The dsRNA molecules were synthesized using the TranscriptAid T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Three-day-old female mosquitoes were collected and placed on a clean CO2 pad to be anesthetized. The anesthetized mosquitoes were lined up on the side for injection, and 1000 ng of dsRNAs in 0.5 μL volume was injected into one side of the thorax with a PLI-100 injector (World Precision Instruments). Post-injection, mosquitoes were put in new cages and supplied with sugar water (10% wt/vol). Males (ratio 1:1) were released into the cage for mating.The hand-in-cage assay method used was identical to that described previously. Forty 4- to 9-day-old females (mated, non blood-fed) were transferred to a 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm mosquito cage for 24 h prior to assay and were provided only with water in a cotton ball. Each compound dissolved in 500 µL acetone was evenly applied to a piece of nylon netting (mesh size 0.5 mm, 7 cm × 6 cm) and dried in air for 5 min. A window (6 cm × 5 cm) was cut out in a nitrile glove, and a set of magnetic window frames was assembled and put on a modified glove. The magnetic window frames contained one piece of magnetic frame, one treated net, three magnetic frames, one untreated net, and one magnetic frame from bottom to top. In this case, mosquitoes were attracted to skin emanations from the hand through the open window but were unable to contact treated nets with tarsi. The assay was performed at a temperature of around 28 °C and around 50% RH. The assay was video-recorded for 5 min, and the number landing on the test window and trying to pierce the skin was counted from the second to fifth minutes. For each cage, control (acetone) was tested before treatment, and the control with a high landing number was used to test compounds after 1 h to allow mosquitoes to fully recover and residual vapors from experiments to dissipate. Percentage repellency was determined using the following equation: Percentage repellency = [1 − (cumulative number of mosquitoes on the window of treatment from 2 to 5 min / cumulative number of mosquitoes on the window of solvent treatment for from 2 to 5 min)] × 100.All data generated in this study are presented within this published article.Not applicable.Not applicable.","We performed RT-qPCR assay on Ae. albopictus to identify the transcript level of AalbOr11 in mosquitoes of different sexes, ages, and physiological states. The transcription level of AalbOr11 in females was significantly higher than that in males among 1 dpe (P = 0.0021), 3 dpe (P = 0.0000001), and 5 dpe (P = 0.00005) mosquitoes (Fig. 1a). The expression level of AalbOr11 in female mosquitoes exhibited a stark change between 1 and 5 dpe (P = 0.0059; Fig. 1b), as well as between 3 and 5 dpe (P = 0.0012; Fig. 1b). To further define the function of AalbOr11 in odor-induced behavior, we analyzed the dynamic changes in different physiological states in female mosquitoes, including non blood-fed mosquitoes at 1 dpe, 3 dpe, and 5 dpe (termed NBF-1, NBF-3, NBF-5) and blood-fed mosquitoes at 1 h, 48 h, and 96 h (termed BF-1, BF-48, BF-96). The transcript level of AalbOr11 in BF-1 or BF-48 mosquitoes was significantly lower than that in NBF-5 samples (PBF-1 = 0.0038; PBF-48 = 0.0033, Fig. 1b). However, there was no significant difference in AalbOr11 abundance between NBF and BF-96 mosquitoes (P = 0.1252, Fig. 1b).We co-expressed AalbOr11 along with AalbOrco in Xenopus oocytes for deorphanization. A panel of odorants including human-related odorants, oviposition attractants, and plant repellents was used to identify the ligands of AalbOr11. According to chemical structures, 126 odorants were classified into 11 major chemical categories: terpenes, alcohols, esters, aromatics, heterocyclics, acids, aldehydes, ketones, amines, lactones, and compounds from pyrethrum. A high dosage (10–4 M), was used as the preliminary screening concentration. A total of 26 odorants elicited currents on AalbOr11/AalbOrco, of which the currents induced by seven odorants were greater than 300 nA. The seven strong ligands comprised two terpenes (+)-fenchone and (−)-fenchone, and five aromatics 3-methylindole, 2-ethyltoluene, indole, acetophenone, and 2-ethylphenol (Fig. 2a, b). In order to identify whether AalbOr11 was a specialist or a generalist, Or tuning curves were generated (Fig. 2c). As shown in Fig. 2c, AalbOr11 responded to 26 chemically diverse odorants, and could be classified as a generalist.Subsequently, we performed dose–response analyses for the best ligands to obtain more information about the sensitivity of the AalbOr11 receptor. In consideration of the similar structure of indole and 3-methylindole, indole was replaced with 2-acetylthiophene to conduct concentration gradient assay. Since these six ligands could elicit greater current at 10–3 M doses, we conducted concentration–response analyses in a range from 10–3 to 10–6 M. The strongest ligand, (+)-fenchone, elicited robust mean current (~ up to 1500 nA) at a dose of 10–3 M, whereas at a dose of 5 × 10–6 M, (+)-fenchone only induced current to 10 nA, which activated AalbOr11/AalbOrco at half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 139.5 μM. Another compound, 2-ethyltoluene, which belongs to the aromatics, elicited lower responses at a dose of 10–3 M; however, its EC50 was 62.19 μM, thus representing the most sensitive ligand (Fig. 3).To further link odorant, behavior with the receptor, we used a strong ligand of AalbOr11, (+)-fenchone, as the subject to investigate odorant-induced behavior. Our hand-in-cage assay showed that (+)-fenchone elicited repellency in Ae. albopictus which was comparable to that of positive control DEET when at the 10–2 dilution (Fig. 4b). We conducted RNA interference (RNAi) experiments to assess whether reducing the transcript level of AalbOr11 would affect repellent activity. AalbOr11-dsRNA-treated mosquitoes had a lower abundance of AalbOr11 than mosquitoes injected with EGFP-dsRNA (P = 0.000012, Student’s unpaired two-tailed t-test), and the knockdown effect of AalbOr11 was maintained for at least 5 days (Fig. 4a). Then 2-day mosquitoes after dsRNA injection were used to compare repellent activity with hand-in-cage assay. We used three doses of (+)-fenchone (0.01%, 0.1%, 1%) to examine repellency, and used 1% doses of DEET as the positive control. At lower doses (0.01%), protection elicited by (+)-fenchone decreased significantly (n = 8, P = 0.0273) (Fig. 4b). Moreover, at a higher dose (0.1%), (+)-fenchone-induced protection was lower in AalbOr11-dsRNA-treated than in EGFP-dsRNA-treated mosquitoes, but the difference was not significant (n = 6–7, Student’s unpaired t-test, P = 0.1300) (Fig. 4b). By contrast, repellency elicited by the highest dose (1%) of (+)-fenchone was not significantly different between AalbOr11-dsRNA-treated and EGFP-dsRNA-treated mosquitoes, which was consistent with DEET repellency (n = 4, Student’s unpaired t-test, P > 0.999) (Fig. 4b).","Age-, sex-, and feeding state-dependent transcript level changes in odorant receptors have been found in other mosquitoes, such as Ae. aegypti, Anopheles coluzzii, and An. gambiae, which might result from their olfactory system modulation, so that mosquitoes can rapidly respond to chemical stimuli at the right moment. In this study, we found that female mosquitoes possessed higher transcript levels of AalbOr11 than males. Furthermore, the abundance of AalbOr11 in female mosquitoes reached its peak at 5 days post-emergence, and decreased significantly after blood-feeding. The phenomenon of blood meal-induced reduction in transcript levels of Ors has also been found in other mosquitoes, such as AgamOr46/47/48 and AaegOr116. Our results indicate that AalbOr11 may be involved in blood-meal-seeking behavior. A previous study revealed that Or gene expression in Ae. aegypti antennae might contribute to human preference, and the differentially expressed Or4 responded to sulcatone, a human odorant, to discriminate human and non-human animals. Our electrophysiological results also indicated that AalbOr11 was sensitive to human odor, such as indole, 3-methylindole, and methyl-2-methylbenzoate, which suggests that preference for human odor in mosquitoes is tightly linked to increases in expression.In the ongoing evolution of mosquito species, Or11 is conserved among three major disease-transmitting vectors: Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes. AalbOr11 shared 58.39%, 58.49%, and 69.5% overall sequence identity with Or11 of An. gambiae, An. coluzzii, and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively. Or11 of Ae. aegypti, another mosquito species belonging to the subfamily Aedes, was up to 93.57% identical to AalbOr11 (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The high homology of Or11 among three major disease-transmitting mosquito genera suggests it may play a crucial role in many behavioral contexts. We wondered whether its odorant reception profile was consistent with OR11 of An. gambiae. According to deorphanized results, we found that AalbOr11 was a broad-tuned receptor, which could be activated by ten aromatics, seven terpenes, six heterocyclics, and three alcohols. All ligands were consistent with AgOr11 except eugenol, which could activate AalbOr11 but could not activate AgOr11. Thus, Or11 homology was functionally conserved in different mosquito species, which was similar to that described previously in Or2 homology in Ae. albopictus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and An. gambiae. In addition, the EC50 of the strongest ligand was 62.19 μM, far from nanomolar or picomolar concentration, suggesting that the truly strongest ligand of AalbOr11 was not found or that it is a broad-tuned but not sensitive receptor.The strong ligand of AalbOr11, (+)-fenchone, has been found to confer repellency to several insects, including Aedes aegypti, Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila suzukii, and Prostephanus truncates. Similarly, repellent activity of (+)-fenchone against Ae. albopictus was found in this study. Hence we performed RNAi experiments to attempt to link odorant reception with repellent activity. The results showed that reducing the transcript level of AalbOr11 affected the repellent activity mediated by a lower concentration of (+)-fenchone (0.01% v/v). In addition, reduced protection was observed with knockdown mosquitoes at a higher concentration (0.1%), although it was not statistically significant. On one hand, (+)-fenchone-elicited repellency might involve multiple Ors of Ae. albopictus. On the other hand, RNAi treatment reduced transcript levels by only c. 80%, and the remaining AalbOr11 still played a significant role in (+)-fenchone-mediated repellent activity. The possible link between reception and behavior has also been found in Cx. quinquefasciatus. The significant reduction in protection in CquiOr4-dsRNA-treated mosquitoes suggests it may play a significant part in 2-phenylethanol-mediated repellent activity. RNAi and bioassay suggested that AablOr11 may be one of the receptors mediating (+)-fenchone repellency.","We found that AalbOr11 was highly conserved among three major disease-transmitting vectors and was enriched in non blood-fed female mosquitoes. According to in vitro functional characterization, AalbOr11 was a broadly tuned receptor. In addition, RNAi and bioassay suggested that AablOr11 may be one of the receptors mediating (+)-fenchone repellent activity. Our study provides further information regarding the mechanisms of olfactory-mediated mosquito behavior (e.g., host-seeking and repellent activity), and also provides new insight into active semiochemical identification for monitoring or controlling mosquito populations."

In the major crop plants,next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are intensely applied to exploitgenetic resources, to develop genomic resources and to enhance breeding. Here,genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) has been used in the non-model medicinal plantchamomile to evaluate the genetic structure of the cultivatedvarieties/populations, and to perform genome wide association study (GWAS)focusing on genes with large effect on flowering time and the medicinallyimportant alpha-bisabolol content. RESULTS: GBS analysis allowed theidentification of 6495 high-quality SNP-markers in our panel of 91 M. recutitaplants from 33 origins (2-4 genotypes each) and 4 M. discoidea plants asoutgroup, grown in the greenhouse in Gatersleben, Germany. M. recutita proved tobe clearly distinct from the outgroup, as was demonstrated by different clusterand principal coordinate analyses using the SNP-markers. Chamomile genotypes fromthe same origin were mostly genetically similar. Model-based cluster analysisrevealed one large group of tetraploid genotypes with low genetic differentiationincluding 39 plants from 14 origins. Tetraploids tended to display lower geneticdiversity than diploids, probably reflecting their origin by artificialpolyploidisation from only a limited set of genetic backgrounds. Analyses offlowering time demonstrated that diploids generally flowered earlier thantetraploids, and the analysis of alpha-bisabolol identified several tetraploidgenotypes with a high content. GWAS identified highly significant (P < 0.01) SNPsfor flowering time (9) and alpha-bisabolol (71). One sequence harbouring SNPsassociated with flowering time was described to play a role in self-pollinationin Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas four sequences harbouring SNPs associated withalpha-bisabolol were identified to be involved in plant biotic and abiotic stressresponse in various plants species. CONCLUSIONS: The first genomic resource forfuture applications to enhance breeding in chamomile was created, andanalyses ofdiversity will facilitate the exploitation of these genetic resources. The GWASdata pave the way for future research towards the genetics underlying importanttraits in chamomile, the identification of marker-trait associations, anddevelopment of reliable markers for practical breeding.","Otto, Lars-Gernot, Mondal, Prodyut, Brassac, Jonathan, Preiss, Susanne, Degenhardt, Jörg, He, Sang, Reif, Jochen Christoph, Sharbel, Timothy Francis",2017,BMC genomics,2,False,False,True,"German Chamomile (Matricaria recutita L. syn. Chamomilla recutita (L.) Rauschert; from hereon chamomile) is described to be native to the Near East and South-Southeast Europe and is grown in many temperate regions of the world. As already mentioned by Hippocrates (fifth century BC,), it has a long history of use in herbal medicine, with applications in gastrointestinal diseases, treatment of infections and inflammatory diseases of the skin, and respiratory problems. The flower heads contain medicinal compounds, and are either used dried (e.g. tea) or the essential oils are extracted. Chamomile has numerous secondary metabolites which are medicinally active, including the terpenes alpha-bisabolol (syn. Levomenol) and its derivates (bisaboloids), matricine/chamazulene, further terpenes, and several flavonoids.Chamomile is mainly outcrossing, and as most chamomile varieties are rather landraces, they display a high degree of phenotypic variability reflecting that of natural populations, from which they were isolated. Whereas wild populations of chamomile are diploid, agronomically cultivated varieties are either diploid or artificially generated tetraploid, the latter of which have larger flower heads and higher 1000-seed weight. Genetic diversity in chamomile was evaluated in a few studies using a variety of different genetic markers (summarized in), including AFLP, RAPD and ISSR. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches have been successfully used for the analysis and exploitation of genetic and genomic resources in crop plant breeding, including rapeseed, soybean, barley, or maize, e.g.. One NGS approach, genotyping by sequencing (GBS), has been widely used in many crop plants (e.g.), is highly reproducible and reduces genome complexity with restriction enzymes, thus, lowering costs. In contrast, the use of NGS / GBS for the amelioration of medicinal and aromatic plant breeding is relatively underexploited. An NGS approach has not yet been described for the non-model plant species chamomile.In our work, we applied GBS to a set of chamomile origins (varieties, populations, accessions) to identify genome-wide, high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to estimate genetic diversity and to reveal genetic structure within our cultivated chamomile germplasm collection. Therefore this is the first study reporting the generation and use of SNP markers in chamomile. We furthermore phenotyped the plants for flowering time (FT) and the content of bisaboloids by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Using phenotyping and genotyping data, an association study was performed to identify SNPs associated with FT and bisaboloids content, and to search for possible candidate genes underlying FT and the production of the medicinally-important compound alpha-bisabolol. In comparison to other marker platforms like AFLP or RAPD, the high marker density of genome-wide SNPs generated by GBS increases the probability of identifying markers closely linked to genes of interest. The resulting data provide a basis to enhance breeding in chamomile.","Ninety one genotypes, representing 2–4 genotypes each from 33 origins of M. recutita L., and an additional 4 genotypes from 2 M. discoidea DC accessions as outgroup, were included in the analysis (Table 1). The focus of the study on cultivated chamomile, mainly encompassing origins from all over Europe, but also including some locations outside of Europe. For the purpose of this study, we define an origin as either a registered variety, a gene bank accession, a cultivated or wild population of chamomile. The term population applies to a wild natural population as well as to a cultivated one selected for breeding or agriculture. Genotype refers to a genetically individual plant.Seeds were sown in the greenhouse on the 16th July 2014, and seedlings were individually transplanted into single pots (14 cm diameter) after reaching the 20-leaf stage. Between 2 to 4 genotypes per origin were selected for the subsequent analysis, with a focus on elite varieties/populations (4 genotypes each). Plant ploidy was determined by flow-cytometry according to Otto et al. at the 10- to 20-leaf stage.Plants were randomized in the greenhouse, organized in a block of plants of 6 × 16 plants, and grown until the 31st of January 2015 under natural light conditions (short day conditions, with day / night temperatures of 17–21 °C (12 h) / 14–19 °C (12 h)) and from February 2015 until the end of April 2015 under additional light for 16 h (long day conditions, MASTER Agro 400 W E40 1SL Na-bulb lamp, 2000 K colour temperature, Royal Philips N.V. Netherlands) with day / night temperatures of 18–21 °C (12 h) / 15–17 °C (12 h). Flowering time (FT) was measured as days after sowing (DAS).The content (peak areas) of bisaboloids (terpenoids), namely bisabolol oxide B, bisabolon oxide A, alpha-bisabolol, and bisabolol oxide A, were analysed by gas chromatography for 80 samples (76 from M. recutita and 4 from M. discoidea). The content of the chemical compounds was determined for each genotype in a sample of pooled flower heads, where flower heads were harvested after the first 2 circles of florets started flowering, scored as the flowering time until maximum half of the florets were flowering. All plants were grown and processed equally. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further analysis to prevent the oxidation of alpha-bisabolol.The analysis by GC-MS was done with modifications according to Köllner et al. and Irmisch et al.. For each sample, the finely ground powder on liquid nitrogen of 80 to 100 mg material from 5 flower heads was used. For each pulverized sample 200–400 μl of n-hexane was added, followed by overnight incubation with shaking at 25 °C. A total of 100 μl was transferred to a clean microtube fitted for GC vials. Terpene analysis was carried out with a gas chromatograph (GC 2010, Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) equipped with a splitless injector (injector temperature, 220 °C; injection volume, 1 μl) and coupled to a quadrupole mass selective detector (Shimadzu). H2 was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1. Samples were analysed on a Supreme-5 ms column (30 m length × 0.25 mm inner diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness, Chromatographie Service GmbH, Germany). The coupled mass spectrometer was operated with a transfer line temperature of 230 °C, a source temperature of 230 °C, a quadrupole temperature of 150 °C, an ionization potential of 70 eV and a scan range of 50–350 amu.A flame ionization detector (FID) was used for the quantification of the compounds (μg/g of fresh weight), and operated at 250 °C. Compounds were identified by comparison of retention times and mass spectra to those of authentic reference substances obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), or by reference spectra in the Wiley and Shimadzu libraries.DNA was isolated from the 95 samples according to the manufacturer’s instruction using the Agencourt Chloropure kit (Agencourt Bioscience Corp., Beverly, Massachusetts, USA). After isolation the DNA was analysed on a 1.3% Agarose gel (Bio&SELL Universal-Agarose), and the DNA concentration was determined relative to a DNA standard. DNA dissolved in TE buffer was shipped to the Cornell University Biotechnology Resource Center (BRC, Cornell, USA) for GBS analysis.Sample preparation and sequencing was performed at the BRC using a protocol modified from Elshire et al. (http://www.biotech.cornell.edu/brc/genomics-facility) using the enzyme ApeKI for digestion. GBS libraries constructed were sequenced in the BRC Genomics Facility on the Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 (100 bp, single-end reads).In the absence of a reference genome, the assembly was done de novo. The 156 × 106 barcoded reads from the 95 samples (genotypes) were demultiplexed, trimmed for restriction site and barcode, filtered and clustered using the software pipeline pyRAD v. 3.0. If not described differently, the default settings were used. The 4 samples from M. discoidea were assigned as outgroup, with the 91 remaining samples also defined as threshold (n = 91) for the maximum number of individuals with a shared heterozygous site to account for the high proportion of polyploid samples and the outcrossing nature of M. recutita. The minimal number of samples per locus was set to 75, i.e. 75 from 91 samples having data at a particular locus, the parameter for the clustering threshold of reads within and between individuals was set to 0.88, and filtering for barcodes, adapters and cut sites was done strictly setting value “2”. The maximum ploidy level was appointed as tetraploid.Using the above criteria, the pyRAD pipeline filtered and called 6495 SNPs from the 91 M. recutita genotypes.The genetic diversity and structure of cultivated chamomile was analysed with the filtered 6495 high-quality SNPs using the admixture model of STRUCTURE 2.3.4. The outgroup (4 genotypes from M. discoidea) was excluded from the analysis, since M. discoidea was clearly different from M. recutita. Ten independent analyses with K (number of clusters) ranging from 1 to 15 with 15,000 iterations as burn-in were performed followed by 50,000 supplementary Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations. The optimal K was obtained according to Evanno et al. using STRUCTURE Harvester. For K = 3 and K = 7, an additional 10 independent analyses with 25,000 iterations as burn-in followed by 100,000 supplementary MCMC iterations were done and used for further analysis. The burn-in length was assessed by monitoring the parameters. CLUMPP v 1.1.2 was used to align the results of individual runs (Greedy algorithm).The allele frequencies were assumed to be correlated between the origins of chamomile rather than independent, as chamomile is a mainly outcrossing species whose seeds are exchanged for cultivation and breeding between regions, and thus the investigated populations / origins can share similar allele frequencies. The admixture model was used, since it is more general and does not assume each individual to belong to a single cluster. The value for lambda (allele frequencies parameter) was set to 0.3 after lambda was estimated in STRUCTURE. Otherwise, the default settings of STRUCTURE were used.Additionally, the supermatrix of concatenated sequences, 682,699 bp long, was used to compute a phylogenetic tree. The neighbor joining method with 100 bootstrap and keeping nodes above 75% was used to obtain a consensus phylogenetic tree with Geneious v.10.0.9 (https://www.geneious.com,). To validate the results from the neighbor-joining and STRUCTURE analysis, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was done.To obtain markers for GWAS analysis (genome wide association studies), the full sequences (contigs) identified by the pyRAD pipeline as harbouring all the 6495 SNPs of the STRUCTURE analysis were used to detect 44,468 polymorphic markers within a set incorporating all 95 genotypes. Due to the lack of genetic or physical map, the minor number of missing profiles were imputed by means of Random Forest algorithm through R package “missForest”. Quality control was applied such that markers with call rates less than 90% were excluded. In the end, out of the 44,468 polymorphic markers 16,972 markers, including 16,333 biallelic and 639 multiallelic, were available for subsequent GWAS. Since the single results in GWAS were subsequently evaluated (including consideration of the p-values and r2-values), different criteria for SNP filtering were applied than for the genetic structure analysis so that more SNPs could be used as basic data for the GWAS.Considering the lack of phenotyping replicates here, estimating the heritability was not feasible. Nevertheless, genomic heritability is a well-suited surrogate for the heritability. We estimated genomic heritability via a replicated (20×) 5-fold cross validation, as the square of average correlation from the 20 replications comparing predicted genotypic values and phenotypic values of respective traits.GWAS was performed with the R package “rrBLUP” using phenotypic data and the 16,972 markers obtained. The kinship matrix was estimated with a G matrix using 5768 markers (out of the total 16,972 markers) whose minor allele frequency was above 0.05. The final significance test for each marker/allele was accomplished using F-test in “rrBLUP”. The percentage of phenotypic variance explaining each significant marker was estimated via R2 by fitting a regression between phenotypes and marker profiles, as implemented in R using the function “lm”.The DNA sequences containing highly significant markers as identified by GWAS were annotated using firstly BLAST (blastn and tblastx, http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) against the NCBI plant genomes nucleotide collection of flowering plants data using the discontiguous megablast algorithm. Mapping and annotation of the BLAST-results were performed using Blast2GO 4.0.2 and default settings. Additionally, blastn against the Helianthus annuus (sunflower) XRQ genome assembly was done at https://www.heliagene.org/HanXRQ-SUNRISE/, since sunflower is the closest related species with a sequenced genome available, belonging together with chamomile in the Asteraceae. Local BLAST analysis was done with CLC Genomics Workbench 8.5 (QIAGEN Aarhus A/S).","As expected, the 4 genotypes of M. discoidea (outgroup) were clearly genetically separated from M. recutita (see Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Fig. S1 and Additional file 2: Fig. S2), and were thus excluded from further analyses. Using STRUCTURE, the optimal numbers of clusters (k) that described the population structure of the investigated chamomile were determined as 3 and 7 (Additional file 3: Fig. S3) for the main (Additional file 4: Fig. S4) and more detailed substructures (Fig. 2, Additional file 5: Table S1), respectively. Although the allele frequencies were assumed to be correlated between the origins of chamomile, STRUCTURE was nonetheless additionally run with the setting of independent allele frequencies, which lead to far less population structure differentiation (as expected and described by Falush et al.), but did not significantly differ from the outcome of the analysis with correlated allele frequencies (Additional file 6: Fig. S5). In general, the STRUCTURE analyses demonstrated that the single plants of an origin were genetically similar, with moderate exceptions occurring (Fig. 2, e.g. 005 = ‘Lutea’ or 010 = ‘Argenmilla’).  The plants characterized by 1 or 2 main STRUCTURE clusters, i.e. having one or two STRUCTURE colours > = 9.5% (Fig. 2) were mostly tetraploids (average ploidy of the whole group close to tetraploid: Additional file 7: Fig. S6), whereas all plants except one with 3 to 5 different main STRUCTURE clusters (> = 9.5%) were diploid (Fig. 2, Additional file 7: Fig. S6). Except for one genotype (‘Camoflora’ 004_04) all tetraploids had only 1 or 2 main genetic clusters, whereas diploids showed far more genetic diversity (Fig. 2 and Table 2), although several origins of wild growing chamomile populations were also relatively homogenous (020, 064, 721, 722). In particular, the 39 genotypes from 14 tetraploid origins (USA and throughout Europe) were genetically similar and homogenous, forming one large group (see Fig. 2, Additional file 8: Fig. S7: red coloured bars, Fig. 1: parenthesis “4×”, Additional file 1: Fig. S1: red coloured dots and Additional file 9: Fig. S8a). Furthermore, 9 tetraploid genotypes (‘Lutea’ = 005, ‘Zloty Lan’ = 006 and one genotype ‘Goral’ = 007_01) and all four plants ‘Manzana’ (both origins 002 and 717) formed two additional groups. ‘Manzana’, like several other origins (e.g. an accession from North Korea (516), ‘Camoflora’ (004) and a genebank accession from Bulgaria (067)), was identified as being genetically different from most of the origins (Fig. 2). No clear connection between the genetic structure (clusters) and the geographic origin was apparent, i. e. no geographic differentiation could be identified (Fig. 2 and Additional file 9: Fig. S8b), even though the origins from Argentina (010) and North Korea (516) indeed seem to be a little bit more distinct (Additional file 9: Fig. S8b).Diploid chamomile plants flowered significantly earlier than tetraploid ones (Fig. 3, Additional file 10: Table S2: average flowering time 201 d vs. 244 d, t-test: P = 4.20 × 10−5), and most of the plants (70 out of 78) flowered under long-day conditions, that is 200 DAS. Tetraploid plants showed a narrower range of FT than diploid ones (Fig. 3). In total only 8 genotypes and the 4 M. discoidea plants as outgroup flowered under short-day conditions (Table 2: all three from Argenmilla (010), two out of three from “population Croatia” (029_03, 029_04), and one from each origin ‘Bona’ (715_04), ‘Camoflora’ (04_04), and North-Korea (516_07)). All genotypes flowering under short-day conditions were diploid except for one tetraploid genotype (“04_04”) from the variety ‘Camoflora’. A PCoA-analysis revealed for most of these plants (except 715_04 and 04_04) clear differences to the later flowering ones (Additional file 9: Fig. S8c). Large differences in the content of single bisaboloids were measured between the genotypes and origins, with single genotypes tending to be rich in only one of the four bisaboloids, i.e. plants showing a high content of alpha-bisabolol often had a low content of bisabolol oxide A and bisabolon oxide A (Fig. 4, Table 2). The plants from the outgroup M. discoidea had low contents of bisaboloids, only bisabolon oxide A was present to some extent (Fig. 4). In total, 52 plants out of 80 showed no detectable content of alpha-bisabolol. The plants with high levels of the medicinal important substance bisabolol Fig. 4) were the 4 genotypes from ‘Manzana’ (002_02, 002_04, 717_03, 717_04) and the genetically defined group (see above and Fig. 2) consisting of ‘Camoflora’, ‘Lutea’ and one genotype from ‘Goral’ (007_01). The alpha-bisabolol rich genotypes were characterized by two main STRUCTURE clusters each (> = 9.5% share of each genetic cluster, compare Table 2 and Fig. 2).The estimated genomic heritabilities for the traits flowering time and content of alpha-bisabolol were above 0.4 (0.48 and 0.40 respectively, Fig. 5, Additional file 11: Table S3), while that for the content of bisabololoxide B, bisabolone oxide A and bisabololoxide A were clearly lower (0.01; 0.01; 0.14, Fig. 5, Additional file 11: Table S3). Thus, genome-wide association studies were performed for flowering time and alpha-bisabolol only, focusing on the two traits for which a high portion of the phenotypic variability can be explained genetically. GWAS resulted in the identification of 9 SNPs located in 5 different sequences for flowering time (FT) and 72 SNPs located in 60 different sequences for alpha-bisabolol content, all of which were above the defined significance threshold 0.01 under Bonferroni correction (Additional file 12: Table S4). Three sequences (2445, 3029, 4585) harboured more than one SNP associated with FT, and ten sequences (256, 1379, 1998, 2208, 2380, 2489, 5681, 6623, 6440, 6670) more than one SNP associated with alpha-bisabolol content.The BLAST alignment of the 5 sequences harbouring significantly associated SNPs (Additional file 12: Table S4) against the NCBI nucleotide collection of flowering plants identified 2 sequences with significant hits to potential candidate genes (BLAST-score of > = 80 with a sequence identity of > = 80% and an E-value <1 × 10−13) in multiple plant species. Both sequences harboured more than one significantly associated SNP: (1) “seq. 2445” with 2 SNPs: xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein with significant alignments to 30 plant species; and (2) “seq. 4585” with 3 SNPs: uncharacterized protein with significant alignments to 9 plant species, and protein kinase / salt-induced ABC1 kinase below the BLAST aligment results threshold in 2 plant species (Additional file 13: Table S5). Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase is described to be involved in self-pollination in Arabidopsis thaliana.BLAST aligment (megablast) of the FT associated sequences to the sunflower genome yielded hits for 4 of the 5 sequences on different chromosomes (multiple hits on 6 chromosomes for “2445”, single hits all in different chromosomes for “441”, “3029” and “4585”).Out of the 60 sequences (contigs) associated with alpha-bisabolol content in our study (Additional file 12: Table S4), 31 could be aligned by BLAST against the NCBI nucleotide collection of flowering plants, of which 13 sequences achieved matches above the selected threshold (listed in Additional file 13: Table S5 together with the suggested functional role of the putative gene: BLAST-score of > = 80 with a sequence identity of > = 75% and an E-value <1.33 × 10−13). For 12 of these 13 sequences specific gene products were described in multiple plant species (Additional file 13: Table S5).Whereas 8 (sequences 3218, 3223, 3249, 4194, 6598, 6694) of the 12 sequences are involved in synthesis or regulation within universal pathways and associated ubiquitous proteins in many eukaryotes or plants (Additional file 13: Table S5), 4 sequences are described to play a role in plant biotic and abiotic stress response. Interestingly, one sequence (3223) is described to be involved both in basic function and in abiotic stress response (: armadillo/beta-catenin repeat family proteins). Ascorbate peroxidase (722) responses are directly involved in the protection of plant cells against adverse environmental conditions, Glutamate receptor-like channels (1139) in plants are discussed to fulfill a function in response to an attack from pests and pathogens, and the chaperone protein ClpB1 (5721) is described to be a heat shock protein required for acclimation to high temperatures. The last sequence (1998) is predicted to encode a nuclear fusion defective 4-like protein, which is described to be required for karyogamy during female gametophyte development and fertilization in Arabidopsis thaliana.The BLAST aligment (megablast) of the 60 sequences associated with alpha-bisabolol content against the sunflower genome yielded 35 matches above the threshold for the E-value of 10−3. 12 of the 13 sequences from the alignment to different plant genomes (Additional file 13: Table S5, except the microsatellite sequence “1379”) were above the threshold value for the alignment against sunflower genome.The 35 sequences with E-value above the threshold, were aligned to all 17 chromosomes of the sunflower genome, with minimum of 1 (chromosome 17) and maximum of 7 to 8 (chromosomes 8, 10 and 13) sequences per chromosome (Additional file 14: Table S6). Among these 35 sequences, 14 were aligned to only 1 sunflower chromosome, 10 to 2 different sunflower chromosomes, and the remaining 11 to multiple chromosomes, with sequences “4194” and “5751” both being aligned to 6 chromosomes. Ten sequences were aligned to multiple loci on the same chromosome. Tblastx gave more hits against the sunflower genome, but with higher E-value and only consisting of more multiple hits against the same chromosomes.The sequences for which specific gene products in multiple plant species were identified (see above) were not concentrated on any of the sunflower chromosomes (Additional file 14: Table S6: sequence name written bold). Based on these data, no clustering of these 35 highly alpha-bisabolol associated sequences to single sunflower chromosomes could be observed.Mapping by Blast2GO of the BLAST results to retrieve gene ontology terms for FT and alpha-bisabolol content achieved no matches. Thus, no functional annotation could be done.","Tetraploid chamomile varieties were generated a very few times artificially by polyploidisation of diploid plants, as evidenced by the STRUCTURE analyses (Fig. 2). The large, genetically homogenous group of 14 tetraploid orgins, obtained from all over Europe, is likely to originate from the same polyploidised diploid genetic background, i.e. similar parental material, with minor genetic differences arising via selection and introgression during breeding. These data indicate that most of the high-performing tetraploid chamomile origins are genetically highly similar, and justify the demand to further broaden the diversity by including different germplasm in the future breeding process. Two smaller, genetically different groups of tetraploid origins with “extended” genetic background include plants with the highest alpha-bisabolol content (see below): (1) The tetraploid variety ‘Manzana’, which was generated from diploid ‘Degumille’ and (2) the group containing ‘Lutea’, ‘Zloty Lan’ and partly ‘Goral’.Two tetraploid genotypes (003_03 from ‘Bodegold’, 004_04 from ‘Camoflora’) were genetically diverse, each consisting of several STRUCTURE-clusters, although both were similar in “STRUCTURE fingerprints” to their corresponding diploid genotypes. Considering ‘Bodegold’, registered in 1962 as a tetraploid variety, which consisted of di- and tetraploid plants, we hypothesize that contamination with closely related wild growing diploid chamomile through seeds or (unreduced) pollen has led to variable ploidy. Contrarily, ‘Camoflora’ (a diploid variety) might have experienced fertilization with both unreduced male and female gametes or unreduced egg cells crossed with cultivated tetraploid chamomile, which both could have led to the detection of tetraploid genotypes in our study. However, frequent gene flow between di- and tetraploid chamomile is not expected due to the different ploidy of the gametes, which would typically lead to highly sterile triploid F1-progeny. Consequently, an increase in the genetic diversity of tetraploid chamomile origins by crosses with diploids is not likely to happen spontaneously, and hence the inclusion of different new origins in breeding programmes would likely be advantageous.In our analysis, there was no clear congruence between the genetic structure (clusters) and geographic origin (Fig. 2 and Additional file 9: Fig. S8b), i.e. no clustering due to geographic origin could be found. Even though the origins from Argentina (010) and North Korea (516) indeed seem to be genetically distinct from the European ones (Additional file 9: Fig. S8b), the samples from Russia (23), Egypt (26) and USA (27) showed strong similarity to diverse European origins. An explanation could be that regular exchange of plant material between the regions took place for this mainly outcrossing species, and that in our panel of plants were mainly cultivated chamomile origins with good agricultural performance. Franke and Schilcher discriminated the origin of chamomile flowers by their chemotype, but only from wild and not cultivated collections. For the crop plant Brassica rapa, Tanhuanpää et al. analysed 61 accessions with SNP markers and found grouping corresponding to morphotype and flowering habit, but not to geographic origin. Their results are comparable to our data, indicating the limited value of the geographic origin alone (without correlation to other traits) to genetically structure cultivated outcrossing plants for which the exchange of genetic material is not inhibited. Consequently, only with numerous wild collected samples from the natural regions of origin (e.g. Iran) specific geographic footprints in the genetic patterns might be revealed.Diploid plants flowered in average significantly earlier than tetraploid ones (Fig. 3, Additional file 10: Table S2), as has been shown for Chamerion angustifolium. It is hypothesized that (auto-) tetraploid plants develop slower and flower later due to the longer time necessary for replication of a doubled genome, which consequently may lead to slowing of metabolism and growth rates in polyploids. Since tetraploid chamomile is autotetraploid, possible effects of allopolyploidy like allelic interactions or epigenetic modifications of homoeologous loci leading to nonadditive gene regulation, are not considered.The high genomic heritability observed for the flowering time in our study (Fig. 5) additionally indicates a strong genetic influence on the flowering time in chamomile, as has been described for Arabidopsis and Brassica. Mayfield et al. hypothesized that late flowering in these genera is a dominant trait, as flowering time probably depends on the expression of a repressor gene. Thus, late flowering in tetraploids compared to diploids could be additionally influenced by higher chances for dominant alleles to be present. Bao et al. identified factors regulating flowering and endopolyploidization in Arabidopsis and suggest an involvement of cell cycle control in the timing of reproductive transition.The 5 sequences containing the SNPs significantly associated with flowering time (Additional file 12: Table S4) may serve as a starting point to develop molecular markers to be used in marker assisted selection (MAS) for FT in chamomile. Early flowering (=early harvesting) could help circumvent negative effects on yield due to summer drought, whereas late flowering might be of advantage in cold regions with late frost, especially when sowing was already done in autumn. Additionally to the effect of the ploidy on FT, molecular markers could facilitate the breeding for early or late flowering varieties by selecting genotypes with genetic factors for these traits.The BLAST alignment demonstrated that the orthologue of one of these 5 sequences (“2445”; Additional file 12: Table S4) codes for protein connected to flowering (i.e. self-pollination) in A. thaliana. Further investigations would be required to unravel the function of the identified sequences in chamomile.Only 9 chamomile genotypes (origins ‘Manzana’, ‘Lutea’, ‘Goral’ and ‘Zloty Lan’) from 2 STRUCTURE groups (Fig. 2) showed a high content of alpha-bisabolol, as has been described for ‘Manzana’, ‘Lutea’, and ‘Goral’. Here, only one out of three analysed ‘Goral’ genotypes showed a high bisabolol level, while two of three ‘Zloty Lan’ genotypes were alpha-bisabolol-rich with the third genotype being rich in alpha-bisabolol oxide B, in contrast to the data of Franke and Schilcher and Das. Our data for ‘Lazur’ also differ from the data of Franke and Schilcher as we detected high levels of bisabolol oxide A and B but no bisabolon. These differences could be explained by genotypic variability in the polymorphic varieties of this outcrossing species, potentially increased by introgression with other chamomile populations during cultivation. This potential variability should be taken into account when maintaining a variety characterized by high-levels of specific compounds serving as medicinal drug, as well as when breeding new varieties.The pharmaceutically important sesquiterpene alpha-bisabolol was detected in 28 of the analysed plants. It was previously suggested that an oxidative biosynthetic pathway converts the alpha-bisabolol to bisabolol oxide B or to bisabolol oxide A, and from the latter further to bisabolone oxide A.The 9 alpha-bisabolol rich genotypes belonged to 4 varieties (see above) from 2 different tetraploid groups, both possessing 2 main genetic clusters as defined by STRUCTURE (compare Table 2 and Fig. 2). However, a general conclusion that heterotic effects lead to the higher content of alpha-bisabolol cannot be deduced from our data (Fig. 4 and Fig. 2), as many origins with several main genetic clusters each had no detectable alpha-bisabolol content. Since only 2 tetraploid groups showed plants with high alpha-bisabolol content in our study, their membership in two main genetic clusters could also be a random effect explained by a breeding process of choosing different genetic materials as parents, but not necessarily leading to significant heterotic effects. This view is also supported by the analysis of the average heterozygosity. Some alpha-bisabolol rich genotypes displayed an elevated level of heterozygosity over the whole DNA-sequences, but more genotypes with the same level of heterozygosity contained no alpha-bisabolol (Additional file 15: Fig. S9, Additional file 16: Table S7). Wagner et al. describe the inheritance of the ability to produce alpha-bisabolol as monogenic, which does not support the involvement of a heterosis effect in its content. The gene most likely responsible for alpha-bisabolol formation is the alpha-bisabolol synthase McTPS2 identified in chamomile. The expression of such a terpene synthase was often found to be dominant in many plants including maize. In a genome wide association study of maize, several SNPs with significance for terpene production were located in terpene synthase genes. However, in chamomile, none of the SNPs associated with alpha- bisabolol content were located in the sequences of alpha-bisabolol synthase or other genes with an apparent involvement in terpene biosynthesis. Some of the SNPs controlling alpha-bisabolol biosynthesis may affect regulatory factors that also cause a positive introgression/heterosis effect.It cannot be concluded that tetraploidy leads to an enhanced potential for elevated levels of alpha-bisabolol, since only some tetraploids had high levels of it, and for ‘Manzana’ the diploid starting material (‘Degumille’:) is already described to contain high levels of alpha-bisabolol.Thirteen out of the 60 sequences harbouring the 72 SNPs significantly associated with alpha-bisabolol content could be annotated, 9 of which had orthologues in multiple plant species, of which 4 are described with roles in plant biotic and abiotic stress response (Additional file 13: Table S5).The association of genes for plant defense and stress response with alpha-bisabolol content is consistent with the antifungal and antibacterial effects of alpha-bisabolol and its oxides, which are part of their medical value. Secondary metabolites often function in plant defense and stress response, and in particular, terpenoids (a class of substances to which the bisaboloids belong) play vital roles in plant defense. Furthermore, synthesis and accumulation of natural products (i.e. secondary metabolites) is enhanced in drought-stressed plants, or by application of signal transducers. Hence, we hypothesize that moderate stress might enhance the production and thus concentration of alpha-bisabolol in chamomile, and yield as long as the overall growth of the plant is not hampered.","Our analyses of high quality SNPs enabled us to identify genetic clustering in chamomile, with some genotypes belonging mainly to one genetic cluster, while others demonstrate evidence for introgression beween different genetic clusters. Tetraploid varieties tended to be less diverse than the diploid ones. Several origins were identified as being genetically different from most other origins, suggesting their possible use for exploiting heterosis. We identified several genotypes with high levels of the medicinal important substance alpha-bisabolol. Single genotypes tended to be enriched in only one of the four bisaboloids. GWAS identified highly significant (P < 0.01) SNPs for flowering time (9) and alpha-bisabolol content (71). The data from GWAS pave the way for future research towards the identification of marker trait associations, their underlying genetics and their use in marker assisted selection (MAS) for practical breeding in German chamomile."
64,TA037595,10.1186/1475-2875-12-312,"Evaluation of two novel tablet formulations of artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem)for bioequivalence in a randomized, open-label, two-period study.","BACKGROUND: Artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem; AL) is a standard of care formalaria treatment as an oral six-dose regimen, given twice daily over three dayswith one to four tablets (20/120 mg) per dose, depending on patient body weight.In order to reduce the pill burden at each dose and potentially enhancecompliance, two novel fixed-dose tablet formulations (80/480 mg and 60/360 mg)have been developed and tested in this study for bioequivalence with theirrespective number of standard tablets. METHODS: A randomized, open-label,two-period, single-dose, within formulation crossover bioequivalence studycomparing artemether and lumefantrine exposure between the novel 80/480 mg tabletand four standard tablets, and the novel 60/360 mg tablet and three standardtablets, was conducted in 120 healthy subjects under fed conditions. Artemether,dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine were measured in plasma by HPLC/UPLC-MS/MS.Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were determined by non-compartmental analyses.RESULTS: Adjusted geometric mean AUClast for artemether were 345 and 364 ng·h/mL(geometric mean ratio (GMR) 0.95; 90% CI 0.89-1.01) and for lumefantrine were 219and 218 μg·h/mL (GMR 1.00; 90% CI 0.93-1.08) for 80/480 mg tablet versus fourstandard tablets, respectively. Corresponding Cmax for artemether were 96.8 and99.7 ng/mL (GMR 0.97; 90% CI 0.89-1.06) and for lumefantrine were 8.42 and 8.71μg/mL (GMR 0.97; 90% CI 0.89-1.05). For the 60/360 mg tablet versus threestandard tablets, adjusted geometric mean AUClast for artemether were 235 and 231ng·h/mL (GMR 1.02; 90% CI 0.94-1.10), and for lumefantrine were 160 and 180μg·h/mL (GMR 0.89; 90% CI 0.83-0.96), respectively. Corresponding Cmax forartemether were 75.5 and 71.5 ng/mL (GMR 1.06; 90% CI 0.95-1.18), and forlumefantrine were 6.64 and 7.61 μg/mL (GMR 0.87; 90% CI 0.81-0.94), respectively.GMR for Cmax and AUClast for artemether and lumefantrine for all primarycomparisons were within the bioequivalence acceptance criteria (0.80-1.25). Inaddition, secondary PK parameters also met bioequivalence criterion. CONCLUSION:Both of the novel artemether-lumefantrine tablet formulations evaluated arebioequivalent to their respective standard Coartem tablet doses. These novelformulations are easy to administer and may improve adherence in the treatment ofuncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. CLINICAL TRIALREGISTRATION NUMBER: CTRI/2011/12/002256.","Lefèvre, Gilbert, Bhad, Prafulla, Jain, Jay Prakash, Kalluri, Sampath, Cheng, Yi, Dave, Hardik, Stein, Daniel S",2013,Malaria journal,2,False,False,True,"An estimated 216 million episodes of malaria were reported in 2010, of which approximately 81% were in the African region, and approximately 91% of these were due to Plasmodium falciparum. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is currently the best available treatments and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum; they are known to improve cure rates, reduce the chances of relapse (recrudescence and re-infection), reduce the development of resistance, and may decrease transmission of drug-resistant parasites. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL; Coartem®) is the first fixed-dose ACT prequalified by WHO and it has been subsequently adopted by many countries as first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria or mixed infections (P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax). In clinical studies, AL has consistently demonstrated good efficacy (cure rate) and safety profiles.AL is recommended to be given with food as a six-dose regimen that uses a fixed-dose combination tablet of 20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine. The regimen is given orally twice daily over three days with one to four standard tablets (20/120 mg) per dose, depending on patient’s body weight. For adults and children weighing ≥ 35 kg, each dose amounts to 80 mg artemether/480 mg lumefantrine (i.e., four tablets); for children weighing ≥ 25 kg, each dose amounts to 60 mg artemether/360 mg lumefantrine (i.e., three tablets). In order to potentially enhance compliance and to reduce the pill burden, two novel fixed-dose tablet formulations, 80/480 mg tablet (80 mg artemether/480 mg lumefantrine) and 60/360 mg (60 mg artemether/360 mg lumefantrine), have been developed.The objective of this study was to demonstrate the bioequivalence with respect to exposure of artemether and lumefantrine between the novel 80/480 mg tablet and four standard tablets, and between the novel 60/360 mg tablet and three standard tablets, when administered to healthy volunteers under fed conditions.","This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-period, within formulation crossover study in healthy subjects under fed conditions as per label, as food enhances the absorption of lumefantrine. The study consisted of a 21-day screening period, two baseline periods (one before each treatment period), two treatment periods and a wash-out period of a minimum of five weeks followed by a study completion evaluation after the 264-hours blood draw of the last treatment period. Subjects who met the eligibility criteria at screening were admitted to the study site approximately 12 h prior to dosing in each period for baseline evaluations. The design consisted of two separate crossover comparisons, one comparing the novel 80/480 mg tablet versus four standard tablets (each 20 mg artemether/120 mg lumefantrine) taken once, and the second comparing the novel 60/360 mg tablet versus three standard tablets (each 20 mg artemether/120 mg lumefantrine) taken once. Study medications were administered under the supervision of study centre personnel with 240 mL of water in the morning between 07:30 and 09:00 following a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast (carbohydrate = 65.2 g (260.8 cal), protein = 37.5 g (150 cal), fat = 64.5 g (580.5 cal)). Each subject's mouth was checked to ensure that the medication was swallowed. Incidental use of paracetamol was allowed and was documented.Healthy male and female subjects of non-childbearing potential, aged 18 to 55 years, weighing at least 50 kg and with a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18–30 kg/sq m, and in good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory tests at screening, were eligible for enrolment in the study. Subjects were excluded for the following reasons: using any prescription drugs at the time of enrolment; using any other investigational drugs at the time of enrolment or within 30 days or five elimination half-lives of enrolment (whichever is longer); history of hypersensitivity to artemether, lumefantrine, or drugs of similar chemical classes; history of clinically significant cardiac disease or ECG abnormalities or prolonged QT syndrome; smoking more than five cigarettes per day and unable to refrain from smoking during the study; donation or loss of more than 400 mL of blood within eight weeks prior to initial dosing; significant illness within two weeks prior to initial dosing; recent or recurring autonomic dysfunction or acute/chronic bronchospastic disease; any medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, metabolism or excretion of the drugs (such as liver, bowel or pancreatic disease); laboratory values outside the normal laboratory range at screening; history of immunodeficiency disease; positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C result; history of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to dosing; chest X-Ray indicating evidence of an active pulmonary process; or logistical or custodial reasons. This study was conducted at Veeda Clinical Research, Ahmedabad, India. The protocol was approved by the independent ethics committee associated with the study centre. Eligible subjects were enrolled after written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and local applicable laws and regulations (clinical trial registration number: CTRI/2011/12/002256). The study design was in accordance with the guidelines on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QEP/1401/98 Rev.1/Corr-2010; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) Guidance for Industry on bioequivalence studies). The first subject was enrolled on 3 January, 2012 and the last subject completed the study on 11 April, 2012.The primary objective was to demonstrate bioequivalence with respect to exposure of artemether and lumefantrine with respect to AUClast (area under the plasma concentration time curve up to the last quantifiable concentration) and Cmax (observed maximum plasma concentration following drug administration) between the novel 80/480 mg tablet and four standard AL tablets, and between the novel 60/360 mg tablet and three standard AL tablets when administered to healthy volunteers under fed conditions. Other objectives included determination of the single-dose PK of artemether, dihydroartemisinin (DHA; active metabolite), and lumefantrine from the respective formulations under fed conditions and comparison of the DHA exposure between the respective formulations. Safety endpoints included adverse event rates, laboratory assessments, vital signs, and electrocardiographic data.For the bio-analysis in plasma of artemether and DHA, blood samples of 3 mL were collected at predefined time points - pre-dose (i.e., 0 h), 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 h post-dose. For bio-analysis of lumefantrine, blood samples of 2 mL were collected at predefined time points - pre-dose (i.e., 0 h), 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 120, 168, 216, and 264 h post-dose. The method used for the determination of artemether and DHA was a validated reversed-phase HPLC with MS/MS detection and for lumefantrine was a validated reversed-phase UPLC with MS/MS detection. The HPLC method for artemether and DHA was linear in the range of 3 ng/mL to 360 ng/mL using 10 μL of human plasma, and for lumefantrine was 50 ng/mL to 20 μg/mL using 5 μL of human plasma. For artemether at different concentrations, the intra- and interday accuracy (%) and precision (co-efficient of variation, % CV) were as follows: 3.00 ng/mL - intraday: 3.67, 1.98, interday: -0.67, 7.72; 9.0 ng/mL - intraday: 0.22, 2.58, interday: 3.44, 4.97; 36.0 ng/mL - intraday: 6.11, 1.82, interday: 4,17, 3.63; 144 ng/mL - intraday: 6.25, 1.57, interday: 3.47, 3.54; and 288 ng/mL - intraday: 0.00, 2.27 interday 2.78, 4.53. For DHA at different concentrations intraday and interday accuracy and precision were as follows: 3.00 ng/mL - intraday: 4.67, 2.54, interday: -1.33, 7.70; 9.0 ng/mL - intraday: 2.00, 4.36, interday: 2.44, 4.51; 36.0 ng/mL - intraday: 0.56, 2.43, interday: 1.67, 3.74; 144 ng/mL - intraday: 0.00, 2.47, interday: 0.69, 2.89; and 288 ng/mL - intraday: -4.86, 1.91, interday: 0.35, 6.16. For lumefantrine at different concentrations intra- and interday accuracy (%) and precision (% CV) were as follows: 50 ng/mL - intraday: 4.60, 2.03, interday: 4.40, 1.93; 150 ng/mL - intraday: 0.00, 3.39, interday: 1.33, 2.93; 3.00 μg/mL intraday: -0.67, 1.34, interday: 3.00, 4.08; 7.50 μg/mL - intraday: 3.73, 1.65; interday: 4.13, 1.45; and 15 μg/mL - intraday: 4.00, 0.63, interday: 4.00, 0.61. The PK parameters AUClast, Cmax, AUCinf (AUC extrapolated to infinity), Tmax (time required to achieve maximum plasma concentration), and terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) were calculated from plasma concentration-time data of artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine using non-compartmental analysis with WinNonlin Professional (V 6.2). Linear trapezoidal-linear interpolation was used for calculation of AUClast. AUCinf was calculated based on last observed concentration and terminal elimination rate constant (minimum of 3 data points were included in the estimation of terminal elimination rate constant excluding Cmax and terminal ‘0’ concentrations). For profiles where % AUCinf extrapolated was > 20%, AUCinf was excluded from the calculations. The actual recorded sampling times were used for PK parameter calculations.AUClast and Cmax of artemether and lumefantrine were the primary PK parameters to assess bioequivalence. It was determined from historical data that a sample size of 30 subjects per treatment sequence would be adequate to give power between 91 and 99%, such that the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of treatment geometric means for AUClast and Cmax would lie within the interval (0.8, 1.25). This estimate was based on the assumption that the true ratio between treatments for both AUClast and Cmax was 1. The within-subject co-efficient of variations for PK parameters (AUClast and Cmax) of the two analytes after administration of intact tablet was assumed ranging from 27.04 to 36.76% (Data on file, Novartis Pharma AG. Study CCOA566B2102 Unpublished).PK analyses were performed on all subjects with evaluable drug plasma data and with no major protocol deviations impacting on the PK data. Safety analyses were performed on all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug.Descriptive statistics of analyte concentrations by sampling time point as well as PK parameters by treatment included mean, standard deviation (SD), % CV, median, minimum and maximum. Concentrations below lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were treated as zero in summary statistics.An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the log-transformed (natural base) data with sequence, treatment, period, and subject nested within sequence as fixed effects. Only subjects with PK data for both periods were included in the bioequivalence assessment. Estimates of the geometric mean ratios (80/480 mg tablet versus four standard tablets; 60/360 mg tablet versus three standard tablets) and their 90% CIs were obtained. The estimates and CIs were back-transformed to the original scale, giving the ratios of geometric means for the two treatments being compared together with 90% CIs for the ratios. Bioequivalence was concluded if the 90% CIs were entirely contained within the acceptance range (0.80, 1.25). Other parameters such as AUCinf of artemether and lumefantrine, as well as AUClast, Cmax and AUCinf of DHA, were analysed using the same model. Safety assessments included the recording of adverse events (AEs; by system organ class and preferred terms) and serious adverse events (SAEs), with their severity and relationship to the study drug, the collection of clinical laboratory data for hematology, blood chemistry, urine analysis, vital signs and ECG evaluations.","A total of 120 subjects were enrolled and randomized in this study. Sixty subjects were randomized into the crossover period comparing the novel 80/480 mg tablet to the four standard AL tablets, and additional 60 subjects were randomized into the crossover period comparing the novel 60/360 mg tablet to the three standard AL tablets. Five subjects (two subjects in 80/480 mg tablet versus four standard tablets, and three subjects in 60/360 mg AL tablet versus three standard tablets) did not complete the study. Two subjects were discontinued due to adverse events, one subject withdrew consent, one subject did not report for period 2, and one subject did not complete high-fat high-calorie breakfast before the dosing as mandated for evaluations.All 120 subjects were included for PK analyses and safety analyses; 114 subjects were included in the bioequivalence assessment. The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. Male subjects of Indian origin (age range 19–53 years) participated in the study.The mean plasma concentration-time profiles of artemether, lumefantrine, and DHA of the novel 80/480 mg and 60/360 mg tablet formulations were superimposable with their corresponding standard tablet formulations (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3).Following the single dose administration, artemether was absorbed rapidly with median Tmax of three hours for both 80/480 mg tablet and four standard tablets (Table 2). A mean Cmax of 113 ng/mL was obtained for both the 80/480 mg and four standard tablets. Mean AUClast was 389 ng h/mL versus 408 ng∙h/mL and mean AUCinf was 408 ng∙h/mL versus 443 ng∙h/mL for the 80/480 mg tablet compared to four standard tablets, respectively. The mean T1/2 was in the range of 2.30-2.51 h. Lumefantrine was absorbed with median Tmax of 6.00 h. A mean Cmax of 8.92 μg/mL and 9.49 μg/mL was observed for the 80/480 mg tablet and four standard tablets, respectively. Mean AUClast for the 80/480 mg tablet was 236 μg∙h/mL compared to 243 μg∙h/mL for the dose of four standard tablets. Mean AUCinf for the 80/480 mg tablet was 261 μg∙h/mL compared to 277 μg∙h/mL for the dose of four standard tablets. The mean T1/2 was in the range of 117–120 h for the 80/480 mg and four standard tablets. For DHA, a median Tmax of 3.00 h was observed for the 80/480 mg and four standard tablets. Mean Cmax was 107 ng/mL and 110 ng/mL for the 80/480 mg tablet and four standard tablets, respectively. Mean AUClast for the 80/480 mg tablet and the dose of four standard tablets were 376 ng∙h/mL and 386 ng∙h/mL, respectively. Corresponding AUCinf values were 397 ng∙h/mL and 397 ng∙h/mL, respectively. The mean T1/2 for DHA was in the range of 1.87-1.98 h.For 60/360 mg and three standard tablet formulations, artemether was absorbed rapidly with median Tmax of 3.00 h (Table 2). Cmax for 60/360 mg tablet and a dose of three standard tablets were 91.2 ng/mL and 82.4 ng/mL, respectively. For the 60/360 mg tablet compared to the dose of three standard tablets, AUClast and AUCinf were 280 ng∙h/mL versus 267 ng∙h/mL, and 315 ng∙h/mL versus 301 ng∙h/mL, respectively. The mean T1/2 of artemether ranged between 1.83 and 1.89 h. Lumefantrine was absorbed with median Tmax of 6 h. Mean Cmax for 60/360 mg tablet and the dose of three standard tablets was 7.26 μg/mL and 8.16 μg/mL, respectively. Mean AUClast for the 60/360 mg tablet compared to the dose of three standard tablets were 181 μg∙h/mL and 200 μg∙h/mL, respectively. Corresponding mean AUCinf values were 200 μg∙h/mL and 221 μg∙h/mL, respectively. The mean T1/2 was in the range of 104–111 h for both treatments. For DHA, the median Tmax was 3.00 h for the 60/360 mg and three standard tablets. Cmax for 60/360 mg tablet and the dose of three standard tablets was 83.6 ng/mL and 78.5 ng/mL, respectively. Mean AUClast for the 60/360 mg tablet and the dose of three standard tablets were 262 ng∙h/mL and 256 ng∙h/mL, respectively. Corresponding AUCinf values were 290 ng∙h/mL and 284 ng∙h/mL, respectively. The mean T1/2 for DHA was 1.52 to 1.57 h for the 60/360 mg and three standard tablets.Adjusted geometric means and associated 90% CI of Cmax and AUClast for artemether and lumefantrine (Table 3) were contained within the interval (0.80, 1.25). Additionally, adjusted geometric means and associated 90% CI of secondary PK parameters, including AUCinf for artemether and lumefantrine, as well as Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf for DHA, were also contained within the interval (0.80, 1.25).Nine subjects (80/480 mg tablet or four standard tablets: four subjects; 60/360 mg tablet or three standard tablets: five subjects) experienced a total of ten AEs during the study period (Table 4). Seven AEs were not suspected to be related to the study medication and three AEs (two cases of vomiting and one case of pyrexia) were suspected to be related to the study medication. The affected system organ class (SOC) were injury, poisoning and external events (navicular bone fracture, radius fracture, excoriation), investigations (blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased), gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting) and general disorders and administration site conditions (pyrexia). Most AEs were mild to moderate in severity. No death and no SAE were reported during the study. No clinically significant trends in any clinical laboratory measurement and no changes in vital signs were observed during the study. One subject who received four tablets had corrected QT interval using Friderica’s formula (QTcF) and corrected QT interval using Bazett’s formula (QTcB) increases of 44 and 62 msec, respectively, from baseline (day -1) 2 h post-dose on day 1. This appeared to be a reflection of the subject’s high pre-drug exposure variability in QTcF with values of 403, 358, and 422 msec at screening, baseline, and pre-dose day 1, respectively, and with a 402 msec 2 h post-dose day 1 QTcF value. In the period 2 dosing (novel 80/480 mg tablet) there was minimal change from baseline in either QTcF or QTcB with similar drug exposure to AL. The investigator did not report this corrected QT (QTc) change as an adverse event. Based on the overall review, the QTcF and QTcB changes were considered not drug related or clinically significant but an artifact of QTc variability in the subject.","The efficacy of AL may be influenced by dosage accuracy, adherence to the treatment regimen, and food intake accompanying the treatment. The reduction in pill burden may promote adherence to treatment compared with existing formulations, and may have a significant impact on the effective treatment of malaria and subsequently a decrease in parasite transmission. The current study compared the systemic exposure to artemether, DHA and lumefantrine from novel AL single tablets of 80/480 mg and 60/360 mg to their respective number of standard market tablets.Both novel tablets of AL met the prespecified criteria for bioequivalence as the geometric mean ratios were approximately one and the 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios for the primary pharmacokinetic endpoints of AUClast and Cmax for artemether and lumefantrine were contained within the acceptance interval (0.80, 1.25) for bioequivalence. This demonstrates that rate and extent of absorption of both components of AL from the novel formulations are comparable to that from the standard tablets. In addition, other PK parameters, including those for DHA, also met the criterion of bioequivalence for Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf in both treatment comparisons and thus provide further evidence for the bioequivalence of the novel tablet formulations of AL and the respective number of standard tablets.This bioequivalence study was designed as a single dose, open-label, randomized study with a two-period, within formulation crossover design in line with both FDA and EU guidelines. Potential sources of variation (within-subject, between-subject, and subject-by-formulation interaction) and the pharmacokinetic properties of the active substances were considered. Additionally, the sample size was adequate to show bioequivalence. The four formulations were administered with food as recommended in the approved labelling for Coartem® as a meal is known to enhance the bioavailability of artemether and lumefantrine compared with the fasted state.The PK evaluations for all the formulations did not reveal any noteworthy deviation in the PK parameters in this study from those in prior studies in healthy subjects. Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf were similar between the two treatments (in both comparisons) for artemether and lumefantrine. The DHA exposure in the treatment groups was also similar. The percentage extrapolated area for calculation of AUCinf was < 20% indicating that the study sampling schemes for both artemether and lumefantrine were adequate. The disposition of artemether, DHA and lumefantrine was in line with previously published data, confirming that the concentration-time characterization and washout period of five weeks were adequate, and avoided potential crossover effects.Overall, the novel and standard AL tablet formulations were well tolerated. The overall incidence of AEs was similar across the treatment groups and in both the sequences. There was no SAE, death or discontinuation due to the study drug.Another point worth emphasizing is that the food effect was similar across all formulations. In particular, the corresponding Tmax for both artemether and lumefantrine remained the same, irrespective of the number and nature of tablets (novel versus standard tablets) and strength (20/120 mg versus 80/480 mg versus 60/360 mg), which indicate that the in vivo dissolution of artemether and lumefantrine from the novel tablets was not impacted by these modifications. The results of this study support the use of the novel tablets developed as they are easy to administer and may improve adherence in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.",
65,TA036606,10.18632/oncotarget.8152,Escin Ia suppresses the metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer by inhibitingepithelial-mesenchymal transition via down-regulating LOXL2 expression.,"The saponin fraction of Aesculus chinensis Bunge fruits (SFAC) could inhibit theinvasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Among which, escin Ia showed morepotent inhibition of the invasion than other five main saponin constituents. Itselectively reduced the expression of LOXL2 mRNA and promoted the expression ofE-cadherin mRNA, and prevented the EMT process of MDA-MB-231 cells andTNF-α/TGF-β-stimulated MCF-7 cells. Moreover, it reduced the LOXL2 level inMDA-MB-231 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. When MCF-7 cells were stimulated withTNF-α/TGF-β, transfected with LOXL2 or treated with hypoxia, escin Iadown-regulated the level of LOXL2 in MCF-7 cells. Meanwhile, escin Ia suppressedthe EMT process in LOXL2-transfected or hypoxia-treated MCF-7 cells. Of interest,escin Ia did not alter the level of HIF-1α in hypoxia-induced MCF-7 cells. InTNBC xenograft mice, the metastasis and EMT of MDA-MB-231 cells were suppressedby escin Ia. In conclusion, escin Ia was the main active ingredient of SFAC forthe anti-TNBC metastasis activity, and its action mechanisms involved inhibitionof EMT process by down-regulating LOXL2 expression.","Wang, Yuhui, Xu, Xiaotian, Zhao, Peng, Tong, Bei, Wei, Zhifeng, Dai, Yue",2016,Oncotarget,2,False,False,True,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancers, which shows higher metastases and relapse rates than other types. Usually, TNBC is treated with chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., doxorubicin, paclitaxel and cisplatin), but its relapse rate is high in the first three years due to the development of drug resistance. In addition, neither tamoxifen nor trastuzumab which can effectively treat other subtypes of breast cancers is effective for TNBC due to the lack of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Therefore, the conventional chemotherapy and the current targeted therapy are unsatisfactory for the treatment of TNBC, and it is urgent to explore new therapeutic measures with lower toxicity and high efficiency.Metastasis is a quite complicated process, in which the cancer cells break away from primary tumors, invade surrounding tissues, and migrate into other organs (e.g., bone, lung and brain) of the body through blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. Data have indicated that most of patients with TNBC had lymph node metastasis, and died of the complications caused by it. Currently, various promising researches are underway for the identification of new biologics and targeted agents for TNBC treatment, such as those about epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors and lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) inhibitors. Prevention of metastasis might be an effective approach for the successful treatment of TNBC.Aesculus chinensis Bunge is a deciduous tree that widely distributes in China, and its fruits have long been used for the treatment of various diseases. Evidence indicated that the saponin fraction from A. chinensis fruits (SFAC) possesses anti-edematous and anti-inflammatory activities. Also, SFAC exerted anti-cancer activity as shown by inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Our previous study demonstrated that SFAC could inhibit the invasion (an initiative process of metastasis) of MDA-MB-231 cells (one type of highly aggressive mammary cancer cell) but not their proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis (Figures S1 and S2). In the present study, we investigated the main anti-invasion constituent of SFAC, and characterized its action mechanisms for inhibition of TNBC metastasis.","SFAC (containing saponin constituents higher than 74.4%), escin Ia (C55H86O24, MW: 1131.26, purity ≥ 98%), escin Ib (C55H86O24, MW: 1131.26, purity ≥ 98%), escin IIa (C54H84O23, MW: 1101.23, purity ≥ 98%), escin IIb (C54H84O23, MW: 1101.23, purity ≥ 98%), escin IIIa (C55H86O23, MW: 1115.26, purity ≥ 98%) and escin IIIb (C55H86O23, MW: 1115.26, purity ≥ 98%) were obtained from Yinxing Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd.

MCF-7 cells were transfected with LOXL2 by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions.Cell migration assay was carried out by using transwell plates (Millipore, Billerica, USA) as described previously with a little modification. MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells were transfected with LOXL2, stimulated with TNF-α/TGF-β or hypoxia (a modified incubator chamber flushed with a gas mixture containing 1% O2, 94% N2 and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere). Then, they were treated with escin Ia (2.5, 5, 10 μM) or BAPN (100 μM) for 6 h, and detached and suspended in culture medium. Then, cells (1 × 104 cells/well) was added into the upper chamber of the transwell plates, while the lower chamber was full of 600 μL culture medium with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After being incubated for 6 h at 37°C, the non-migrated cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by soaked cotton swab. In addition, the cells migrated to the bottom face of the membranes were counted after being stained with crystal violet solutions. Then, fields per filter were captured randomly at a magnification of 200 × with Olympus IX51 inverted microscope.Matrigel (150 μL/well) was added to 48-well plates and allowed to polymerize for 1 h. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, MaiGaoQiao Hospital, Nanjing, China) were suspended and added into each well (8 × 104 cells/well) together with indicated concentrations of SFAC. The capillary tube formations were visualized after 24 h. The images were captured by an Olympus IX51 inverted microscope using a 100 × objective lens. The tube formation was defined by measuring the branch length of the formed tubes.Cell invasion assay was performed by using transwell chamber with 10 mm diameter and 8 μm pore size polycarbonate membrane (Corning Costar, Cambridge, UK) coated with matrigel as previously described. MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells, transfected with LOXL2 or stimulated with TNF-α/TGF-β or hypoxia, were treated with escin Ia (2.5, 5, 10 μM) or escin Ib-IIIb (5 μM) or BAPN (100 μM) for 24 h, and detached and suspended in culture medium. An aliquot (200 μL) of cells (1 × 105 cells/mL) was added into the upper chamber of the transwell, while the lower chamber was full of 600 μL medium with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After being incubated for 24 h at 37°C, the non-invaded cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by soaked cotton swab, and the cells invaded to bottom face of the membranes were counted after being stained with crystal violet solutions. Then, fields per filter were captured randomly at a magnification of 200 × with Olympus IX51 inverted microscope.MDA-MB-231 cells, MCF-7 cells transfected with LOXL2 or stimulated with TNF-α/TGF-β or hypoxia were treated with escin Ia or BAPN, and the total RNA were isolated by using TRIzol reagent according to the supplier's instructions. The cDNA was transcribed from RNA by using HiScript RT Super Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), then analyzed for the expressions of Snail, Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2, Twist, LOXL2, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), E-cadherin, breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1), metal matrix proteinase 9 (MMP9), calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (Orai1), stromal interaction molecule 1 (Stim1), Keratin19, TGF-β and VEGF by Ace Q-PCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) with the help of MyiQ2 Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, USA). The primer sequences used were listed in Table 1:MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells transfected with LOXL2 or stimulated with TNF-α/TGF-β or hypoxia were treated with escin Ia or BAPN, and the total cell lysates were prepared by using NP40 buffer (Beyotime, Nanjing, China). The equal concentration of protein lysate of all the samples was separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gel and further transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 2 h, and incubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After being washed with TBS-0.1% Tween, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies, and then visualized with ECL reagent (Guge Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China).MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells (2 × 103 cells/mL) transfected with LOXL2, stimulated with TNF-α/TGF-β or hypoxia, were treated with escin Ia or BAPN, and then detached, re-suspended and plated into 96-well chamber slides (Millipore, Billerica, USA). Cells were fixed and stained after incubation according to the supplier's instructions.Female athymic nude mice, 4–6 week-old, were obtained from Cavens Laboratory Animals Co., Ltd. (Changzhou, China). All animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.MDA-MB-231 cells re-suspended in PBS (1 × 107 cells/mL) were injected subcutaneously into the left and right mammary fat pads of mice. Two weeks after initial implantation, mice were divided into four groups: 1) control group; 2) escin Ia (2 mg/kg) group; 3) escin Ia (4 mg/kg) group; 4) BAPN (100 mg/kg) group. Escin Ia and BAPN were intraperitoneally injected three times per week for the duration of the experiment.All animals were sacrificed after five weeks of treatments, and the tumors from the breasts of mice were collected and utilized for the detection of RNA and protein by using Q-PCR and western blotting assays, respectively.The data were presented as the means ± S.E.M. Statistical analysis was performed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's test. P values less than 0.05 (P < 0.05) were accepted as a significant difference.","Our previous studies demonstrated that SFAC (5, 10, 20 μg/mL) could inhibit the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells but not their proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis of HUVECs. In order to recognize the major anti-invasion constituent of SFAC, six saponin constituents (escin Ia, escin Ib, escin IIa, escin IIb, escin IIIa and escin IIIb) isolated from it were screened by cell invasion assay (Figure 1A–1F). As shown in Figure 2A, significant invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells was observed in normal group, and escin Ia (5 μM) showed stronger inhibition (inhibition ratio: 68.92%) than escin Ib (inhibition ratio: 63.93%), escin IIa (inhibition ratio: 34.02%), escin IIb (inhibition ratio: 33.14%), escin IIIa (inhibition ratio: 48.39%) and escin IIIb (inhibition ratio: 55.72%). In addition, escin Ia (2.5, 5, 10 μM) inhibited the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by 39.46%, 64.22% and 76.23%, respectively (Figure 2B). The findings in association with the fact that the content of escin Ia in A. chinensis is much higher than escin Ib suggested that escin Ia was the major anti-invasion active constituent of SFAC.The invasion of tumor cells could be regulated by many factors such as BRMS1, E-cadherin, Keratin19, LOXL2, MMP9, Orai1, Stim1, TGF-β and VEGF. To identify the mechanisms underlying anti-invasion effect of escin Ia, its effect on the expressions of the factors mentioned above were studied. As shown in Figure 3, escin Ia (2.5, 5, 10 μM) obviously down-regulated the LOXL2 mRNA expression and up-regulated the E-cadherin mRNA expression of MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, MMP9 mRNA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was moderately down-regulated by escin Ia (10 μM) treatment. In contrast, escin Ia only showed slight effect on the expressions of BRMS1, Keratin19, Orai1, Stim1, TGF-β and VEGF mRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results suggested that LOXL2 and E-cadherin might play vital roles in the escin Ia-mediated inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cells invasion.LOXL2 and E-cadherin are thought to have close relevance to EMT process which could promote invasion and migration of TNBC cells. In addition, escin Ia treatment obviously elevated the mRNA expression of E-cadherin, a well-known marker of the EMT. As shown in Figure 4A, escin Ia obviously inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, escin Ia elevated the protein expression of E-cadherin and reduced the protein expressions of vimentin and α-SMA, other two markers of EMT, in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4B and 4C). Of note, escin Ia (10 μM) increased the protein expression of E-cadherin and reduced the protein expressions of vimentin and α-SMA in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4D). Escin Ia (5, 10 μM) down-regulated the mRNA expressions of transcription factors Snail, Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Twist in MDA-MB-231 cells, even though the pattern and degree of these alterations was somewhat different (Figure 4E). Overall, these results strongly suggested that escin Ia could diminish EMT process in MDA-MB-231 cells.Subsequently, we further investigated the anti-EMT effect of escin Ia in TNF-α/TGF-β-stimulated MCF-7 cells. When stimulated with TNF-α/TGF-β, MCF-7 cells gradually vanished epithelial characteristics and obtained mesenchymal characteristics, and got similar highly aggressive ability as MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Figure 5A, after stimulated by TNF-α/TGF-β, the protein levels of E-cadherin and vimentin, α-SMA in MCF-7 cells reached valley and peak, respectively. Escin Ia (2.5, 5, 10 μM) prevented the morphologic transition of MCF-7 cells from epithelial-like to mesenchymal-like appearance (Figure 5B). As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, TNF-α/TGF-β stimulation induced obvious invasion and migration of MCF-7 cells, and escin Ia prohibited these processes. Escin Ia reversed the reduction of the protein and mRNA expression of E-cadherin, and reversed the increase of the protein expressions of vimentin and α-SMA caused by TNF-α/TGF-β stimulation (Figure 5E–5G). The effect of escin Ia (10 μM) gradually increased with exposure time extending (Figure 5H). Escin Ia (5, 10 μM) diminished TNF-α/TGF-β-induced increase of the mRNA expressions of Snail, Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Twist (Figure 5I). Taken together, these results indicated that escin Ia could reverse the EMT process in TNF-α/TGF-β-stimulated MCF-7 cells.In a word, these findings suggested that EMT repression was an important mechanism for escin Ia-induced inhibition of the invasion of TNBC cells.LOXL2, a member of the lysyl oxidase family, has been identified as a vital promoting factor of EMT, and its mRNA expression was obviously reduced by escin Ia treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, escin Ia could suppress EMT process in MDA-MB-231 cells and TNF-α/TGF-β-stimulated MCF-7 cells. Therefore, we subsequently investigated whether inhibition of EMT by escin Ia was mediated by LOXL2. Firstly, we observed whether escin Ia inhibited LOXL2 expression in breast cancer cells. As shown in Figure 6A–6C, obvious LOXL2 protein expression was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, and escin Ia (2.5, 5, 10 μM) decreased LOXL2 protein expression. Moreover, TNF-α/TGF-β stimulation for 72 h resulted in a dramatically elevated protein and mRNA expression of LOXL2 in MCF-7 cells, which were abrogated by escin Ia treatment (Figure 6D–6G). In contrast, escin Ia showed little effect on LOXL2 expression and EMT process in MCF-7 cells (Figure S3). On the other hand, MCF-7 cells showed obvious LOXL2 expression, and exhibited a highly aggressive profile similar to MDA-MB-231 cells when transfected with LOXL2. Escin Ia and BAPN (a non-selective LOXL2 inhibitor) decreased LOXL2 expression of LOXL2-transfected MCF-7 cells (Figure 6H–6K). These data in association with the fact that LOXL2 expression was low in MCF-7 cells suggested that the inhibition of EMT of escin Ia in breast cancer cells correlated with the reduction of LOXL2 expression.In order to confirm that escin Ia inhibited EMT process through down-regulating LOXL2, we observed that effect of escin Ia on EMT process of MCF-7 cells transfected with LOXL2. Results showed that MCF-7 cells gradually vanished epithelial characteristics and obtained mesenchymal characteristics, and exhibited a highly aggressive profile as MDA-MB-231 cells when transfected with LOXL2. As shown in Figure 7A–7C, escin Ia (2.5, 5, 10 μM) and BAPN (100 μM) treatments prevented the morphologic transition of LOXL2-transfected MCF-7 cells from epithelial-like to mesenchymal-like appearance, and inhibited invasion and migration of LOXL2-transfected MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells transfected with LOXL2 showed decreased protein and mRNA expression of E-cadherin and elevated protein expressions of vimentin, α-SMA, and escin Ia (2.5, 5, 10 μM) and BAPN (100 μM) antagonized LOXL2-transfection-mediated down-regulation of E-cadherin at protein and mRNA grades, and abrogated LOXL2-transfection-induced up-regulation of vimentin and α-SMA at protein levels (Figure 7D–7G). In addition, escin Ia (5, 10 μM) and BAPN (100 μM) markedly decreased LOXL2-transfection-induced increase of the mRNA expressions of Snail, Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Twist (Figure 7H). These findings indicated that escin Ia inhibited EMT process mainly through down-regulating LOXL2.Furthermore, the anti-EMT effect of escin Ia in hypoxia-stimulated MCF-7 cells was observed. Data showed that LOXL2 level in MCF-7 cells was elevated after the cells were exposed to hypoxia. Epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics of MCF-7 cells gradually vanished and obtained, respectively. In addition, hypoxia resulted in high aggressivity of MCF-7 cells similar to MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Figure 8A–8C, escin Ia (2.5, 5, 10 μM) prevented the morphologic transition from epithelial-like to mesenchymal-like appearance, and prohibited the invasion and migration of hypoxia-induced MCF-7 cells. Obvious elevation of the protein and mRNA expressions of HIF-1α, LOXL2, vimentin, α-SMA and decrease of protein and mRNA expression of E-cadherin were observed in hypoxia-stimulated MCF-7 cells, and escin Ia (5, 10 μM) abrogated hypoxia-induced changes of LOXL2, vimentin, α-SMA and E-cadherin expressions (Figure 8D–8F), but it showed little effect on the expression of HIF-1α (Figure 8D). In addition, escin Ia (5, 10 μM) markedly decreased hypoxia-induced increase of the expressions of Snail, Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Twist mRNAs (Figure 8G). These findings indicated that escin Ia inhibited EMT process through down-regulating LOXL2 expression.To confirm the inhibitory effect on EMT and consequent anti-metastasis activity of escin Ia, a xenograft model was established by subcutaneous injection of MDA-MB-231 cells into the left and right mammary fat pads of nude mice. The metastasis from the injection sites to the lungs was studied by histological examination at seven weeks after MDA-MB-231 cells injection. The infiltration of tumor cells was observed in the lungs of mice in model group. However, no or less infiltration was detected in the lungs of escin Ia- and BAPN-treated mice. Of note, the potency of escin Ia (4 mg/kg) was superior to that of BAPN (100 mg/kg) (Figure 9A).Tumor samples from the breasts of mice in model group, escin Ia (2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg)-treated groups and BAPN (100 mg/kg)-treated groups were used to determine the effect of escin Ia on the expressions of HIF-1α, LOXL2 and EMT markers. It was shown that the expression of E-cadherin was lower, and the expressions of HIF-1α, LOXL2, vimentin, α-SMA, Snail, Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Twist were higher in the tumors in the model group. Escin Ia (4 mg/kg) and BAPN (100 mg/kg) treatments caused down-regulations of LOXL2, vimentin, α-SMA, Snail, Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Twist and up-regulation of E-cadherin at protein and mRNA grades in MDA-MB-231 xenografts mice (Figure 9B–9D). However, escin Ia (2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg) showed little effect on protein and mRNA expression of HIF-1α in breast tumors of mice (Figure 9B and 9C). Taken together, the findings indicted that escin Ia suppressed the TNBC metastasis by inhibition of EMT process and consequent invasive growth through down-regulating LOXL2.","The two primary hallmarks of TNBC are excessive proliferation and high metastasis of cancer cells. Increasing evidence has shown that the metastasis of TNBC cells mainly involves invasion, migration and angiogenesis, and the invasion is considered as the key step in metastasis process. SFAC markedly inhibited the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, and its anti-invasion potency was superior to that of inhibition of proliferation, apoptosis, migration and angiogenesis. It was suggested that invasion inhibition was the major mechanism for SFAC suppressing TNBC metastasis. In the present study, escin Ia, which showed stronger inhibition of the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells than other five saponin ingredients isolated from SFAC, was proven to be the major anti-invasion active constituent of SFAC.Invasion can be regulated by a variety of factors such as BRMS1, E-cadherin, Keratin19, LOXL2, MMP9, Orai1, Stim1, TGF-β and VEGF. These factors with lower or higher expressions are associated with poor prognosis of TNBC patients. Therefore, the abrogation of the expressions of the aberrant factors may inhibit invasion and TNBC metastasis, and can be considered as a good strategy for TNBC therapy. Our study showed that escin Ia obviously inhibited invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro, and prevented lung metastasis of MDA-MB-231 xenograft model in vivo. In addition, escin Ia markedly decreased mRNA expression of LOXL2 and increased mRNA expression of E-cadherin but not the other invasion-related factors, which indicated that LOXL2 and E-cadherin are important in escin Ia-mediated inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell invasion.EMT is a developmental and continuous process, and has been identified as the beginning of metastasis of cancers including TNBC. Indeed, overexpression of EMT markers in breast cancer biopsies correlates with tumor aggressiveness, adverse clinicopathological characteristics, increased recurrence, and shorter survival. Therefore, it may be of great therapeutic interest to develop effective therapeutic strategies to suppress EMT in TNBC cells to prevent its invasion. EMT process can be promoted by a lot of important transcription factors, such as Snail, Slug, Zeb1, Zeb2 and Twist. These factors with higher expression are associated with poor prognosis of TNBC patients. In addition, the factors are highly expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, reduction of the factors is a good method for EMT inhibition. Our present study showed that EMT process of MDA-MB-231 cells and TNF-α/TGF-β-stimulated MCF-7 cells were significantly inhibited by escin Ia treatment. In addition, escin Ia suppressed EMT process in MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. These findings indicated that EMT inhibition was an important mechanism for the anti-invasion effect of escin Ia on TNBC.LOXL2 encodes an extracellular copper-dependent amine oxidase, and it is over-expressed in various types of primary cancer tissues and cells. Importantly, increasing evidence indicates that high LOXL2 expression correlates with tumor grade and poor survival. Therefore, reduction of LOXL2 expression may be an effective approach for TNBC therapy. Our data showed that escin Ia markedly decreased LOXL2 expression of MDA-MB-231 cells, and abrogated the increase of LOXL2 expression induced by TNF-α/TGF-β stimulation, LOXL2 transfection or hypoxia in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, LOXL2 expression was also down-regulated by escin Ia treatment in MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. However, escin Ia showed slight effect on LOXL2 expression and EMT process in MCF-7 cells. It was a remarkable fact that LOXL2 but not E-cadherin, vimentin, α-SMA expressions was down-regulated by escin Ia treatment for 6 h in MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells treated with TNF-α/TGF-β. These findings suggested that escin Ia might suppress EMT process through LOXL2. Based on these findings, we further investigated the relationship between the reduction of LOXL2 expression and inhibition of EMT process by escin Ia. The results showed that EMT process of LOXL2-transfected MCF-7 cells was significantly inhibited by escin Ia treatment for 6 h, which was accompanied by a decrease of the expression of LOXL2 but not E-cadherin, vimentin and α-SMA. Moreover, escin Ia markedly reduced LOXL2 expression and suppressed EMT process in hypoxia-stimulated MCF-7 cells. These findings strongly suggested that escin Ia suppressed EMT process through LOXL2, and resulted in the inhibition of TNBC invasion.HIF-1α, a master transcriptional regulator of cellular and developmental response to hypoxia, was proven to facilitate invasion and metastatic niche formation. In MDA-MB-231 cells, knockdown of HIF-1α blocked hypoxia-induced expression of LOXL2, which indicated that HIF-1α located at the upstream of LOXL2. Our present data showed that escin Ia showed little effect on HIF-1α expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown) and hypoxia-stimulated MCF-7 cells. Consistently, escin Ia showed slight effect on HIF-1α expression in MDA-MB-231 xenograft mice.In conclusion, escin Ia is the major active constituent of SFAC for its inhibitory effect on the invasion of TNBC, and it functions by inhibition of EMT process via down-regulating LOXL2 expression.",

However, 1,25D3 doses required fordifferentiation of AML cells may cause lethal hypercalcemia in vivo. There isevidence that vitamin D₂ is less toxic than vitamin D₃ in animals. Here, wedetermined the differentiation effects of novel analogs of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitaminD₂ (1,25D2), PRI-1916 and PRI-1917, in which the extended side chains of theirpreviously reported precursors (PRI-1906 and PRI-1907, respectively) underwentfurther 24Z (24-cis) modification. Using four human AML cell lines representingdifferent stages of myeloid maturation (KG-1a, HL60, U937, and MOLM-13), we foundthat the potency of PRI-1916 was slightly higher or equal to that of PRI-1906while PRI-1917 was significantly less potent than PRI-1907. We also demonstratedthat 1,25D2 was a less effective differentiation agent than 1,25D3 in these celllines. Irrespective of their differentiation potency, all the vitamin D₂derivatives tested were less potent than 1,25D3 in transactivating the DR3-typevitamin D response elements. However, similar to 1,25D3, both 1,25D2 and itsanalogs could strongly cooperate with the plant polyphenol carnosic acid ininducing cell differentiation and inhibition of G1-S cell cycle transition. Theseresults indicate that the 24Z modification has contrasting effects on thedifferentiation ability of PRI-1906 and PRI-1907 and that the addition of a plantpolyphenol could result in a similar extent of cell differentiation induced bydifferent vitamin D compounds. The enhanced antileukemic effects of the testedcombinations may constitute the basis for the development of novel approaches fordifferentiation therapy of AML.","Nachliely, Matan, Sharony, Ehud, Bolla, Narasimha Rao, Kutner, Andrzej, Danilenko, Michael",2016,International journal of molecular sciences,2,False,False,True,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a devastating disease and is characterized by the disruption of the differentiation program in early myeloid progenitors. AML treatment is based on cytotoxic combination chemotherapy, which has changed little in the last four decades. While 50%–70% of younger patients initially respond to remission-induction therapy, incurable relapses are inevitable for most patients. Standard chemotherapy is mostly unsuitable for the elderly individuals representing the majority of patients with AML.The hormonal form of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3; Figure 1), is one of the most powerful anticancer agents, which can induce differentiation, growth arrest, apoptosis, or a combination of these in various types of cancer cells. Furthermore, low levels of the circulating 1,25D3 precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D3) are associated with shorter survival, worse prognosis, and adverse treatment outcome in myeloid leukemias and other types of cancer. In contrast to conventional or targeted chemotherapeutic drugs, 1,25D3 has only one major type of in vivo toxicity that can be life threatening at pharmacologically effective doses: hypercalcemia. Although this precludes it from use in clinical oncology, the potential benefits from 1,25D3-based anticancer therapy may be substantial. Therefore, a great number of synthetic 1,25D3 analogs (>3000) have been synthesized to date aiming to obtain a potent drug with reduced calcemic toxicity. However, apart from some encouraging results, the currently existent compounds that have reached clinical trials have not yet shown consistent clinical responses, and hypercalcemia still remains a major limiting factor. One solution to this challenge is the use of compounds that can potentiate the anticancer effects, and not the toxicity, of low concentrations of vitamin D derivatives (VDDs). For instance, we and others have shown that plant polyphenols, e.g., carnosic acid (CA) from rosemary and silibinin from milk thistle, markedly potentiate the differentiation-inducing effects of low concentrations of VDDs on AML cell lines and patient-derived leukemic blasts.Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) has been shown to exhibit essentially the same general biological effects as vitamin D3, though there is some controversy regarding the relative biopotency of the two compounds (reviewed in). Importantly, there is evidence that vitamin D2 and its derivatives are less toxic than vitamin D3 compounds in animals. In the previous study we characterized the in vitro antileukemic effects of PRI-5201 and PRI-5202 (Figure 2), the double point-modified analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (1,25D2, Figure 1). These analogs have the optimized length and unsaturation of the side-chain of their direct precursors (PRI-1906 and PRI-1907, respectively) with the addition of a very effective 19-nor modification (Figure 2). The results demonstrated superior differentiation-inducing effects of PRI-5201 and PRI-5202, as compared to 1,25D3, PRI-1906, and PRI-1907, in HL60, U937 and MOLM-13 human leukemia cell lines. In an attempt to further optimize the side-chains of PRI-1906 and PRI-1907, we here introduce a 24Z (24-cis) modification to the side-chain conjugated diene system resulting in two novel analogs, PRI-1916 and PRI-1917 (see Figure 2).In the present study, we compared the prodifferentiation activity of the novel geometric 24Z isomers to that of PRI-1906 and PRI-1907, 1,25D2 and 1,25D3, using a panel of four human AML cell lines representing different stages of myeloid maturation (KG-1a, HL60, U937, and MOLM-13). The ability of the new 24Z analogs of 1,25D2 to cooperate with CA was also examined in this study. Furthermore, a comprehensive activity comparison between the parent vitamin D compounds (1,25D3 and 1,25D2) was conducted in all the experimental models tested here.","1,25D3, 1,25D2, and analogs PRI-1906, PRI-1907, PRI-1916 and PRI-1917 were synthesized at the Chemistry Department of the Pharmaceutical Research Institute (PRI; Warsaw, Poland). Carnosic acid (>98%) was obtained from Nanjing Chemlin Chemical Industry Co. (Nanjing, China). Antibodies against VDR (C-20), RXRα (D-20) and calregulin (H-170) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA). The VDRE×6-Luc reporter construct containing a 6-fold direct repeat 3 (DR3) VDRE sequence was kindly provided by Leonard P. Freedman (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA). The pGL2-(Spp-1)2 luciferase reporter construct containing two copies of the osteopontin (Spp1) DR3-type VDRE (VDRE×2-Luc) was a gift from Roman Pérez Fernández (University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain). Renilla luciferase expression construct (pRL-null vector) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) and served as an internal transfection standard. Stock solutions of carnosic acid and VDDs were prepared in absolute ethanol. The exact concentrations of 1,25D3 and 1,25D2 in stock solutions were determined spectrophotometrically in 3-μL quartz capillaries (UltroSpec 2100 Pro, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) at 264 nm, applying the extinction coefficients (ε) of 18,300 M−1·cm−1 and 19,400 M−1·cm−1, respectively.KG-1a cells (ATCC-CCL-246.1) were obtained from Eitan Fibach (Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel). HL60 myeloblastic leukemia cells (ATCC-CCL-240) were obtained from Rachel Levy (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev). U937 promonocytic leukemia cells (ATCC-CRL-1593.2) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). MOLM-13 monocytic leukemia cells (ACC 554) were purchased from Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL), and 10 mM HEPES (pH = 7.4) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/mL and treated with test agents or vehicle (≤0.2% ethanol) for 96 h. Aliquots of 5 × 105 cells were harvested, washed with PBS and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with 0.3 μL MO1-FITC and 0.3 μL MY4-RD1 (Beckman Coulter) to determine the expression of myeloid surface antigens CD11b and CD14, respectively, as described previously (e.g.,). The cell cycle distribution was determined by propidium iodide staining of DNA and analyzed by flow cytometry, as described previously.Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/mL and incubated with test agents or vehicle (≤0.2% ethanol) for 48 h. Briefly, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously. The VDR and RXRα antibodies were used at 1:200 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. Calregulin (1:500) was used as the internal loading control. The protein bands were visualized using the Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Boston, MA, USA). The absorbance of each band was determined using the Image Quant LAS 4000 system (GE Healthcare Life Science, Little Chalfont, UK).U937 cells were transiently co-transfected with the VDRE×6-Luc or VDRE×2-Luc reporter plasmid (0.8 μg) and Renilla luciferase vector (0.2 μg) using JetPEI Reagent (POLYplus-Transfection, Illkirch Cedex, France), as described previously. Transfected cells were exposed to test agents for 24 h followed by measurement of luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). The data are presented as the normalized ratios of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity (relative luminescence units, RLU).Experiments were repeated at least three times. EC50 values for the differentiation-inducing effects of VDDs were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of dose-response curves (variable slope; three or four parameters). The values are reported as the means ± SD. The significance of the differences between treatments was estimated by unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with the GraphPad Prism 6.0 program (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).","Using a flow cytometric cell differentiation assay in four human AML cell lines, we first determined the dose-response relationship of the novel 1,25D2 analogs, PRI-1916 and PRI-1917, in comparison with their direct precursors (PRI-1906 and PRI-1907, respectively) and the parent compounds, 1,25D2 and 1,25D3. The AML cell lines used represented different stages of myeloid differentiation: KG-1a (leukemia stem-like cells), HL60 (myeloblastic leukemia), U937 (myelomonocytic leukemia), and MOLM-13 (monocytic leukemia). The extent of myeloid differentiation was assessed by bivariate analysis of surface expression of the specific monocytic marker CD14 and the general myeloid marker CD11b. Treatment with the vitamin D compounds for 96 h resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the levels of each marker (data not shown) as well as in the percentage CD14+/CD11b+ double-positive cells (Figure 3) in all the cell lines tested.The results demonstrated that, similar to the previously reported data, PRI-1907 exhibited much higher differentiation potency than PRI-1906 in all the employed AML cell lines (Figure 3 and Table 1). However, the impacts of the new 24Z modification on the activities of PRI-1906 and PRI-1907 were strikingly different. Thus, the potency of PRI-1916 was slightly higher than or equal to that of PRI-1906, which contains natural alkyl branches at C-25. On the other hand, the potency of PRI-1917 in the four cell lines was found to be consistently lower, as compared to PRI-1907 containing homologated chains at C-25 (Figure 3 and Table 1). Interestingly, the MOLM-13 cell line, which has been reported to express wild-type p53 protein, exhibited higher sensitivity to all the VDDs tested compared to the cell lines which, according to the previous studies, lack the expression of p53 mRNA: HL60, U937, and KG-1. In addition, we found that 1,25D2 was significantly less potent as the differentiation inducer than 1,25D3 in all the four cell lines (Figure 3 and Table 1).To determine whether the observed differences between the differentiation potencies of the employed VDDs correlate with their ability to transactivate the vitamin D response element (VDRE), we performed the luciferase reporter gene assay in U937 cells using two different VDRE reporter constructs: VDRE×6-Luc containing six copies of a direct repeat 3 (DR3)-type VDRE consensus sequence and VDRE×2-Luc containing two copies of the osteopontin (Spp1) DR3-type VDRE sequence. As shown in Figure 4, the two different reporter systems exhibited very similar transactivation patterns in response to the VDDs. Particularly, at a relatively low concentration of the VDDs (1 nM), there were no significant differences between the effects of these compounds, whereas, at higher concentrations (10–100 nM), all of the vitamin D2 derivatives generally displayed lower efficiency in transactivating VDRE compared to 1,25D3 without consistent differences among the individual agents (Figure 4). This supports our previous findings showing that even the strongest 1,25D2-related differentiation inducers, such as PRI-5202 and PRI-1907, were less effective DR3-VDRE activators than 1,25D3.Irrespective of their different potencies (see above), all the employed VDDs applied at low-nM or sub-nM concentrations were capable of cooperating with the rosemary polyphenol CA to produce enhanced differentiation effects on HL60, U937, and MOLM-13 cells (Figure 5a–c) but not on the most primitive, stem-like KG-1a cells (Figure 5d). Similar to our previous studies (e.g.,), we used a non-cytotoxic concentration of CA (10 μM) that is bioavailable, at least in rodents. For instance, following a single oral administration of 90 mg/kg CA in rats, the plasma level of this polyphenol was maintained at about 30 μM for at least 24 h.In addition to the highest sensitivity of MOLM-13 cells to the prodifferentiation effects of VDDs among the other tested AML cell lines (see Figure 3, Table 1 and), these cells also exhibited the highest susceptibility to the growth-inhibitory effects of PRI-1906, PRI-1907, and their 19-nor analogs (PRI-5201 and PRI-5202, respectively) as well as their combinations with CA. Therefore, we examined whether these effects are associated with changes in cell cycle distribution in MOLM-13 cells. The results demonstrated that, among the different VDDs added at a low concentration (2.5 nM), only PRI-1907 significantly elevated the G1/G0 cell population concomitant with a decrease in the percentage of the S phase (data not shown). This resulted in a significant increase in the G1/S ratio, which was further strongly increased in the presence of CA (Figure 6). Notably, while CA and the other VDDs alone did not significantly affect the G1/S ratio, it was significantly elevated by the all the VDD/CA combinations tested (Figure 6).Interestingly, in the cell lines that responded to VDD/CA combinations with enhanced cell differentiation, e.g., in U937 and MOLM-13 cells (Figure 5b,c), treatment with either CA or VDD alone as well as with the combinations resulted in increased expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its heterodimeric partner, retinoid X receptor (RXRα), as shown in Figure 7. On the other hand, in KG-1a cells that were insensitive to VDD/CA combinations (see Figure 5d), such increases in VDR and RXRα were not evident (Figure 7).","The present study is part of our ongoing research that aims to develop an effective differentiation inducer of the vitamin D2 origin with minimal or no calcemic toxicity. We have previously demonstrated that PRI-1906 and PRI-1907, the 1,25D2 analogs with extended and rigidified side-chains, exhibit increased anti-leukemia potency, as compared to 1,25D3. While PRI-1906 is substantially less calcemic than 1,25D3, the much stronger differentiation inducer PRI-1907 is also much more toxic. To improve these lead compounds, we recently introduced the 19-nor modification of the A-ring of PRI-1906, resulting in PRI-5201. This double-modified analog exhibited substantially higher differentiation activity in AML cells with only a slightly elevated calcemic effect, as compared to PRI-1906. On the other hand, such modification of PRI-1907 made the resulting PRI-5202 a slightly more potent differentiation inducer and, importantly, greatly reduced its calcemic activity, even below that of 1,25D3. These data support the hypothesis that the anticancer and calcemic activities of VDDs are regulated separately and, perhaps, independently as a result of complex interactions between the A-ring and side-chain structural moieties of the VDDs and ligand binding domain (LBD) of the VDR.Since the above 19-nor analogs are still quite calcemic for potential drug candidates, we now explore further structural transformations of our lead vitamin D2 compounds. Thus, using a panel of AML cell lines, we characterized the biological effects of the 24Z modification of the side-chains of PRI-1906 and PRI-1907 resulting in their geometric analogs, PRI-1916 and PRI-1917, respectively. The principal finding of this study is that, while the 24Z modification either had no significant effect or tended to increase the differentiation-inducing potency of PRI-1906, it markedly lowered the potency of PRI-1907 (Table 1). The biochemical basis for such surprisingly different consequences for the two analogs remains to be elucidated. However, practically, this finding suggests that, if employed for further improvement of 1,25D2 analogs, the 24Z modification should preferentially be combined with the natural structure of the terminus of the side chain, i.e., C-25 dimethyl, as in PRI-1906, and not C-25 diethyl, as in PRI-1907.Another important result was that when the two parent vitamin D compounds, 1,25D2 and 1,25D3, were directly compared at the same spectrophotometrically validated concentrations, the prodifferentiation potency of 1,25D2 was found to be significantly lower than that of 1,25D3 in all the AML cell lines tested (Table 1). Interestingly, while the lower differentiation potency of some vitamin D2 compounds (e.g., 1,25D2 or PRI-1917), as compared to 1,25D3, correlated with their reduced ability to transactivate DR3-VDREs in U937 cells (Figure 4), a similarly less efficient VDRE activation was observed even for PRI-1907 (Figure 4) or PRI-5202, which acted much stronger than 1,25D3 as differentiation inducers and were capable of upregulating VDR protein levels (Figure 7 and). The nature of these differences remains unclear. One possible scenario is that the differentiation-inducing effects of vitamin D2 derivatives may be mediated to a larger extent by non-DR3-type VDREs, e.g., by everted repeat (ER) ER9. Another possibility is that some nongenomic mechanisms (reviewed in) make a greater contribution to the induction of differentiation by 1,25D2 and its analogs compared with 1,25D3. However, a recent study has shown that 1,25D2 and its derivative paricalcitol were much less effective than 25D3, 1,25D3, and its analog elocalcitol in a rapid stimulation of l-type Ca2+ channel-mediated Ca2+ influx in human aortic smooth muscle cells. Thus, further mechanistic studies are needed to clarify the mode of action of vitamin D2 derivatives in AML cells.Finally, we show here that, similar to 1,25D3 and irrespective of their relative differentiation-inducing potencies, 1,25D2 and its novel analogs PRI-1916 and PRI-1917 could cooperate at low concentrations with the plant polyphenol CA to markedly potentiate cell differentiation and inhibition of G1-to-S cell cycle transition in a cell type-dependent manner (Figure 5 and Figure 6). The fact that the enhanced differentiation effects of these and the previously described VDD/CA combinations in sensitive AML cell lines were associated with upregulation of both VDR and RXRα protein levels (Figure 7 and) supports the positive role of the nuclear receptor to vitamin D in the potentiation of VDD-induced differentiation of AML cells by plant polyphenols. Notably, different VDD/CA combinations are not only active against AML cells in culture. We have shown that combined treatment with CA-rich rosemary extract and 1,25D3 analogs results in strong cooperative antileukemic effects in syngeneic mouse AML models in vivo, without inducing hypercalcemia. Taken together, the above findings may open up new directions for the development of effective and safe vitamin-D-based combination differentiation therapy of AML.","The important structural correlation that we have learned from this study is that the 24Z modification of the side chain is probably beneficial for the differentiation activity only in the case of the C-25 dimethyl analogs, such as PRI-1906, and not for the C-25 diethyl analogs (e.g., PRI-1907). Our results also suggest that it may be reasonable to combine the 24Z modification with modifications of the A-ring. Comparative evaluation of the calcemic activities of the 24Z analogs and next generations of vitamin D2 derivatives vs. their differentiation potencies will result in selection of the most suitable candidates for further antileukemic drug development."

In this study, wedemonstrated that T4O markedly suppressed PC cell proliferation and colonyformation in vitro and induced apoptosis. Similarly, T4O significantly inhibitedthe migration and invasion of PC cells in vitro. Through RNA sequencing, 858differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, which were enriched in theRhodopsin (RHO)/ Ras homolog family member A (RHOA) signaling pathway.Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2), a DEG enriched inthe RHO/RHOA signaling pathway, was considered as a key target of T4O in PCcells; it was significantly reduced after T4O treatment, highly expressed in PCtissues, and negatively associated with patient outcome. Overexpression of ROCK2significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of T4O on PC cell proliferation andmobility. Moreover, T4O inhibited cell proliferation in vivo and decreased theKi-67, cell nuclear antigen, EMT markers, and ROCK2 expression. In conclusion, weconsider that T4O can suppress the malignant biological behavior of PC byreducing the expression of ROCK2, thus contributing to PC therapy.","Cao, Wenpeng, Tian, Ruhua, Pan, Runsang, Sun, Baofei, Xiao, Chaolun, Chen, Yunhua, Zeng, Zhirui, Lei, Shan",2022,Bioengineered,2,True,True,True,"['**introduction** <span id=""page-2-0""></span>Pancreatic cancer is a malignant tumor with poor prognosis and remains difficult to diagnose and treat [[1\\]](#page-13-0).

']","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['**discussion** Excision and chemotherapy are the main therapeutic strategies for early PC; however, only ![](_page_11_Figure_1.jpeg) <span id=""page-11-0""></span>**Figure 6.

These studies highlight that targeting ROCK2 expression may be a strategy for cancer therapy. In the present study, we found that ROCK2 mRNA and protein levels were reduced in PC cells following T4O treatment *in vitro*. High expression of ROCK2 was observed in PC tissues compared to adjacent tissues and indicated lower DFS and OS. ROCK2 overexpression markedly suppressed the effects of T4O on PC cell proliferation and mobility. Furthermore, *in vivo* assays showed that T4O had the potential to inhibit PC cell proliferation and decrease EMT biomarkers, KI67, PCNA and ROCK2 in tumor tissues. These results indicated that ROCK2 is involved in the T4O-induced biological processes.

68,TA002010,10.3390/molecules25112589,Mutagenesis and Adaptation of the Psychrotrophic Fungus Chrysosporium pannorumA-1 as a Method for Improving β-pinene Bioconversion.,"Mutagenesis and adaptation of the psychrotrophic fungus Chrysosporium pannorumA-1 to the toxic substrate β-pinene were used to obtain a biocatalyst withincreased resistance to this terpene and improved bioconversion properties.Mutants of the parental strain were induced with UV light andN-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Mutants resistant to β-pinene were isolatedusing agar plates with a linear gradient of substrate concentrations. Activemutants were selected based on their general metabolic activity (GMA) expressedas oxygen consumption rate. Compared to the parental strain, the most activemutant showed an enhanced biotransformation ability to convert β-pinene totrans-pinocarveol (315 mg per g of dry mycelium), a 4.3-fold greater biocatalyticactivity, and a higher resistance to H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress.Biotransformation using adapted mutants yielded twice as much trans-pinocarveolas the reaction catalyzed by non-adapted mutants. The results indicate thatmutagenesis and adaptation of C. pannorum A-1 is an effective method of enhancingβ-bioconversion of terpenes.","Kutyła, Mateusz, Fiedurek, Jan, Gromada, Anna, Jędrzejewski, Krzysztof, Trytek, Mariusz",2020,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,True,True,True,"['**1. introduction** Terpenes are valuable natural substrates commonly used in the production of fine chemicals. Turpentine, obtained from biomass and also as a side product of the softwood industry, is rich in monoterpenes, such as α-pinene and β-pinene, which are widely used as raw materials in the synthesis of flavors, fragrances, and pharmaceutical compounds [\\[1](#page-12-0)[,2\\]](#page-12-1). Oxidative transformation of abundant and low-priced monoterpenes holds considerable potential for the production of a wide variety of different terpenoid derivatives which are difficult and often costly to obtain directly from plant species. Oxygenated monoterpenes are the main flavor and fragrance impact molecules of essential oils. Many of them have beneficial effects on health [\\[3](#page-12-2)[–5\\]](#page-12-3), including anti-inflammatory activity [\\[6\\]](#page-12-4). However, their high volatility, poor solubility in aqueous media, and natural toxicity to microorganisms still limit the use of these compounds in applied biocatalysis. These limitations can be overcome by slow/gradual addition of terpene into the reaction medium, use of biphasic systems containing biocompatible organic solvents or a co-solvent, and in situ product removal techniques [\\[7](#page-12-5)[–9\\]](#page-12-6). β-Pinene is commercially available at US\\$ 36 per kg, whereas the price of its oxygenated derivative, *trans*-pinocarveol, can be as high as US\\$ 134,000 per kg [\\[10,](#page-12-7)[11\\]](#page-12-8). There are data regarding the antimicrobial properties of β-pinene, used either as a purified chemical or as a constituent of essential oils [\\[12](#page-12-9)[,13\\]](#page-12-10). Some studies have also demonstrated that β-pinene and *trans*-pinocarveol, contained in the oils, show various biological effects [\\[14–](#page-12-11)[18\\]](#page-12-12). ![](_page_0_Picture_14.jpeg) Some microbial isolates have been found capable of transforming β-pinene into α-terpineol [\\[19\\]](#page-12-13). However, the rate and direction of the conversion are often inadequate for the process to be economically viable [\\[20\\]](#page-12-14). Strain developers have searched for improved strains among random survivors of mutagenesis. Even though the outcome of classical mutagenesis is difficult to predict, and the selection of mutants is always phenotypic, it still remains a fact that many producer strains with enhanced productivity currently used in industrial processes have been generated by random mutagenesis [\\[21](#page-13-0)[–23\\]](#page-13-1). In contrast to genetic engineering methods, classical mutagenesis facilitates obtaining highly efficient mutants in an easy and rapid way without specialized knowledge about microbe genomes. To obtain the required mutants, experimenters have enriched cell populations by culturing them in special environmental conditions, toxic to most cell types but less toxic or non-toxic to a desired minority of cells [\\[24](#page-13-2)[–28\\]](#page-13-3). Induced mutation has been successfully used in a number of microbial processes (other than biotransformation) employed in the production of useful end products [\\[27](#page-13-4)[–29\\]](#page-13-5). Organic-solvent-tolerant mutants of bacteria can be selected using mutagen treatments or genetically engineered from solvent-sensitive parental strains [\\[30–](#page-13-6)[32\\]](#page-13-7). Microbial tolerance to organic solvents can be improved by transforming cloned genes which encode various proteins involved in this tolerance, located in the cytoplasm or the inner or outer membrane [\\[33,](#page-13-8)[34\\]](#page-13-9). Overexpression of genes which confer tolerance to specific organic solvents results in enhanced tolerances, which can be put to practical use [\\[35\\]](#page-13-10). Mutants resistant to a particular type of abiotic stress were better adapted to other stress conditions, as expressed by their enzymatic activities. The ability of one stress condition to provide protection against other stresses is referred to as cross-protection [\\[36\\]](#page-13-11). Adaptation processes are used in many branches of industrial biotechnology, including biotransformation of chemical compounds [\\[37](#page-13-12)[–39\\]](#page-13-13), biofuel production [\\[40,](#page-13-14)[41\\]](#page-13-15), and polymer synthesis [\\[42\\]](#page-13-16). In a previous paper, we demonstrated that the psychrotrophic fungus *Chrysosporium pannorum* A-1 showed promise for the biotransformation of (1S)-(−)-α-pinene because it could be used at 20◦C. This is an advantage in bioprocess involving volatile terpenes. Thus far, it has also given the best yields of verbenol and verbenone (722 and 176 mg/L, respectively) among the microorganisms studied [\\[43\\]](#page-13-17).

After mutagenization, the surviving spores were spread on dishes with agarized BM and incubated 4 days at 20 ◦C. The number of colonies formed was compared to control plates with non-treated spores. At this stage, the drop in viability was over 90%. For further experiments, random mutants which grew well in the presence of β-pinene were isolated. For this purpose, the colonies were passaged several times on solid BM with the addition of 1% β-pinene and then sown on M2 medium with a linear gradient of β-pinene concentrations according to the Gradient Plate technique [\\[74\\]](#page-15-8). To confirm the linear concentration of β-pinene in the agar plates, pieces of M2 medium were extracted and analyzed using GC. Agar discs (6 × 8 in diameter) were cut with a sterile cork borer from at least five regions. They were then extracted with EtOAc and subjected to pinene quantification. For initial adaptation, a fragment of the mycelium of each mutant was transferred onto a Petri dish containing 10-fold diluted BM (M1) with a hollow in the center filled with β-pinene (50 µL). Colonies which grew the best were picked, and their general metabolic activity (GMA) was determined as the oxygen consumption rate in phosphate buffer according to the procedure described below. The most metabolically active mutants were transferred onto adaptive medium M1 containing β-pinene (adapted mutants) or onto wort medium M1 without the substrate (non-adapted mutants). The mutants were incubated for a month, after which another selection round was carried out based on GMA. Mutants characterized by the highest GMA were transplanted onto slants with adaptive medium M1, stored at 4 ◦C, and subcultured every month.

After two days of growth, 25 mL mycelial culture of *C. pannorum* A-1 containing a fixed amount of fungal mycelium (5 g of dry weight per L) was aseptically transferred into 100 mL beakers containing 50 mL of 0.05 M McIlvaine buffer (pH 6) with an addition of 0.5% glucose. Finally, the samples were aerated to a dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 100% air saturation and incubated with magnetic stirring (150 rpm) under a controlled temperature (20 ◦C). The electrode was calibrated before each experiment by measuring its signal in the air-saturated McIlvaine buffer prior to the addition of the mycelium. The values of the readings were expressed as percent of dissolved oxygen saturation and were then converted to oxygen uptake rate k [% × s −1 ]. In all experiments, mycelium was sampled directly from the pellet culture. Care was taken to obtain samples representative of the different pellet sizes and mycelium weights. Three independent experiments were performed. The results are reported as means of all replicates.

All β-pinene biotransformations were carried out in parallel with controls, in identical conditions, using heat-inactivated microorganisms which had been autoclaved for 15 min at 121 ◦C. For the kinetic experiment, mycelia of the parental strain and mutant 1-6 previously cultured for 2 d using the procedure described above, were harvested washed twice with sterile 0.1 M McIlvaine buffer, pH 5.0. Next, equal amounts (by weight) of biomass were aseptically transferred to Erlenmeyer flasks containing 25 mL of sterile media. Biotransformation of β-pinene (1% (*v*/*v*)) was performed on BM and on phosphate buffer, pH 6, containing 1% glucose, using 1.5 and 2.35 g of dry mass per L, respectively.

Growth was followed by measuring the dry weight of mycelium. Mycelial biomass was determined gravimetrically, after washing with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, by drying to a constant weight in an oven at 105 ◦C for 3 h. It was expressed as g/L dry weight.

"", ""*3.7. biotransformation analysis* After the specified biotransformation time, the biomass was harvested by filtration, and the liquid for product recovery was extracted twice with an equal volume of diethyl ether in a separation funnel for 10 min. Before extraction, 250 µL of a 0.1% internal standards (IS) solution in hexane was added to the filtrate. The ether fraction was collected and concentrated on rotary vacuum evaporators (BUCHI, Rotavapor R-200/205, Flawil, Schwitzerland) at a water bath temperature of 40 ◦C under mild pressure of 800 mbar.

""]nan","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['**2. results and discussion** Biotransformation of hydrophobic terpenes is limited by their toxicity to microbial biocatalysts. The metabolic activity of microorganisms, which is strongly dependent on environmental parameters, may also be affected by stressful conditions. It has been shown that the effectiveness of biotransformation largely relies on the interactions between the biocatalyst and environmental stressors, which may increase the yields of biotransformation products [\\[44\\]](#page-14-0).

Since many genes are responsible for resistance to abiotic stresses, classical mutagenesis methods combined with adaptation can provide an alternative for fast generation of efficient mutants. Mutants characterized by resistance to different stress factors can be of potential use for biotransformation of toxic organic compounds. Classical mutagenesis is especially important when the metabolic pathways and the genome in the host strain have not yet been determined, as is the case with *C. pannorum*, the species used in the present study. The lethal effect of UV used along with 0.01% NTG was studied by exposing *C. pannorum* A-1 to these mutagens for different time periods. The results show that the survival rate dropped significantly at a UV exposure time longer than 10 min and an NTG exposure time longer than 5 min. More precisely, it was found that 10 min of exposure to UV and 5 min of exposure to 0.01% NTG resulted in an approximately 9.6% survival rate, while 10 min of UV irradiation combined with 10–15 min of exposure to 0.01% NTG gave a survival rate of 1.6%.

In this selection round, twelve most active mutants were selected, which constituted 8.8% of all mutants. They were used for β-pinene biotransformation. Some of the mutants showed a substantially increased capacity to transform β-pinene to *trans*-pinocarveol (Figure [2\\)](#page-3-0). The most active non-adapted mutant (2–3) was characterized by a 2.4-fold increased biotransformation activity, whereas the average increase in activity among non-adapted mutants was 1.2-fold compared to the parental strain (*p* < 0.05) (ANOVA, Tukey\'s test). The efficiency of the biotransformation performed using mutants adapted to 1% β-pinene was on average 1.7-fold higher (per 1 g of dry weight of mycelium) than for non-adapted mutants. Large increases in biotransformation activity were observed for mutants: 2–6 (4.0-fold), 1–6 (2.4-fold), and 1–11 (1.8-fold).

In this selection round, twelve most active mutants were selected, which constituted 8.8% of all mutants. They were used for β-pinene biotransformation. Some of the mutants showed a substantially increased capacity to transform β-pinene to *trans*-pinocarveol (Figure 2). The most active non-adapted mutant (2–3) was characterized by a 2.4-fold increased biotransformation activity, whereas the average increase in activity among non-adapted mutants was 1.2-fold compared to the parental strain (*p* < 0.05) (ANOVA, Tukey`s test). The efficiency of the biotransformation performed using mutants adapted to 1% β-pinene was on average 1.7-fold higher (per 1 g of dry weight of mycelium) than for non-adapted mutants. Large increases in biotransformation activity were observed for mutants: 2–6 (4.0-fold), 1–6 (2.4-fold), and 1–11 (1.8-fold). The most active mutant (1–15) was characterized by a 4.3-fold and 7-fold higher biotransformation yield in comparison to the adapted control and the non-adapted control, <span id=""page-2-0""></span>respectively (*p* < 0.05) (ANOVA, Tukey`s test).

NTG – *N*-methyl-*N*<sup>0</sup> -nitro-*N*-nitrosoguanidine. Phenomena associated with the adaptation of microbial cells to high concentrations of toxic substrates have been investigated in various studies [\\[46](#page-14-2)[–51\\]](#page-14-3). For example, exposure of yeast cells to a stepwise increase in the level of ethanol stress has been shown to be an effective method of obtaining ethanol-tolerant yeast strains [\\[46\\]](#page-14-2). Compared with the parental strain, chemically mutagenized and spontaneous mutants exhibited increased acclimation and elevated growth rates when cultivated in sublethal ethanol concentrations, and they showed an increased survivability in lethal ethanol concentrations. Their higher tolerance to ethanol was due to the fact that they showed elevated glycerol production rates, which, in turn, was associated with an increase in the ratio of oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH) in an ethanol-compromised cell, which stimulated the yeast cells\' glycolytic activity [\\[52\\]](#page-14-4). Until now, no data have been published on the induction of psychrotrophic mutants using mutagenesis and adaptation to toxic substrates. There are also no reports on the ability of psychrotrophic fungi to biocatalyze the oxidation of β-pinene at temperatures below 25 ◦C. In this study, we attempted to fill the gap in previous research by establishing whether the mutants of the fungus *C. pannorum* A-1 had the biotechnological capability to catalyze an oxidation reaction at a low temperature and we also wanted to select mutants which produced high yields of high-value terpenoids from β-pinene. As far as we know, there are also no comprehensive reports regarding the effect of cell oxygen uptake on the biocatalytic activity of fungi. In our first experiments (Figures [1](#page-2-0) and [2\\)](#page-3-0), no correlation was found between oxygen consumption by the fungal strains and the efficiency of the β-pinene biotransformation reaction estimated after 48 h. Therefore, the kinetic experiment was performed to analyze differences in the biocatalytic activities between the parental strain and mutant 1–6, which differed in oxygen uptake rate (k = 0.0271 and k = 0.0445, respectively) (Table S2). Attention was paid to some of the most important biocatalyst characteristics, such as resistance to process conditions and a short biotransformation time. An increase in biomass growth was observed during biotransformation on basal medium (BM) (Figure [4A](#page-5-0)). A higher biomass yield was produced by the parental strain (*p* < 0.001) (ANOVA, Tukey\'s test). On the rich BM medium, the metabolism of the parental strain was geared toward utilization of carbon, phosphorous and nitrogen sources (i.e., primary metabolism). In consequence, the higher biomass yield was accompanied by a higher *trans*-pinocarveol yield, compared to the mutant (Figure [5\\)](#page-5-1). However, in these conditions, the mutant adapted to β-pinene showed a shorter biotransformation time (36 h) in comparison to the parental strain (48–60 h) (*p* < 0.05) (ANOVA, Tukey\'s test). In the case of the mutant, a lower yield of *trans*-pinocarveol was obtained along with a higher substrate depletion (Figure [5B](#page-5-1)). This indicates that further metabolization of the product must have occurred. *Molecules* **2020**, *25*, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 17 <span id=""page-5-0""></span>![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg) <span id=""page-5-1""></span>**Figure 4***.* Cell growth rate of wild-type strain and mutant 1–6 of the fungus *C. pannorum* A-1 during biotransformation on rich basal medium (BM) (**a**) and 1% glucose medium containing phosphate buffer (**b**).

Our results are consistent with the findings of Weber et al., who observed an appreciable increase in the rate of oxygen consumption by the mesophilic fungus *Cladosporium sphaerospermum* after addition of biodegradable substrates (i.e., benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and catechol) [\\[53\\]](#page-14-5). A comparison of the biocatalytic efficiencies of the mutants adapted versus non-adapted to the substrate showed that the former produced higher yields of the biotransformation product (Figure [3\\)](#page-3-1). Cell adaptation to a solvent, substrate, and/or product has been found to be a successful strategy for reducing reagent inhibition in bioconversion systems [\\[54,](#page-14-6)[55\\]](#page-14-7). Pre-delivery of low amounts of such compounds may result in increased synthesis of enzymes responsible for the transformation of xenobiotics [\\[56\\]](#page-14-8). Psychrotrophic fungi are adapted to survive in cold and very nutrient-poor environments, mainly due to the composition of their cell membranes and proteins. In addition, their enzymes are able to transform many xenobiotics into compounds that can be used as energy sources or ones that are less toxic to the cell [\\[57](#page-14-9)[–59\\]](#page-14-10). The appearance of xenobiotics in the environment may cause stress to microorganisms, which, in turn, may induce adaptation mechanisms, such as changes in membrane composition or activation of genes responsible for the synthesis of chaperone proteins and catabolic enzymes, mainly cytochromes P450 [\\[60,](#page-14-11)[61\\]](#page-14-12). Adaptation of microorganisms to a toxic substrate or induction with sublethal concentrations thereof often gives them an appropriate phospholipid profile [\\[62](#page-14-13)[,63\\]](#page-14-14). In addition, bacterial cells (e.g., *Pseudomonas rhodesiae*) exposed to such harmful solvents as toluene and chloroform often undergo permeabilization, which increases biotransformation rates by improving the diffusion of products and substrates through the cell membrane [\\[64\\]](#page-14-15). Moreover, adaptation responses to one sub-lethal stress can lead to reduced susceptibility to a different stress (cross-protection or cross-adaptation) [\\[65\\]](#page-14-16). Since sublethal stresses in the β-pinene environment might induce stress-adaptive responses that could possibly make fungal cells resistant to other lethal stress factors [\\[66\\]](#page-15-0), in the next experiment, we examined the resistance of *C. pannorum* A-1 strains to hydrogen peroxide. A remarkable increase in the decomposition of H2O<sup>2</sup> was observed for mutant 1–6 relative to the wild strain. A 3-fold higher concentration of H2O<sup>2</sup> (1.5% v/v) was required to inhibit the metabolic activity of the mutant compared to the wild strain (0.5% *v*/*v*), as shown by detection of H2O<sup>2</sup> (undecomposed by catalase) in the medium after 1 h incubation (Table [2\\)](#page-7-0). This result was confirmed by measuring the GMA of the H2O2-stressed mycelia (pre-incubated with H2O<sup>2</sup> at concentrations of 0.1–5% *v*/*v*). The examined concentrations of H2O<sup>2</sup> above 0.1% caused a gradual fall in the rate of oxygen uptake by parental *C. pannorum* A-1 (Figure [7A](#page-8-0)). Incubation in the presence of 1.0% of H2O<sup>2</sup> led to an almost total inhibition of oxygen consumption by the mycelium of this strain. A much smaller respiration-suppressing effect was observed for mutant 1–6, for which the total inhibitory concentration of H2O<sup>2</sup> was as high as 5% (Figure [7B](#page-8-0)). This finding shows that biotransformation of volatile terpenes can be run under unconventional oxygenation of the culture with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a supplemental oxygen source [\\[67](#page-15-1)[,68\\]](#page-15-2). | Presence of Hydrogen Peroxide in the Medium After 1-h Incubation |                  |            |  |  | |------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------|--|--| | H2O2 Concentration % (v/v)                                       | Wild-Type Strain | Mutant 1–6 |  |  | | Control                                                          | −                | −          |  |  | | 0.1                                                              | −                | −          |  |  | | 0.5                                                              | +                | −          |  |  | | 1.0                                                              | +                | −          |  |  | | 1.5                                                              | +                | +          |  |  | | 2.5                                                              | +                | +          |  |  | | 5.0                                                              | +                | +          |  |  | <span id=""page-7-0""></span>**Table 2.** Comparison of resistance of the parental strain and mutant 1–6 of the fungus *C. pannorum* A-1 to hydrogen peroxide as measured by their H2O<sup>2</sup> decomposition capacity.

']","['**4. conclusions** The present results demonstrate that the adapted mutants of *C. pannorum* A-1 are characterized by an enhanced resistance to stressful conditions. So far, however, they have shown moderate biocatalytic activities, giving relatively high *trans*-pinocarveol yields, which means they are still subject to optimization. The maximum *trans*-pinocarveol concentrations obtained in the experiment reported in the present paper were in the range of 147.2–314.7 mg/g d.w. × L. In our non-optimized flask system, we were able to biotransform of β-pinene worth US\\$ 0.36 to *trans*-pinocarveol with a value of US\\$ 67 (per 1 L of batch culture), using the most active mutant. This result indicates that *C. pannorum* A-1 and its mutants are efficient biocatalysts for the conversion of β-pinene to this valuable product. Further improvement in β-pinene biotransformation may be achieved by selecting blocked mutants of the isolated fungal strains, which would prevent further metabolization of the main product (*trans*-pinocarveol). Filtration-enrichment methods for selecting auxotrophs may be used for this purpose [\\[75\\]](#page-15-9). Moreover, optimization of the culture conditions in bioreactors is necessary for the strain to be utilized in larger scale bioconversion processes, as some parameters, such as oxygen supply or pH, cannot be controlled in a flask culture. The results show that it is possible to increase the rate of positive mutations by using media with a gradient of the toxic substrate and performing rapid initial evaluation of the GMA of the examined mutants of *C. pannorum* A-1. The use of the gradient plate method and subsequent determination of the GMA of the isolated mutants greatly simplifies the selection of substrate-resistant strains. Direct screening has the advantage of significantly reducing the number of cultures isolated from plates, which would normally require productivity to be tested in shake flask cultures. This method may considerably improve the selection of β-pinene biotransformation-active microbial strains and also other cultures showing biotransformation activity toward toxic substrates. **Supplementary Materials:** The following are available online, Figure S1: Agar plate with linear gradient of β-pinene concentration, Figure S2: Flowchart of the procedure for improving *C. pannorum* A-1 as a biocatalyst for β-pinene biotransformation, Figure S3: Mass spectra of unknown compounds; RI = 1275, RT = 20.1 min, Table S1: Variants of mutagenesis of the psychrotrophic fungus *C. pannorum* A-1 and their impact on survivability of conidia.

We aimed to study in anIVH model in immature rats the neuroprotective effect of betulinic acidhydroxamate (BAH), a B55α/PP2A activator that inhibits the activity of thehypoxia-inducing factor prolyl-hydroxylase type 2. IVH was induced in 1-day-old(P1) Wistar rats by the left periventricular injection of Clostridialcollagenase. Then, pups received i.p. vehicle or BAH 3 mg/kg single dose. At P6,P14 and P45, brain damage (area of damage, neurobehavioral deficits,Lactate/N-acetylaspartate ratio), white matter injury (WMI: corpus callosumatrophy and myelin basic protein signal reduction) and inflammation (TLR4, NF-κBand TNFα expression), excitotoxicity (Glutamate/N-acetylspartate) and oxidativestress (protein nitrosylation) were evaluated. BAH treatment did not reduce thevolume of brain damage, but it did reduce perilesional tissue damage, preventingan IVH-induced increase in Lac/NAA. BAH restored neurobehavioral performance atP45 preventing WMI. BAH prevented an IVH-induced increase in inflammation,excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. In conclusion, in immature rats, BAH reducedIVH-induced brain damage and prevented its long-term functional consequences,preserving normal myelination in a manner related to the modulation ofinflammation, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress.","Del Pozo, Aarón, Silva, Laura, Romero, Angela, De Hoz-Rivera, María, Villa, María, Martínez-Vega, María, Prados, María Eugenia, Muñoz, Eduardo, Martínez-Orgado, José",2022,Nutrients,2,False,False,True,"Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) affects about 25% of extremely low birthweight (under 1500 g) preterm newborns (ELBWN). IVH is a major cause of severe developmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy (CP) due to white matter injury (WMI). Blood extravasated into the brain parenchyma from disrupted germinal matrix (GM) vessels leads to brain injury firstly due to the mass effect of the hematoma and then due to the toxic effects of different components of the extravasated blood, activating harmful mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, along with excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Preventive anti-inflammatory treatments including prenatal steroids or prophylactic indomethacin reduce the incidence of IVH in ELBWN, but do not reduce the risk of developing CP and other complications once IVH has occurred. Therefore, it is accepted that there is no current treatment for established IVH in those infants and research on therapeutic strategies for this condition is warranted.Because of their favorable toxicological profile dietary triterpenoid nutrients such as betulinic acid are important not only for the prevention of different diseases but also to develop novel derivates with improved pharmacological functionalities that can be used not only for oral delivery but also for intravenous use in life endangering conditions. Thus, the semi-synthetic triterpenoid hydroxamate derived from betulinic acid (betulinic acid hydroxamate, BAH) is an inhibitor of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) that activates the HIF pathway. Post-insult administration of BAH to hypoxic-ischemic newborn rats produces robust neuroprotective effects, in a manner related to the modulation of inflammation, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress.Herein we studied if the administration of BAH post-insult would protect against brain damage induced by IVH in an immature brain. For this, we used a preclinical model that quite closely translates the typical pathophysiological and clinical events of IVH brain damage in ELBWN. In this model, IVH is induced by the paraventricular injection of Clostridium collagenase in 1-day-old (P1) Wistar rats, which show a brain developmental stage similar to that of preterm babies with 24-to-26 weeks of gestational age.","The experimental procedures met the European and Spanish regulations (2010/63/EU and RD 53/2013) and were designed and performed by researchers qualified in Laboratory Animal Science. Experimental protocol was approved by the San Carlos University Hospital Animal Welfare Ethics Committee (Madrid, Spain) (Protocol number: PROEX 122.4/21). FELASA recommendations were followed to preserve animal welfare and reduce suffering as well as the number of animals used.Pregnant Wistar rats (Charles River, Barcelona, Spain) were maintained with free access to food and water. One-day-old (P1) pups were blindly assigned to sham (SHM) or collagenase-infusion groups (IVH). All groups were sex balanced within each litter. Sample size for each group was calculated based on previous experiments of our group.Rats from both groups were similar in terms of sex distribution (male/female 21/19, 26/20 and 18/23 for SHM, IVH + Vehicle (Vehicle (VEH)and IVH+BAH, respectively, X2 = 2.97, p = 0.22), weight at procedure (6.2 (6.1, 6.4), 6.4 (6.2, 6.7) and 6.5 (6.4, 6.8) g for SHM, IVH+VEH and IVH+BAH, respectively, H = 5.62, p = 0.10) and post-procedure mortality (2/40, 5/46 and 3/41 for SHM, IVH+VEH and IVH+BAH, respectively, X2 = 1.04, p = 0.59).The experimental model has been extensively described elsewhere. Briefly, IVH pups were placed prone in a stereotaxic frame (VWR International Ltd., Radnor, PA, USA) under sevoflurane anesthesia (5% induction, 3% maintenance). IVH was induced by injecting over three minutes, using a 33-gauge Hamilton syringe (HAMI65460-03, Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) attached to a syringe holder (6860, VWR International Ltd.), 0.5 µL of sterile PBS containing 0.2 U of clostridial collagenase VII-S (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Injection site in the left germinal matrix was located using stereotactic. After 9 min, the needle was removed. Then, pups were returned to their dams. Six hours after IVH, pups were randomized to receive i.p. vehicle (IVH+VEH, n = 46) or BAH at 3 mg/kg (IVH+BAH, n = 41). BAH (supplied by VivaCell Biotechnology España, S.L.U, Córdoba, Spain) was prepared in a 1 mg/mL formulation of ethanol:cremophor:saline at a ratio of 1:1:18, and further diluted in the same vehicle to administer the dose in 0.2 mL final volume. Dosage was selected after previous studies by our group demonstrating BAH neuroprotection in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in newborn rats. SHM animals (n = 40) were similarly manipulated but without intracerebral injection. At the end of the experiment, rats were killed by a lethal injection of thiopental sodium and fentanyl citrate. for histologic studies, rats were transcardially perfused with cold paraformaldehyde (4%) and sodium chloride (0.9%); their brains were then harvested and placed in paraformaldehyde 4%. For spectroscopy or biochemical studies, rats were perfused with sodium chloride alone and their brains snap frozen and stored at −80 °C.MRI was performed at P6 and P45 in a 1 Tesla benchtop MRI scanner (Icon (1T-MRI); Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany), at the BioImaC (Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain), a node of the ICTS ReDiB. The technical specifications as well as the protocol to assess brain damage and Corpus callosum (CoCa) area using ImageJ 1.34 s software (NIH, Bethesda, Rockville, MD, USA) have been described elsewhere.Neurobehavioral tests were performed at P14 or P45, as described elsewhere. At P14, coordination (inverse geotaxis: time to turn 180° after being placed downwards on a ramp tilted at 45°) and strength (grip test: grasp reflex score after leaning a thin rod against each paw palm) were assessed. At P45, coordination (beam test: time to cross a 1 m long beam), hemiparesis (Cylinder rearing test (CRT): initial forepaw preference—left, right or both—after placing the rat in a methacrylate transparent cylinder) and memory (novel object recognition (NOR): time spent on exploration of a familiar and a novel object in a methacrylate box) were assessed. Tests were video recorded and then assessed by three different researchers blinded to the experimental group.The procedure for immunohistochemistry studies in 4 µm thick brain slices, obtained at a level corresponding to plate 21 of the Paxinos and Watson Atlas has been detailed elsewhere. To assess myelin basic protein (MBP) signal at P45, MBP antibodies (1:600; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and corresponding Alexa-Fluor conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; Life Technologies, Madrid, Spain) were used. MBP signal intensity ratio was determined by a researcher blinded to the experimental group using the LEICA LASF Software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) in microphotographs from ipsilateral and contralateral External Capsule obtained using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope system (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).Western blot studies were performed at P6 as reported elsewhere. Inflammation was studied determining the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4, 1:100; Santa Cruz, CA, USA), TNFα and NF-κB (both 1:100; R&D Systems, Minneapoli, MN, USA), quantified as protein measured/β-actin ratio. Oxidative stress was assessed determining protein nitrosylation using a detection kit (Oxyblot, Millipore Iberica; Madrid, Spain) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, expressed as OxyBlot/Total Lane Protein ratio. Brain samples contained 20 µg of total protein.Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-NMR) was performed on frozen samples from striatal area from P6 rats at the BioImaC using a Bruker AVIII500HD 11.7 T spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Karlsruhe, Germany). The technical specifications have been reported elsewhere. Lactate/N-acylaspartate (Lac/NAA) and glutamate/N-acylaspartate (Glu/NAA) ratios were calculated to assess brain injury and excitotoxity, respectively.Data showing a normal distribution (D’Agostino-Pearson test) were expressed as mean ± Standard Error of Mean (SEM) and compared using one-way ANOVA with the Holm–Šidack test for multiple comparisons, whereas those showing a non-normal distribution were expressed as median (IQR) and compared using Kruskall–Wallis with Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons. Contingency tables were studied using the X2 test. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).","As observed at P6 by MRI, PVCC led to GM hemorrhage further extended to the surrounding parenchyma and ventricles, in some cases resulting in ventricular dilation (Figure 1A). Brain damage was stable over time, as observed at P45 (Figure 1A). Administration of BAH did not modify the volume of damage (Figure 1A). In the adjacent striatal area, 1H-NMR studies (Figure 1B) demonstrated increased Lac/NAA ratio after IVH. In this case, administration of BAH prevented an IVH-induced increase in Lac/NAA ratio (Figure 1B).IVH resulted in impaired coordination and strength, as shown by the poorer performance in the geotaxis and grip tests (Figure 2A) at P14. IVH-induced motor impairment in the short term was prevented by BAH treatment (Figure 2A). Gross motor performance was still impaired at P45 in IVH rats. Motor impairment was still observed at P45 in IVH rats; at that time, IVH rats showed increased paresis in the contralateral forepaw as assessed using CRT, resulting in impaired coordination, with longer time needed to cross the beam in IVH than in SHM rats (Figure 2B), IVH also resulted in cognitive impairment, with IVH rats showing impaired working memory as assessed using the NOR test (Figure 2B). BAH treatment abolished IVH-induced long-term motor and cognitive impairments (Figure 2B).Lon-term WMI resulting from IVH was apparent at P45. Reduction in the CoCa area was demonstrable in the MRI studies (Figure 3A), whereas immunohistochemistry studies revealed a reduced MBP signal in IVH animals (Figure 3B). BAH treatment had a partial effect on IVH-induced reduction in CoCa volume. Therefore, CoCa volume in IVH+BAH animals was greater than in ICH+VEH animals but lower than in SHM animals (Figure 3A). In contrast, BAH administration fully prevented an IVH-induced decrease in MBP signal in the ipsilateral External Capsule (Figure 3B).1H-NMR studies showed increased Glu/NAA values in IVH rats, corresponding with increased excitotoxicity (Figure 4A). The increase in Glu/NAA values shown in IVH-induced animals was not observed in those treated with BAH (Figure 4A). OxyBlot studies showed increased protein nitrosylation in the IVH brain, corresponding with increased oxidative stress (Figure 4B). BAH administration prevented an IVH-induced increase in oxidative stress (Figure 4B). Inflammation was increased in after IVH, as assessed using Western blot studies. Thus, increased TLR4, NF-κB and TNFα expression was detected in IVH+VEH brains (Figure 4C). BAH showed anti-inflammatory properties, with TLR4, NF-κB and TNFα expression in the brain lower than that of IVH+VEH animals and similar to that of SHM animals (Figure 4C).","In the present work, we report that the post-insult administration of BAH resulted in neuroprotective effects in immature rats submitted to IVH induction, evaluated by neuroimaging, histological, biochemical and functional studies, in a manner linked to the modulation of inflammation, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. There are few reports of post-insult treatments showing such neuroprotective efficacy in a very immature brain. Stem cell administration leads to reduced brain damage and preservation of myelination, by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and promoting neuroproliferation, leading to long-term benefits in motor impairment, but this has been shown in P4 rats submitted to IVH by intraventricular injection of blood. In a model similar to ours, ACTH administration resulted in reduced inflammation with reduced brain damage in rats submitted to IVH by collagenase injection at P2, but brain damage was assessed only in males, follow-up ended at P8 and did not include functional studies. Our results consolidate those already reported by our group demonstrating BAH neuroprotection after hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in newborn rats. The present results are even more striking considering that in the hypoxic-ischemic model, BAH is administered 30 min post-insult, and some neuroprotective effects are still observed when it is administered up to 12 h post-insult. In the present study, BAH administered 6 h after IVH induction was markedly neuroprotective, pointing to a robust neuroprotective profile and a wide time window of efficacy for BAH. This interval was selected to strengthen the translational value of the model, since in preterm infants IVH is diagnosed after routine scans or when some complications arise, that is, hours or days after IVH is established. The pathophysiology of IVH-induced brain damage is very complex because it comprises two different mechanisms of damage: one resulting from the compressive effects of the hematoma, and the other resulting from the toxic effects of the released blood products. Although the time course of the pathophysiology of IVH-induced brain damage is not as well understood as that of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, it is accepted that compression by the hematoma is an early process and that the toxic effects of blood products develop later. Thus, it is conceivable that the late administration of BAH could not counteract the mass effects of hematoma and thus could not reduce the volume of damage. On the contrary, BAH could modulate the following processes initiated by toxic blood products, protecting the surrounding tissue from secondary damage. In support of this, we observed in the adjacent striatum that the IVH-induced increase in Lac/NAA value, a surrogate of brain damage, was not observed in IVH+BAH animals.BAH has two complementary mechanisms that explain its neuroprotective effects. BAH is a direct PHD2 inhibitor, resulting in the stabilization and accumulation of HIF-1α, which has neuroprotective effects on acute brain damage in neonatal rodents. Some of the neuroprotective effects of HIF-1α stabilization are related to the regulation of erythropoietin (EPO), VEGF and glycolytic enzyme gene transcription. Furthermore, BAH activates the B55α/PP2A pathway, which in addition to inhibiting PHD2, plays an important role in vascular remodeling and induces potent anti-inflammatory effects. Indeed, betulinic acid (BA) is a pleiotropic nutrient that mediates neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory activities by acting on other targets. Thus, it is possible that the anti-inflammatory mechanism is shared by BA and BAH. Interestingly, decarboxylated BA metabolites have been detected in human plasma and it is possible that some of these metabolites are able to mimic BAH activity.All of these properties explain the pleiotropic nature of BAH neuroprotection in our experiments, with BAH modulating excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation. Blood extravasation after IVH triggers a strong inflammatory response due to brain infiltration with inflammatory cells and the effect of blood products released after hemolysis, resulting in the upregulation of TLR4 expression, detectable in brain tissue and inflammatory cells. We observed an increased expression of TLR4 in the striatum as well as an increased expression of NF-κB and TNFα one day after IVH induction, as reported. The activation of TLR4 triggers the activation of the NF-κB pathway to induce the expression of proinflammatory genes such as TNFα. Thus, NF-κB signaling plays a key role in inflammation-based acquired immature brain damage. BAH treatment abolished the IVH-induced increase in NF-κB expression. In hypoxic-ischemic newborn rats, inhibition of NF-κB signaling not only results in neuroprotection but also in neurofunctional recovery, as was the case in our experiments. TLR4 plays a major role in IVH-induced brain damage because of the induction of inflammation, oxidative stress and excitotoxicity. Accordingly, after IVH we observed increased protein nitrosylation in brain tissue, a marker of oxidative stress seen after acute injury in the immature brain. Excitotoxicity could be particularly harmful in this scenario as TLR4 activation upregulates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) signaling. The complex relationship between inflammation and excitotoxicity and oxidative stress explains why pleiotropic substances such as BAH could be so effective in this condition, similar to what has been reported in newborn hypoxic-ischemic brain damage for BAH and other substances. Although BAH inhibition of TLR4 activation might be involved in preventing increased oxidative stress and excitotoxicity, BAH may also modulate oxidative stress and excitotoxicity through other mechanisms, such as increased EPO production by stabilization of HIF-1α or activation of the B55α/PP2A pathway.Inflammation, but also excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, are particularly damaging to immature oligodendrocytes (OL), which are the predominant type of OL cells in the immature brain. Thus, IVH affects the survival of immature OL as well as their maturational process towards myelin-producing OL cells, an effect described in the model used in this work. WMI in preterm infants is macroscopically detectable on MRI studies as it leads to a long-term reduction in CoCa volume, which correlates with developmental impairment. Those features were reproduced in our model, as described, with a reduced area of CoCa observed in MRI studies at P45 in IVH rats. Consistent with their effects on inflammation, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, BAH showed beneficial effects on the macroscopic characteristics of WMI, reducing the decrease in the CoCa area. Macroscopic WMI corresponded with histological evidence showing a decreased MBP signal in the ipsilateral External Capsule of IVH+VEH animals. The protective effect of BAH at that level was robust, with IVH+BAH animals showing an MBP signal similar to SHM animals. This is the first description of a protective effect on IVH-induced hypomyelination in very immature rat brains.WMI is the cause of long-term motor disabilities that constitute Cerebral Palsy, as well as associated cognitive and sensory deficits. In the model used in this work, it has been described that motor and cognitive (memory) deficiencies are still detectable when immature rats submitted to IVH become adults. We corroborated these findings in IVH+VEH rats, which showed motor alterations with impaired negative geotaxis and grip test performance at P14 and hemiparesis and longer time to cross a beam at P45, as well as cognitive deficits with impairment of working memory at P45. Consistent with the protective effects shown by BAH on myelination disturbances, mid- and long-term motor and cognitive disturbances induced by IVH were not observed in animals treated with BAH.","In conclusion, the administration of a single dose of BAH to immature rats after IVH induction led to robust neuroprotective effects. Although BAH treatment was unable to reduce the volume of damage, it exerted some beneficial effects on perilesional tissue, reducing brain injury and protecting the myelin maturation process, thus preventing IVH-induced WMI. As a result, BAH treatment prevented the development of long-term IVH-induced motor and cognitive disabilities. All these protective effects were obtained in a manner related to the modulation of inflammation as well as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. The remarkable protective effects of BAH on IVH-induced brain injury at biochemical, histological and functional levels, together with its pleiotropic nature point to BAH as a serious candidate to be considered for the prevention of such a devastating condition as post-hemorrhagic cerebral palsy in extremely low birthweight preterm infants."
70,TA038987,10.3389/fpls.2024.1368894,Identification and variation analysis of the composition and content of essentialoil and fragrance compounds in Phoebe zhennan wood at different tree ages.,"Wood essential oil and wood products with special fragrances are high value-addedforest products. Despite the availability of essential oil and volatile organiccompounds (VOCs) from Phoebe zhennan wood, their variation and dependence on treeage have not been examined. After essential oil extraction and wood processing,the yields and compositions of essential oils and VOCs in wood from P. zhennantrees of different ages (10a, 30a, and 80a) were determined. The yield ofessential oil from 30a wood was significantly greater than that from 10a and 80awood. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-massspectrometry (GC-MS) revealed 672 and 41 volatile compounds, respectively, in theessential oil and wood, the majority of which exhibited large fluctuations inrelative content and composition depending on tree age. Sesquiterpenoids, fattyacids and conjugates may greatly contribute to the main components of essentialoil from wood. Almost all major sesquiterpenoid compounds, such as caryophylleneα-oxide, eudesmo, and cubebene, were identified in the essential oils from the30a and 80a wood, and their relative contents were much greater than those in the10a wood. The main components of the wood fragrance were sesquiterpenoids. Thetypes and relative contents of sesquiterpenoids from wood increased with treeage. These results suggest that choosing wood from trees of a suitable age willsignificantly improve the efficiency of wood utilization.","Yang, Hanbo, Zhang, Shuaiying, Gu, Yunjie, Peng, Jian, Huang, Xin, Guo, Hongying, Chen, Lianghua, Jiang, Yongze, Liu, Minhao, Luo, Xiandan, Xie, Jiaxin, Wan, Xueqin",2024,Frontiers in plant science,2,False,False,True,"Plant-synthesized volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are metabolites that play crucial roles in the processes enabling plant survival under challenging conditions, such as defense against natural enemies. The VOCs of plants are composed of more than 1700 volatile substances, including terpenes (especially sesquiterpenoids and monoterpenes), phenols, benzoic acid derivatives, and aliphatic compounds. The unique fragrance of woody plants is one of the most distinctive characteristics of wood products. It has been suggested that fragrance directly stimulates the limbic lobe and hypothalamus, thus having a profound effect on the mind and body. Therefore, a pleasant fragrance is one of the key drivers of the high economic value of wood. The unique fragrance of wood is due to its extractives, which are secondary metabolites of VOCs. analyzed the fragrance compositions of six precious coniferous wood and reported that β-elemene, myrtenol, β-cedrene, β-cedrene, 3-carene, and p-cymene were the compounds with the strongest fragrance in Chamaecyparis obtusa, Chamaecyparis formosensis, Taiwania cryptomerioides, Cunninghamia lanceolata, Cryptomeria japonica, and Calocedrus macrolepis, respectively. For example, α-cadinol, cedrol, and α-terpineol contribute to the fragrance of T. cryptomerioides, C. lanceolata, and C. obtusa, respectively, and the fragrance of these compounds is similar to that of the wood from which they were isolated. In agarwood, more than 150 compounds, mostly sesquiterpenoids, chromones, and volatile aromatic compounds, have been identified in the fragrant heartwood. Distinct sesquiterpenes and gurjunene are the main components that contribute to the uniqueness of the fragrance of Dipterocarpaceae wood. In addition to the genetic characteristics of tree species, tree age also has a significant effect on the composition of VOCs. In Platycladus orientalis, the compositions of leaf VOCs varied among trees of different ages. However, the fragrance compounds of only a few plants have been studied, and the composition and formation of fragrant molecules are still not fully understood, especially in the wood products of woody perennials.Essential oils (EOs) are extracted from aromatic plants and are lipid-soluble, volatile natural compounds with a rich aroma. EOs are predominantly used in perfumes, cosmetics, and food flavoring due to the presence of these strong aromas. In addition, continuous research has demonstrated the immense potential of EOs and their constituent chemical species in the management, protection, and treatment of several human diseases. Several factors influence the yield and composition of EOs. Genotype, environment, and genotype × environment interaction have important effects on the yield and composition of plant EOs. Some authors have shown that the composition of conifer oils is not influenced by environmental conditions but determined only at the genetic level. For woody perennials, the yield and composition of EOs also differed among parts (stem bark, branch bark, wood, and leaves) of the tree. For instance, there were 17 compounds in EOs extracted from the bark of Phoebe zhennan but 24 compounds in leaf oil. A variety of EO compounds also exist in Cinnamomum camphora; for example, the EO yields of leaves and branches are more than two times greater than those of wood, and the oxygenated monoterpene camphor is the major component in all tissues, except for safrole in the roots. The yield of EOs from C. japonica decreased in the order of leaf>bark>heartwood>sapwood, and the compounds of EOs from the four tissues showed obvious differences. Nevertheless, the results of for 297 Phoebe bournei genotypes from 33 provenances showed no significant differences in the contents of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids between leaves and stems. The optimal yield and composition will vary with differences in the physiological age of the tree. In their reports, determined that tree age but not soil nutrients and agro-ecological factors significantly influenced the oil yield in Osyris lanceolata. Tree age affects the components of EOs in the leaves, branch bark, and stem bark of Cinnamomum burmannii. Understanding the optimal tree age for the extraction of EOs will provide a useful reference for optimizing harvest strategies and increasing productivity on a larger production scale. Phoebe zhennan S. Lee et F.N. Wei (nanmu) belongs to the family Lauraceae and genus Phoebe Nees and is mainly distributed in the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests (EBLFs) of China; it is widely cultivated in China, especially in Sichuan Province. Nanmu wood is the main source of “golden thread nanmu”, which has high economic value, and harbors EOs. The tree has an attractive visible golden thread pattern, a rich fragrance, and high durability. Due to these qualities, P. zhennan wood has become popular for use in furniture, various high-class furnishing materials, cosmetics, health products, among others. The price of nanmu wood in China is greater than $700/m3, and the price can reach $1400/m3 if the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the tree exceeds 30 cm. In their excellent review, reported that Lauraceae species produce VOCs with high economic value in the spice and perfume industries. Trees of Phoebe, a genus in the Lauraceae, emit a scent dominated by sesquiterpenoids. In our previous study, the main fragrance-related metabolites in P. zhennan heartwood were cadinene, p-cymene, and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene, which are sesquiterpenoids, monoterpenoids, and aromatic hydrocarbons, respectively. Differences in the contents and major chemical compounds between the bark and leaf oils were observed in P. zhennan. The determination of the main chemical components of EOs and VOCs affecting the quality of the wood and the establishment of quantitative methods can effectively help determine the quality of the wood in P. zhennan; however, these main components and tree age effects are currently unknown. In this study, P. zhennan wood of different ages were used as research materials. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of tree age on the yield and composition of EOs extracted from wood and the VOCs of wood. The results provide a reference for the utilization of EOs from P. zhennan and wood improvement of P. zhennan. Furthermore, this study also provides a reference for wood improvement and utilization in other tree species.","Wood samples (10a, 30a, and 80a) were collected from five P. zhennan trees of each age (five biological replicates) planted in Yibin city, Sichuan Province, China (E104.599400°, N28.208611°). The trunk at DBH (1.3 m) was harvested and air-dried for further use. The wood was ground to powder and then sifted through sieves (0.5 mm and 0.25 mm). The powder was collected for wood EO and VOC extraction.The steam distillation method was used to extract EOs from P. zhennan wood. Fifty grams of wood powder from a tree of each age was soaked in distilled water until moistened and then put in a Soxhlet drawer for reflux extraction for 6 h. After stratification, the EOs were collected for liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry (LC−MS) and gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (GC−MS) analysis.The solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method was used to extract VOCs from P. zhennan wood. Five grams of wood powder was placed in an extraction bottle that was preaged in the sample injection port of a gas chromatograph (250°C for 120 min) and preheated (30°C for 10 min). Then, the extraction fibers with 100 µm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were inserted into the extraction bottle to a distance from the wood powder of 0.5 cm and allowed to adsorb for 30 min at a constant temperature of 30°C. The extraction fibers were subjected to GC−MS desorption for 3 min (at 250°C) to perform GC−MS analysis.The EOs and VOCs were analyzed using an Agilent GC8890 plus MS5977 instrument (Agilent, Shanghai, China). The chromatographic column was an Agilent 19091S-433UI (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm, -60°C-325°C). The injection volume was 1 μL. The temperature program employed for EO detection had the following settings: an initial temperature of 50°C, an increase to 120°C at 5°C/min, an increase to 180°C at 4°C/min, and then an increase to 300°C at 10°C/min. The ion source and quadrupole were 200 and 150°C, respectively. The temperature program employed for VOC detection had the following settings: an initial temperature of 40°C, an increase to 140°C at 10°C/min, an increase to 200°C at 5°C/min, and then an increase to 300°C at 8°C/min. The ion source and quadrupole were 230 and 150°C, respectively.The EOs were analyzed using an ACQUITY UPLC System (Water, Milford, MA, USA) with an ACQUITY UPLC® HSS T3 (150 × 2.1 mm, 108 μm) (Water, Milford, MA, USA). LC-ESI (+)-MS and LC-ESI (-)-MS were separated using the method described by. Mass spectrometric detection of metabolites was performed on a Q Exactive instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with an ESI ion source. Simultaneous MS1 and MS/MS (full MS-ddMS2 mode, data-dependent MS/MS) acquisition was used.The metabolites were identified with GC−MS was performed using Agilent Mass Hunter software and the public databases HMDB, Massbank, LipidMaps, and mzCloud. The metabolites detected with LC−MS were identified using the public HMDB, massbank, LipidMaps, mzCloud, and KEGG databases and the self-built database of BioNovoGene (Chengdu, Sichuan, China) (http://query.biodeep.cn/) with the following parameters: retention time, ppm (<30 ppm), and fragmentation model. Finally, the relative contents of the corresponding metabolites are presented as the percentage of the chromatographic peak area integral relative to the total identified peak area integrals.To discriminate the metabolite variation among 10a, 30a, and 80a wood, principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed after Pareto-scaling normalization. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was conducted to analyze the accumulation modes of metabolites among different samples. DAMs were screened under the following filtering conditions: variable importance in projection (VIP)≥1 and absolute log2(fold change)≥1 (P<0.05). Finally, metabolic pathway enrichment analysis was performed based on the KEGG database in MetaboAnalyst 5.0. DAMs annotated against the KEGG database were enriched in different KEGG pathways, and pathways with a KEGG enrichment ratio with P<0.05 were considered significantly enriched and analyzed.","The color of the EOs from 10a and 30a wood was yellow−green but duller than that of the EOs from 80a wood ( Supplementary Figure 1A ). The yield of EOs from wood of differently aged trees was 2.29-7.59 μL/g ( Supplementary Figure 1B ). There was a significant difference in the EO content among wood from trees of different ages, and the EO yield in 30a wood was significantly greater than that in 10a and 80a wood. To evaluate the composition and variation of EOs and VOCs among 10a, 30a, and 80a wood from P. zhennan, an untargeted metabolomics approach was carried out using LC−MS and GC−MS to analyze the metabolic compounds of each sample. After data preprocessing, a total of 594 and 75 metabolites were obtained from the EOs by LC−MS and GC−MS, respectively. The 594 metabolites obtained with LC−MS were identified and classified into 14 superclasses, including 109 lipids and lipid-like molecules, 94 benzenoids, and 69 organic acids and derivatives ( Figure 1A  and  Supplementary Table 1 ). Of these, the 109 lipids and lipid-like molecules included 36 fatty acids and conjugates, 15 sesquiterpenoids, and 12 monoterpenoids ( Figure 1B ). In general, only a few metabolites in EOs with low relative contents showed small differences in composition and relative content between trees of the same age ( Supplementary Tables 2 ,  4 ). Cubebene was the major metabolite identified in the EOs from the 10a and 80a wood; in contrast, carvone was the major compound in the EOs from 30a wood ( Table 1  and  Supplementary Table 2 ). Forty-four of 75 metabolites from GC−MS were annotated to lipids and lipid-like molecules, which included 32 sesquiterpenoids and 12 monoterpenoids ( Figures 1C, D  and  Supplementary Table 3 ). According to the GC−MS analysis results, cadinene (15.11%) and agarospirol (21.95%) had the highest relative contents of the identified compounds in the EO from the 10a and 30a wood, respectively, and agarospirol (17.90%) and guaiol (17.90%) had the highest relative contents in the 80a wood ( Table 1  and  Supplementary Table 4 ). The main metabolites in the EOs were sesquiterpenoids, monoterpenoids, and fatty acids, and the relative contents of sesquiterpenoids in the 80a wood were greater than those in the 10a and 30a wood ( Figures 2A, B ). Thus, sesquiterpenoids may greatly contribute to the formation of EOs.A total of 40 metabolites obtained from VOCs by GC−MS were matched and classified into two superclasses, including 19 lipids and lipid-like molecules and one organoheterocyclic compound ( Figure 1E  and  Supplementary Table 5 ). Of these, the 19 lipids and lipid-like molecules included 13 sesquiterpenoids and six monoterpenoids ( Figure 1F ). Similar to the results for EOs, only a few metabolites in VOCs with low relative contents showed small differences in composition and relative content between trees of the same age ( Supplementary Table 6 ). According to the GC−MS analysis results, the major metabolite identified in the VOCs from 10a and 30a wood was agarospirol ( Table 1  and  Supplementary Table 6 ). For 80a wood, the major identified VOCs were agarospirol and eudesmol. The main compounds of P. zhennan wood VOCs were sesquiterpenoids (70.22%-88.45%), and the relative contents of sesquiterpenoids in 10a and 30a wood were greater than those in 80a wood ( Figure 2C ). Hence, sesquiterpenoids are important metabolites that contribute to the fragrance of P. zhennan wood.To obtain preliminary knowledge of the metabolite variation in EOs and VOCs among 10a, 30a, and 80a wood, the metabolic data matrix for wood from trees of three ages was analyzed using PCA. The principal components of the PCA plot explained 88.6%, 55.7%, and 72.8% of the total variance in the EOs according to LC−MS and GC−MS and VOCs according to GC−MS, respectively ( Figures 3A, C, E ). According to the PCA plot, the three groups were well separated, indicating significant differences in metabolism among wood samples from trees of different ages. The clustering heatmap also revealed obvious variation in metabolite accumulation patterns among the 10a, 30a, and 80a wood ( Figures 3B, D, F ). In the EOs analyzed by LC−MS, the accumulation of 94 metabolites (C3) increased in 80a wood (carbohydrates and carbohydrate conjugates, amino acids, peptides and analogs, fatty acids and conjugates, etc.), 138 metabolites (C5) increased in 10a wood (amino acids, peptides and analogs, alcohols and polyols, fatty acids and conjugates, etc.), 156 metabolites (C4) increased in 30a wood (fatty acids and conjugates, amino acids, peptides and analogs, and monoterpenoids, etc.), 157 metabolites (C2) increased in both 10a and 30a wood (amino acids, peptides and analogs, carbohydrates and carbohydrate conjugates, alcohols and polyols, etc.), and 51 metabolites (C1) increased in both 30a and 80a wood (amino acids, peptides and analogs, fatty acids and conjugates, and derivatives, etc.) ( Figure 3B ). According to GC−MS analysis of the EOs, 20 metabolites (C2) were up-accumulated in 30a wood (five sesquiterpenoids and two monoterpenoids), 28 metabolites (C3) were up-accumulated in 10a wood (nine sesquiterpenoids and four monoterpenoids), and 28 metabolites (C1) were up-accumulated in 80a wood (10 sesquiterpenoids and six monoterpenoids) ( Figure 3D ). The 41 VOCs were separated into three clusters; of these, 18 metabolites (C1) were up-accumulated in 80a wood (five sesquiterpenoids and four monoterpenoids), 17 metabolites (C2) were up-accumulated in 30a wood (five sesquiterpenoids and two monoterpenoids), and six metabolites (C3) were up-accumulated in 10a wood (one sesquiterpenoid) ( Figure 3F ).To obtain better discrimination among groups of 10a, 30a, and 80a wood, OPLSA-DA was employed to maximize the differences between the wood samples. The 10a wood and the 30a and 80a wood from trees of different ages were obviously separated into two blocks on the basis of their metabolic profiles in the OPLS-DA model, indicating that tree age had an impact on the metabolic profiles of EOs and VOCs ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). The simulated values of R2 and Q2 on the left side were smaller than the original values in the upper right corner, suggesting that the original models were effective and reliable. These results indicated that the OPLS-DA models have good predictive ability and could be applied to further metabolite variance analysis. The S-plot displayed the crucial differences among the comparison groups of three tree ages ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). For the EOs, a total of 53 (9), 51 (9), and 50 (6) potential differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) identified via LC−MS (GC−MS) were screened in the 10a vs. 30a, 10a vs. 80a, and 30a vs. 80a comparison groups, respectively ( Supplementary Figures 3A−F ;  Supplementary Table 7 ). For fragrance-related metabolites, a total of 25, 22, and 21 potentially DAMs were screened in the 10a vs. 30a, 10a vs. 80a, and 30a vs. 80a comparison groups, respectively ( Supplementary Figures 3G–I ;  Supplementary Table 8 ). There were high numbers of sesquiterpenoids, amino acids, and peptides and analogs in the EOs, and the VOCs significantly differed among the 10a, 30a, and 80a wood, especially in the 10a vs. 30a and 10a vs. 80a comparison groups ( Figure 4 ).To further screen the DAMs of EOs and VOCs among wood from trees of three different ages, a volcano plot was used to visualize the significantly DAMs ( Figure 5A ). LC−MS revealed a total of 209 (108 up- and 101 down-accumulated), 338 (51 up- and 287 down-accumulated), and 330 (53 up- and 277 were down-accumulated) significantly DAMs in the EOs for the 10a vs. 30a, 10a vs. 80a, and 30a vs. 80a comparison groups, respectively. For GC−MS analysis, there were 45 (17 up- and 28 down-accumulated), 49 (25 up- and 24 down-accumulated), and 57 (34 up- and 23 down-accumulated) significantly DAMs of EOs in the 10a vs. 30a, 10a vs. 80a, and 30a vs. 80a comparison groups, respectively. The final significantly DAMs were defined as those with a relative log2FC≥1.0 and ≤1.0, P˂0.05, and VIP ≥1. There were 34 (22 up- and 12 down-accumulated), 45 (8 up- and 37 down-accumulated), and 43 (5 up- and 38 down-accumulated) significant DAMs of EO according to LC−MS analysis for the comparison groups of 10a vs. 30a, 10a vs. 80a, and 30a vs. 80a, respectively ( Figure 5B  and  Supplementary Table 9 ). The Venn diagram showed that nine DAMs were common among the three comparison groups, and three (two up- and one down-accumulated), eight (three up- and five down-accumulated), and two (down-accumulated) DAMs were unique in the comparison groups of 10a vs. 30a, 10a vs. 80a, and 30a vs. 80a, respectively ( Figure 5B ). A total of nine (down-accumulated), eight (three up- and five down-accumulated), and six (up-accumulated) DAMs of EOs were identified by GC−MS analysis in the comparison groups of 10a vs. 30a, 10a vs. 80a, and 30a vs. 80a, respectively ( Figure 5C  and  Supplementary Table 9 ). The Venn diagram showed that one DAM was common among the three comparison groups, and two DAMs (one up- and one down-accumulated) were unique to the 10a vs. 30a and 30a vs. 80a comparison groups, respectively ( Figure 5C ). As the main compounds of EOs, three monoterpenoids (cuminaldehyde, carvone, and perillic acid) and three sesquiterpenoids (capsidiol, caryophyllene α-oxide, and abscisic acid) accumulated significantly more in 30a wood than in 10a and 80a wood ( Figure 6A  and  Supplementary Table 10 ). Compared with those from 10a wood, the EOs from 80a wood had three sesquiterpenoids (caryophyllene, guaiol, and eudesmol) that were significantly accumulated.For wood VOCs, a total of 25 (22 up- and three down-accumulated), 29 (23 up- and six down-accumulated), and 34 (15 up- and 19 down-accumulated) significantly DAMs were detected in the 10a vs. 30a, 10a vs. 80a, and 30a vs. 80a comparison groups, respectively ( Figure 5A ). For VOCs, there were seven (six up- and one down-accumulated), three (up-accumulated), and three (up-accumulated) DAMs in the 10a vs. 30a, 10a vs. 80a, and 30a vs. 80a comparison groups, respectively ( Figure 5D  and  Supplementary Table 9 ). A Venn diagram showed no common DAMs detected among all three comparison groups, and seven (six up- and one down-accumulated) DAMs were unique to the 10a vs. 30a comparison group ( Figure 5D ). Among the wood VOCs, one monoterpenoid (verbenol) was detected only in the 30a and 80a wood ( Figure 6B  and  Supplementary Table 11 ). Caryophyllene oxide was found only in the 30a wood. The relative content of -eudesmol was significantly greater in the 80a wood than in the 10a and 30a wood.To understand the metabolic pathway variation of EOs and VOCs in wood of different ages, metabolic pathway enrichment analysis was applied according to the KEGG database. The DAMs of EO in the 10a vs. 30a, 10a vs. 80a, and 30a vs. 80a comparison groups were enriched mainly in 52, 58, and 60 pathways, respectively. The significant pathways were mainly involved in tyrosine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, etc.,., indicating that tree age also affects the composition and contents of other bioactive metabolites, such as flavonoids, in EOs ( Figure 7 ). The sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways changed significantly at P<0.05 in the comparisons of 10a vs. 30a and 30a vs. 80a, implying that the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid metabolites screened in this study affect the EOs of wood from trees of different ages. The biosynthesis of unclassified secondary metabolites and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids pathways also changed significantly at P<0.05 in the comparisons of 10a vs. 30a and 30a vs. 80a, indicating that the secondary metabolites and unsaturated fatty acids screened in this study may also affect the EO of wood among trees of three different ages. Unfortunately, no DAMs of VOCs detected by GC−MS analysis were enriched in KEGG pathways.","Trees grow and develop at the physiological, morphological, and molecular levels as they age. Similar to previous findings on the EOs of O. lanceolata and C. burmannii, tree age had a significant effect on the content of EOs in P. zhennan wood. As the tree ages, the width and volume of its timber will also increase, which will increase the accumulation of EOs within the wood. The main constituents of EOs from the leaves of L. cubeba and C. kanehirae are monoterpenoids. In comparison, the results of the EO analysis of P. bournei were similar to those of our study, in that sesquiterpenoids such as cubebene, guaiol, eudesmol, and cadinene were dominant in the EOs from P. zhennan wood. The major compounds in the bark oil of P. zhennan included calarene and cadinene, while the major compounds in the leaf oil were cadiene, copaene, and eudesmol. The major compounds in the EOs from the old wood of P. zhennan were 1-(3-methylbutyl)-2,3,4,5-tetramet hylbenzene and caroyllene oxide, while the major compounds in the newer wood were γ-cadinene and 1H-cycloprop[e] azulene, decahydro-1,1,7-trimethyl-4-methylene-, [1aR- (1a, α.,4a. β.,7. α.,7b.α.)]. In contrast with the findings of previous studies, 5-aminopentanoic acid, cubebene, and guanidine acetic acid, which were identified via LC−MS analysis, and agarospirol, guaiol, and naphthalene,1,2,3,5,6,8a-hexahydro-4,7-dimethyl-1-(1-methylethyl)-, (1s-cis)- which were identified via GC−MS, were the major compounds in the EOs from P. zhennan wood. A high content of the sesquiterpenoid cubebene has also been reported in Melissa officinalis EOs. This phytochemical polymorphism is significantly determined by genetic factors and environmental variations. The composition of EOs in plants can also be affected by age. Our findings suggested that the main differences among the EOs from wood of differently aged trees in P. zhennan were their constituent compounds and their concentrations. Our results showed that the contents and types of sesquiterpenoids and monoterpenoids in EOs were significantly influenced by tree age. The analysis of wood EO composition showed that most identified compounds had high fluctuations in percentage composition across tree ages. These significant differences in components support the previous argument that the function of EOs is closely related to plant defense against pests or weeds. The studied EOs from wood of differently aged trees displayed different chemical profiles. For instance, the proportions of two sesquiterpenoids (capsidiol and caryophyllene) exhibited contrasting trends among the three tree ages. Additionally, some components were not present in any of the samples. These phenomena were also investigated in Cinnamomum cassia. The variations can be partly explained by the fact that plants with external secretory structures can release secretions with organ maturation due to trichome cuticle disruption, whereas plants with internal secretory structures more often maintain a more stable yield and composition.A pleasant fragrance endows wood with excellent durability and high economic value. Accumulated secondary metabolites in wood are the main substances contributing to wood fragrance. Terpenoids, especially sesquiterpenoids and monoterpenoids, are the main compounds related to the fragrance of wood in many woody plants, such as Chamaecyparis formosensis, Taiwania cryptomerioides, Cryptomeria species, and P. hui. Similar to our previous findings, sesquiterpenoids and monoterpenoids were the main metabolites contributing to the unique fragrance of P. zhennan wood. However, the types of sesquiterpenoids identified in this study are different from those identified in that previous study. For instance, the major sesquiterpenoids epi-γ-eudesmol and agarospirol could not be found in the heartwood of P. zhennan. This may be due to differences in the extraction methods used for VOCs, cultivation environments, and tree ages of wood samples. Agarospirol has been identified in agarwood oil in many reports. In the present investigation, agarospirol was the major compound of VOCs and EOs from P. zhennan wood, similar to the findings in the above report. This result also indicated a close correlation between EOs and VOCs. Previous studies reported that with increasing tree age, the contents of the main components of VOCs from leaves increased gradually. In this study, the relative content and composition of VOCs from wood were significantly affected by tree age. With increasing tree age, the relative content of major VOC components, such as agarospirol, increased gradually, and more new metabolites, such as two sesquiterpenoids (himachalene and 3-cyclohexen-1-ol, 1-(1,5-dimethyl-4-hexenyl)-4-methyl-), were formed in wood from older trees. This indicated that an increasing number of fragrance-related compounds accumulated in trunk wood with increasing tree age in P. zhennan. The above results are related to the formation of heartwood; more fragrance-related compounds were formed and accumulated during heartwood formation, and the proportion of heartwood increased with increasing tree age. Therefore, in the development and utilization of wood in P. zhennan, an appropriate processing technology and product type should be selected based on the variation trend of VOCs, and differentiated development and utilization should be carried out.","The yield and composition of EOs and VOCs in Phoebe zhennan wood greatly differed among trees of different ages. The contents of EOs in the wood varied depending on tree age, and the 30a wood had the highest EO yield. A total of 596 (LC−MS) and 76 (GC−MS) metabolites were identified in the EOs that showed high fluctuations in percentage composition between the different tree ages. Sesquiterpenoids were the main compounds in the EOs, and the relative contents of caryophyllene oxide, eudesmol, carvone, and cubebene in the 30a and 80a wood were greater than those in the 10a wood. The main compounds of wood VOCs were also sesquiterpenoids, of which the major compounds, such as agarospirol and eudesmol, were more highly accumulated in 30a and 80a wood than in 10a wood. In general, the wood of an intermediate age (30a) is suitable for EO production, but older wood of P. zhennan is more suitable for making high-grade wooden furniture because of its remarkable and pleasant fragrance."
71,TA047843,10.1186/s12879-020-05556-9,Antiviral mechanism of carvacrol on HSV-2 infectivity through inhibition ofRIP3-mediated programmed cell necrosis pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome system inBSC-1 cells.,"BACKGROUND: Carvacrol, as the major components of aromatic plants used fortreating human skin diseases including origanum, Satureja, thymus, andcoridothymus species, presented a kind of antiviral activity. To explore themechanisms of carvacrol against herpes simplex virus (HSV) in vitro. METHOD: TheBSC-1 cells model of HSV infection was established, and from the two aspects ofviral replication level and cell death pathway, the antiviral effects ofcarvacrol on HSV infected cells were also evaluated by plaque assay under thethree modes including prevention, treatment, and direct inactivation. RESULTS: Inthe three ways, the half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of 2% truecarvacrol solution on HSV-2 infected cells were severally 0.43, 0.19 and0.51 mmol/L, and the corresponding therapeutic index (TI) were 4.02, 9.11 and3.39, respectively. It's the opposite of the increased levels caused by HSV-2infection, that both the expressions at the transcription genes and proteinlevels of virus own replication key factors (including ICP4, ICP27, VP16, gB, andUL30) and cytokines (including RIP3, TNF-α, and MLKL) of infected cells treatedwith carvacrol were dose-dependently inhibited. Besides, HSV-2 infection cancause the decrease of intracellular protein ubiquitination level, and carvacrolcan reverse the ubiquitination decrease level caused by HSV-2 infection.CONCLUSION: Carvacrol exhibits significant antiviral activity by inhibiting theHSV-2 proliferation process and HSV-2-induced TNF-α increasing levels, decreasingRIP3 and MLKL protein expressions through the intracellular RIP3-mediatedprogrammed cell necrosis pathway. In addition, carvacrol also may exhibitanti-HSV-2 activity by reversing the ubiquitination decrease level caused byHSV-2 infection on the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which provides insights intothe molecular mechanism.","Wang, Li, Wang, Dan, Wu, Xingan, Xu, Rui, Li, Yunlan",2020,BMC infectious diseases,2,False,False,True,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is enveloped, linear and double-stranded DNA virus, which belongs to the family herpesviridae, genus alphaherpesvirinae. It is one of the most common pathogenic agents in humans and divided into two types: HSV-1 and HSV-2. There is increasing awareness of the importance of skin infection disease caused by HSV infection. Several of emerging cases were found continuously in recent years, which indicated an upward trend in HSV incidence. Extensive evidence proved that HSV viruses could typically cause severe afflictions, mainly because of the generation of genital lesions and severe infections like life-threatening encephalitis and disseminated infections in neonates. The HSV is also associated with potentially fatal viral stromal keratitis, an ocular disease, which is a leading cause of cornea-derived blindness in developed countries. Currently, the approved primary anti-HSV therapeutic drugs are acyclovir (ACV) and its derivatives, which interfere with viral DNA synthesis to reduce viral replication and transmission. But all mentioned nucleoside analogs drugs, including ACV, ganciclovir and penciclovir, were oriented on the same molecular mechanisms of action that hinders viral DNA synthesis by competitively inhibiting viral DNA polymerase or adding itself to viral DNA, and the multi-drug resistant HSV viral strains were starting to show up more and more with heavy use of nucleoside analogs agents. Besides, the disadvantages of their narrow antiviral spectrum and high costs gradually also aggravated people’s living burden, extremely in America. For these reasons, there is a need for the development of novel antiherpes drugs which are safe and preferably inexpensive with limiting the primary infection and supporting further treatment.A large number of herbs and aromatic plants are frequently used for treating human skin diseases, especially from the family of Lamiaceae including origanum, satureja, thymus, and coridothymus species. Carvacrol, a monoterpene phenol that is also known as 2-methyl-5-(1- methyl ethyl)-phenol, is one of the significant components of oregano essential oils, and presents a wide diversity of biological activities, such as antiviral, anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Besides, carvacrol also has been identified as a natural, economical food preservative. Currently, the carvacrol-related health products, including 60 soft gels and 60 vegetarian capsules, are available for antioxidant treatments on the market. The relevant literature have also indicated that carvacrol has an safety and tolerability effect on healthy volunteers through a phaseIclinical trial and possible therapeutic effect on asthmatic patients through a phase II clinical trial in recent years. Carvacrol could exert antiviral activity by preventing the death of cells infected with HSV, but the specific mechanism of it against HSV virus has not been reported up to now. As a new alternative energy, carvacrol provides a new possibility for the development of HSV treatment and preventive health care drugs with advantages of great source, safety, low toxicity, and nature.So the purpose of this paper was to explore the antiviral activity of carvacrol against HSV in vitro by plaque assay. The possible mechanisms of carvacrol’s antiviral effect on HSV-2 infected BSC-1 cells were studied from two aspects of viral replication level and cell death pathway through molecular biological techniques, which can provide adequate theoretical supports for the discovery of new antiviral drugs and alternative energy.","Carvacrol (Oregano oil; Purity: 99.8%) and 2% carvacrol true solution, prepared by dissolving 2 mL carvacrol with 33% sulfur-β-paste in distilled water at 100 mL, were kindly provided by prof. S. W from the air force medical university in China. Vero cells and HSV laboratory standard virus strain (HSV-1-F strain and HSV-2-G strain) were kindly gifted by prof. X. A from the air force medical university. BSC-1 cells were kindly donated by prof. Z. Q from Wuhan University. Vero and BSC-1 cells were incubated under Dulbecco-modified eagle’s medium (DMEM, high glucose) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in the atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HSV strains were grown for 3 ~ 4 days on cells in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37, and the virus stock solution was stored at − 80 °C until use. Whereafter, the plaque assay was performed to determinate viral multiplicity of infection (MOI) on cells. Of which, high glucose DMEM medium, FBS and cell counting CCK8 kits were purchased from Shanghai sangon biological engineering co. Ltd. The following antibodies were used: anti-ICP4 polyclonal antibody (Abcam; ab96432), anti-ICP27 monoclonal antibody (Abcam; ab31631), anti-VP16 monoclonal antibody (Abcam; ab110226), anti-gB monoclonal antibody (Abcam; ab6506), anti-Caspase-3 antibody (Abcam; ab 90,437), anti-Ub antibody (Abcam; ab7780), anti-RIP3 (Abcam; ab56164), anti-MLKL antibody (Abcam; ab184718), anti-Caspase-1 (Proteintech; 22,915–1-AP), anti-TNF-α (Proteintech; 60,291–1-lg). Goat anti-rabbit infrared secondary antibody (IR Dye800CW, 926–32,211) and goat anti-mouse infrared secondary (IR Dye680RD; 926–68,070) were purchased from American LICOR biosciences. Secondary antibody binding to Alexa Fluor 488 or Cy3 was purchased from Xi’an Zhuangzhi biotechnology co.Ltd. Fast 1000 total RNA rapid extraction kit, 5 × PrimeScript RT Master Mix (TakaRa), RNase Free dH2O (TakaRa) and TB GreenTM Premix Ex TaqTM II (TakaRa) were obtained from Xi’an kehao biological engineering co. Ltd.Plaque assays were performed with a monolayer culture of Vero and BSC-1 cells in 6-well plates. The cell monolayer was infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 virus stock at multiple dilutions (10− 2, 10− 3, 10− 4, 10− 5, 10− 6, 10–7), respectively, and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 incubator (Thermo HERACELL 150i, America) for 2 h. Cell monolayer infected without HSV-2 virus was used as the blank control. The infected cell monolayer was then overlaid with an overlapping solution containing 2% carboxymethyl -cellulose sodium salt. After 3 ~ 4 days, the cell monolayer was washed three times with PBS and stained with 1% crystal violet solution. Plaques were counted and plaque formation units (PFUs / mL) were calculated as−x / (n × v) × d, where−x, n, v, and d refer to the average numbers of plaques, repetitive holes numbers, viral load and dilution factor, respectively.The HSV-1 and HSV-2 virus solution were respectively added to BSC-1 cell monolayers for 2 h to allow viral attachment. After 2 h’ incubation, the virus solution was replaced with the maintenance media (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS). The cellular state was observed and photographed under an optical microscope (20 × magnification) using visible light (OLYMPUS-CKX31, Japan).The cytotoxicity of carvacrol was determinated by CCK-8 assay. BSC-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured in 10% DMEM for 24 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The medium was then removed and carvacrol (with dose of 1, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025 and 0 mmol/L) and 2% carvacrol real solution (with dose of 4, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, 1, 0.8 and 0 mmol/L) were severally added to individual wells of BSC-1 cells in plates with 3 wells in parallel for each dose and the plates were incubated for 24 h. Cells treated without the carvacrol were used as a control. After that, the supernatant medium of each well was replaced with 100 μL DMEM, and 10 μL CCK-8 solution was added to the cells, and cells were cultured for 4 h avoiding light. The absorbance (A) of each well was measured at 450 nm using BioTek synergy2 microplate reader. The cell viability was calculated using the following formula: Cell viability (%) = (As - Ab) / (Ac - Ab) × 100%, where As and Ac refer to the absorbance in the presence and absence of carvacrol, respectively, and Ab stands for the blank control. Subsequently, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of carvacrol and 2% carvacrol real solution on BSC-1 was automatically calculated using Bliss principle according to the cell viability values obtained above.For treatment assay, the BSC-1 cell monolayer was firstly incubated with HSV-1/2 viruses (MOI = 0.05) at 37 °C for 2 h to allow viral attachment. Following 2 h’ incubation, the carvacrol with different concentrations (1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0 mmol/L) were added to the infected cells for 24 h. After that, the supernatant was replaced with the overlapping solution containing 2% carboxymethyl - cellulose sodium salt and cells were continued to incubate at 37 °C for 3 ~ 4 days. The infected cell monolayer was then strained by plaque assay. The cell monolayer without treatment of carvacrol was used as a virus control group. Plaques were counted and the antiviral activity was calculated as [(VC - VD) / VC] × 100%, where VD and VC refer to the plaques’ number in the presence and absence of carvacrol.For pre-treatment assay, BSC-1 cells monolayer was first treated with carvacrol at the same as above concentrations for 24 h at 37 °C before HSV-1/2 (at MOI = 0.05) with plaque assay. For viral direct inactivation assay, the HSV-1/2 virus supernatant and carvacrol at the same indicated concentrations were added to the cell culture, simultaneously. The infected cell monolayer was co-cultured with virus and carvacrol for 24 h at 37 °C using plaque assay.The antiviral activities of carvacrol and 2% true carvacrol solution against HSV-2 were severally observed by the above three assays of pre-treatment, treatment, and viral direct inactivation according to the above formula, respectively. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of them on HSV-2 infected BSC-1 cells was then calculated and the rapeutic indexes (TI) were further calculated in three modes using the following formula: TI = IC50 / EC50.The time-of-addition assay was performed as described in the literature. Briefly, carvacrol at 0.5 mmol/L concentration was added into cell monolayer at the different time point (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 h) after virus infection (MOI = 0.00025, that is 50PFUs / well). At 24 h post-infection (p.i.), the solution was replaced with the overlapping medium containing 2% carboxymethyl-cellulose sodium salt. The cells were continued to incubate for 3 ~ 4 days and strained for plaque assay.The time-of-removal assay as described. Briefly, carvacrol at 0.5 mmol/L concentration was added into cell monolayer after virus adsorption. At the different post-infection time, the solution was removed, and the overlapping medium was added into cell monolayer, subsequently. Following 3 ~ 4 days’ incubation, the cell monolayer was strained by plaque assay.The BSC-1 cell monolayer was infected with HSV-2 (at MOI = 0.03) for 2 h. Different concentrations of carvacrol (1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0 mmol/L) were added into cells after viral attachment. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the supernatant and cell pellet were collected, respectively. The cell pellet was subjected to freeze-thaw cycles of three times before titration. Virus titers of supernatant and cell pellet were determined by plaque assay, and the virus release rate of carvacrol at different concentrations against HSV-2 was also calculated using the formula: the virus release rate (%) = Tex / (Tex + Tin) × 100%, where Tex and Tin represent extracellular and intracellular virus titer, respectively.For the effect analysis of carvacrol on the expression sites of HSV-2 ICP27 and gB protein, BSC-1 cells were grown on the glass coverslips at a density of 5.0 × 104 cells / well and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS overnight. The indicated concentration of carvacrol was added to the cell monolayer after HSV-2 infection (at MOI = 2). After 24 h incubation, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °Cwith the indicated primary antibody at a dilution of 1: 1000 [including anti-ICP27, anti-gB and anti-RIP3]. Subsequently, alexa fluor 488 or cy3 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody at a dilution of 1: 200 was added into cells for 1 h’ incubation avoiding light. And cells were washed and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at room temperature for 10 min. The coverslips were captured with the fluorescence microscope.For the HSV-2 pivotal proteins and cytokines proteins analysis, a total of 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plate before HSV-2 infection. Infected cells treated with different post-infection time and a different dose of carvacrol were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer for 30 min on the ice. Besides, normal BSC-1 cells, as a control, were also lysed after 24 h’ incubation. The protein supernatants at different treatment groups were collected and quantified using BCA protein quantification kit. After being denatured by boiling, equivalent amounts of protein (40 μg) were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to 0.45 μm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, 619534, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai) membranes, and blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST for 1 h. Then, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 [including anti-ICP4, anti-ICP27, anti-VP16, anti-gB, anti-Caspase-3, anti-Ub, anti-RIP3, anti-MLKL, anti-Caspase-1, anti-TNF-α) at 4°Covernight, followed by infrared fluorescence secondary antibodies with a dilution of 1:10000 (IR Dye800CW goat anti-rabbit antibody, Dye 680RD goat anti-mouse antibody, LICOR, USA). Membrane were visualized using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (model: 9120, LICOR, USA).For the mRNA expression of HSV-2 key genes analysis, total RNA of the infected cells treated with different post-infection time and the different dose of carvacrol was extracted with trizol according to the procedure of fast 1000 total RNA rapid extraction kit and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with 5 × PrimeScript RT Master Mix. Gene expressions were detected by Q-PCR analysis with SYBR Green enzyme amplification program, including preincubation at 95 °C for 30 s and 45 amplification cycles with degeneration at 95 °C for 10 s and anneal at 60 °C for 31 s. The melting curves of each gene was analyzed by Roche instrument operation instructions. The products of ICP4, ICP27, VP16, gB, and GAPDH were separated on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and amplification fragments of each gene were observed and photographed. The sequence of primers used in PCR analysis was shown in Table 1. All experiments were repeated three times. All calculations, including IC50, EC50, t-test, were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad company, USA). Student’s t-test was used to compare the treatment groups with the control and determine the statistical significance. Significant differences were indicated by p-value (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001).The working datasets for statistical analysis in the current study are available from the first author and corresponding author on reasonable request.Cell and virus were studied so there was no ethics issue on this paper.Not applicable.","It’s well known that Vero cells have been used as one of the HSV susceptible cell lines. To clarify whether BSC-1 cells can be infected with the HSV virus, the viral titer of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 were compared on the different cell lines: Vero and BSC-1 cells.As shown in Fig. 1, the plaque formation numbers of HSV-1 at 10− 3 dilutions on Vero and BSC-1 cells (Fig. 1a and b) were twenty-nine and ninety-five, respectively. At 10− 6 dilutions of HSV-2 (Fig. 1c and d), the plauqe numbers on Vero and BSC-1 were eleven and twenty-one, respectively. So the viral titers of HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells were 3.2 × 104 and 1.2 × 107 PFUs/mL, while the viral titers on BSC-1 cells were 1.1 × 105 PFUs/mL and 2.3 × 107 PFUs/mL, respectively. It was observed (from Fig. 1) that the viral infection titers of HSV-1 and HSV-2 on BSC-1 cells were higher than that of Vero. Therefore, the BSC-1 cell model of HSV infection was established in this study. The cellular morphology can be seen from Fig. 1. Normal BSC-1 cells were arranged tightly with uniform tadpole-like morphology and intact cytomembrane, and the cell membranes were clearly visible with a strong refractive index (Fig. 1e). However, BSC-1 cells became round, swollen and partially fell off after HSV-1 infection for 24 h (Fig. 1f). The cell membranes of HSV-2 infected cells were blurred, and multiple cells were gradually merged to form a multinucleated giant cell (Fig. 1g), which shed off to appear vacuoles with HSV-2 post-infection time rising to 30 h (Fig. 1h).To evaluate the usabilities of carvacrol and 2% carvacrol real solution, their cytotoxicity was determined using CCK-8 cell counting kit. Cellular survival curves presented in Fig. 1 clearly shown that the logIC50 value of carvacrol (Fig. 1i) and 2% carvacrol real solution (Fig. 1j) on BSC-1 cells were − 0.3073 and 0.2378, so the corresponding IC50 value is calculated as 0.49 and 1.73 mmol/L, respectively. So the cytotoxicity of 2% carvacrol real solution was lower than that of carvacrol. So, 2% carvacrol real solution was used for further studying the mechanism of Carvacrol on HSV infectivity.In this study, plaque assay was used to compare the anti-HSV-1 and anti-HSV-2 viral activities of carvacrol in three ways of pre-treatment, treatment, and direct inactivation. As shown in Fig. 1k, carvacrol at different doses showed inconsistent and unstable inhibitory effect on the virus titer of HSV-1. However, it can dose-dependently reduce the virus titer of HSV-2 with a consistent downward trend and a significant difference in the above three ways (Fig. 1l). Therefore, the antiviral activity and mechanism of carvacrol against HSV-2 in vitro were selected for further study.In this study, the dose-response curves of carvacrol and 2% true carvacrol solution against HSV-2 were obtained in Fig. 2, respectively. The corresponding EC50 and TI were calculated by the formula above. Under three modes of pre-treatment (Fig. 2A(a)), treatment (Fig. 2B(b)) and viral direct inactivation (Fig. 2C(c)), the EC50 value of carvacrol on HSV-2 infected cells were 0.09, 0.10 and 0.07 mmol/L, and the corresponding TI were 5.44, 4.90 and 7.00, respectively. However, the EC50 value of 2% true carvacrol solution against HSV-2 in the three ways (Fig. 2D(a), 2E(b) and 2F(c)) were 0.43, 0.19 and 0.51 mmol/L, and its corresponding TI were 4.02, 9.11 and 3.39, respectively. So both the carvacrol and 2% true carvacrol solution can provide variously antiviral effects for pre-treatment, treatment and direct inactivation modes of HSV-2 infection. To determine whether carvacrol could have an effect on virus release, the extracellular and intracellular viral titer in the presence and absence of carvacrol were compared. As shown in Fig. 2g, when 0.0625 mmol/L carvacrol was applied to HSV-2 infected cells, the viral titer of culture supernatant was significantly decreased and the inhibition rate of carvacrol against HSV-2 was 30% (4.28 logPFUs/mL vs 6.15 logPFUs/mL), while the intracellular virus titer can be slightly attenuated (4.48 logPFUs /mL vs 5.46 logPFUs/mL; the inhibition rate was only 18%). As shown in Fig. 2h, the HSV-2 virus release rate was gradually decreased with 1 mmol/L carvacrol. According to the formula of viral release rate, the viral release rate of HSV-2 was significantly reduced to 33.67 ± 2.05% at 1 mmol/L carvacrol.The time-of-addition and time-of-removal assays were performed to determine the antiviral activity of carvacrol for HSV-2 at different replication stage.As shown in Fig. 2i, the HSV-2 titer was 12 PFUs/well when carvacrol was added into cell monolayer immediately after HSV-2 infection (that is 0 point of addition, cells were treated with carvacrol 24 h), while the HSV-2 titer was 34 PFUs/well when carvacrol was immediately removed on cell monolayer treated with HSV-2 infection and carvacrol (that is 0 point of removal, cells were only treated with carvacrol 0 h). Compared with the addition of carvacrol (0.5 mmol/L) at 12 h for infected cells (HSV-2 MOI = 0.00025), The addition of carvacrol at 9 h can significantly reduce HSV-2 virus titer (33 PFUs/well, 12 h vs 11 PFUs/well, 9 h). The removal of carvacrol at 9 h resulted in a significant decrease for HSV-2 infection titer compared to 6 h (12 PFUs/well, 9 h vs 31 PFUs/well, 6 h), and the viral titer was gradually decreased as the carvacrol’s removal time was prolonged. These data suggested that the antiviral activity of carvacrol was related to the time of its addition or removal after a viral infection, and it can significantly affect HSV-2 replication between 6 h and 12 h post-infection time.Numerous evidence has shown that HSV immediate early (IE) genes play an important role in subsequent viral early protein expression. There are five IE genes: ICP0, ICP4, ICP22, ICP27, and ICP47. Of which, ICP27 is a multifunctional regulatory protein required for viral replication and could activate other early or late viral genes expression. The glycoprotein B (gB) on the HSV is a late-stage protein, which can promote viral adhesion for cells and accelerate the fusion of infected cells. As visible by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, cells infected with HSV-2 exhibit distinct cytopathic effect with the character of nucleus aggregation.Meanwhile, through immuno-fluorescence staining, the ICP27 and gB protein expression of HSV-2 were mainly located in the nucleus (green fluorescence, Supplement Fig 1A) and cytoplasm (red fluorescence, Supplement Fig 1B) of infected cells, respectively. And as shown in Supplement Fig. 1, the expression levels of both ICP27 and gB were negatively correlated with the dose of carvacrol.At previous experiments, it was shown that carvacrol has good anti-HSV-2 activity on infected cells. Here, real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) and western blot were used to detect the molecular expression levels of HSV-2 virus-associated factors, including ICP4, ICP27, VP16, gB and UL30 of infected cells treated with different post-infection time and different doses of carvacrol.Firstly, PCR electrophoresis and melting curves analysis were used to demonstrate the specificity and feasibility of designed primers in the corresponding gene. As shown in Supplement Fig 1C, agarose gel electrophoresis results of ICP4, ICP27, VP16, gB, and UL30 gene indicated that the amplification fragment of each gene was complete and single without specific bands appearing. And the melting curves of each gene presented a single peak (Supplement Fig. 1D-H ), which indicated that there was no primer dimer.Besides, the expressions of each gene (such as HSV-2 ICP4, ICP27, VP16, gB and UL30, and so on) at the levels of transcription genes (Fig. 3a-e) and protein (Fig. 3f, g) were gradually increased with the prolongation of HSV-2 infection time. But, these factors’ expressions levels of infected HSV-2 cells treated carvacrol for 24 h were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Therefore, carvacrol may be play an antiviral activity by inhibiting the synthesis of HSV-2 key replicator genes. Compared with the normal cell group (Fig. 4a, b, c), the expression level of HSV-2 gB protein in the lesion fusion site of infected cell was higher (red fluorescence, Fig. 4f), and the RIP3 protein expression can be also seen at the same site by immunofluorescence staining (green fluorescence, Fig. 4e), so HSV-2 may be initiate intracellular RIP3-mediated pro-grammed cell necrosis pathway, when HSV-2 infection induced multiple cell fusion to form polynuclear giant cells. Firstly, it’s observed that the gene expression level of RIP3 in HSV-2 infected cells was time-dependently increased by Q-PCR (Fig. 4g-j).Compared with the control group, the gene expression level of RIP3 at HSV-2 post-infection 24 h was significantly increased by 3.73 ± 0.05 times, then, its expression treated with carvacrol was significantly decreased with the dose rising (Fig. 4g). Expected, western blot results (Fig. 4k) showed that RIP3 protein expression level was positively correlated with HSV-2 post-infection time. And the relative protein expression of RIP3 was increased by 1.47 ± 0.17 times at HSV-2 post-infection 12 h (p<0.05). However, its expression increased level caused by HSV-2 infection was significantly inhibited (p<0.05) at 0.5 mmol/L carvacrol (Fig. 4n).Besides, the relative molecular expressions level of upstream factors (TNF-α, TNF-R1) and downstream factors (MLKL) in RIP3-mediated programmed cell necrosis pathway were further evaluated at infected cells treated with the different post-infection time of HSV-2 and different carvacrol concentrations by Q-PCR and western blot assays. As shown in Fig. 4, with the prolongation of HSV-2 infection time, both the gene (Fig. 4h and j) and protein expressions (Fig. 4l and m) levels of TNF-α and MLKL were increased, but the expressions of TNF-R1 were not affected (Fig. 4i). At 24 h post-infection time, the transcriptional gene expression levels of TNF-α and MLKL were significantly increased by 5.65 ± 0.24 and 1.90 ± 0.38 times (p<0.01; p<0.05), respectively. Their protein expression was also significantly elevated, compared with cells untreated with HSV-2 infection. However, when the HSV-2 infected cells were treated with different doses of carvacrol for 24 h, the gene (Fig. 4h and j) and protein (Fig. 4o and p) expressions levels of TNF-α and MLKL were decreased to some extent, but the expressions of TNF-R1 were not affected compared with the virus control group (Fig. 4i). Of which, the gene expressions of TNF-α and MLKL in infected cells treated with 0.25 mmol/L carvacrol were significantly reduced to 0.57 ± 0.02 and 0.76 ± 0.04 times of the viral group (Fig. 4h and j), respectively. And the protein expression of TNF-α in infected cells treated with 0.125 mmol/L carvacrol was also decreased to 0.62 ± 0.09 times with a significant difference (Fig. 4o). Until the concentration of carvacrol rising to 1 mmol/L, the protein expression of MLKL was significantly weakened (Fig. 4p).Through synthesis analysis on transcriptional gene and protein levels of RIP3, TNF-α, MLKL, and TNF-R1, HSV-2 infection might be initiate intracellular RIP3-mediated cell necrosis pathway by inducing intracellular TNF-α expression, activating RIP3 protein and promoting MLKL expression. When carvacrol was applied on infected cells, it may exhibit anti-HSV-2 activity by inhibiting HSV-2-induced TNF-α increased levels, decreasing RIP3 protein activity and weakening MLKL protein expression.The ubiquitin-proteasome system is another type of protein degradation pathway used to maintain homeostasis in the body. The virus could complete its life cycle by regulating the ubiquitination (Ub) of relevant proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, the Ub level of proteins in infected cells was reduced to 47.16 ± 0.17% at HSV-2 post-infection 36 h compared with the normal group (0.69 ± 0.19 vs 1.33 ± 0.06). On the contrary, when carvacrol at 0.5 mmol/L was applied to infected cells, the Ub level of the large molecular weight protein was increased to 3.03 ± 0.74 times of the virus control group, and there was a significant difference (p < 0.01). Therefore, HSV-2 infection could cause a decrease of intracellular protein ubiquitination level, and carvacrol can reverse the ubiquitination decrease caused by HSV-2 infection. ","HSV proliferation can be accomplished by multiple processes of its adsorption, drilling, shelling, biosynthesis, assembly and release. In the natural environment, the main host of HSV infection is human, but it has a full susceptibility to infect cells in the laboratory environment. Previous literatures have shown that HSV-2 infection models in vitro can be established on various cell lines, such as human embryonic lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (HEC-1-A), human cervical cancer cells (Hela), human lung cancer cells (A549), African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), and milk hamster kidney cells (BHK). Among them, Vero cells are classic cell lines for virus amplification. The growth of Vero cell is rapid and density-dependent, which might easily lead to cell stack growth. The state of cell growth is inconvenient for the exploration of the possible mechanism of carvacrol against HSV. Hence, it is necessary to find an alternative susceptible cell line for HSV infection. BSC-1 is a monkey kidney cell line, but it has a slow proliferation, and isn’t easy to stack growth, which can eliminate some interference factors for the study of the antiviral mechanism of carvacrol against HSV-1/2. In this study, the plaque assay was used to screen infected cell lines of HSV, and the results showed that BSC-1 cells could be infected with HSV, and the infection efficiency on the BSC-1 cells is higher than that of Vero cells. Therefore, BSC-1 cells could be used as a susceptible cell line for HSV infection.In the three ways of pre-treatment, treatment and direct inactivation virus, both carvacrol and 2% true carvacrol solution could exert an individual antiviral activity on the infected HSV-2 cells by plaque assay, and their antiviral activities depend on the dosage form of carvacrol. Based on the analysis of EC50 and TI, 2% true carvacrol solution had an EC50 value higher than that of carvacrol on HSV-2 infected cells under the three modes. However, since the IC50 value of the former was higher than the latter, the TI of 2% true carvacrol solution was less than carvacrol in the two ways of pre-treatment and direct inactivation virus. So the safety of carvacrol is higher than that of the 2% true carvacrol solution in both modes, which makes it possible to develop carvacrol as preventive health products in the future. In the way of treatment, the TI value of 2% true carvacrol solution was higher than carvacrol, so the former was safer than the latter, which provided a theoretical basis for the development and utilization of 2% true carvacrol solution as a liquors.HSV-2 is a relatively complex virus particle consisting of three parts: capsid, cortex, and envelope. And the surface of the envelope contains multiple protrusions. Rapidly, HSV-2 proliferates, with a replication cycle of approximately 8 ~ 16 h. During replication of the virus, the HSV-2 gene can be divided into immediate early genes, early genes, and late genes according to the chronological order of gene transcription and translation. There are five IE genes: ICP0, ICP4, ICP22, ICP27, and ICP47. Of which, ICP4 is an critical regulatory protein in HSV-2 replication, and ICP4 and ICP27 were used as immediate early regulatory proteins to initiate transcription and translation of early genes, which play an essential role in viral replication and cell growth. The HSV virus capsid contains many capsid protein VP16, which entered the cellular nucleus and bound to the viral DNA to activate the expression of the early viral gene after the virus invaded the cells. The gB on the HSV capsule envelope is a late-stage protein, which can promote viral adhesion for cells and accelerate the fusion of infected cells. Besides, the protein encoded by the HSV-2 UL30 gene is one of the subunits on the DNA polymerase and is critical for viral DNA synthesis. It was found by plaque assay that carvacrol could decrease the HSV-2 virus titer; immunofluorescence staining results indicated that carvacrol could attenuate the expression of HSV-2 ICP27 and gB protein on spatial epitopes; Q-PCR results indicated carvacrol could inhibit the replication of HSV-2 virus at the transcription gene level. The western blot assay indicated that the carvacrol inhibited the vital proteins expressions of ICP4, ICP27, VP16 and gB in HSV-2 replication from the linear degree of the protein. According to the above comprehensive data, the antiviral activity of carvacrol on infected cells is closely related to the replication process of HSV-2.It is known that the protein encoded by HSV-2 UL30 gene is one of the subunits of viral DNA polymerase and participates in the viral replication process. Therefore, a small part of the experiments in this study was performed to detect the effect of carvacrol on the expression of HSV-2 UL30 gene and to elucidate further whether carvacrol might inhibit the replication of viral DNA by inhibiting UL30 subunit on DNA polymerase. The results (Fig. 3e) showed that the expression of UL30 gene was gradually increased with the HSV-2 post-infection time rising. When carvacrol was administered to infected cells, the expression level of UL30 was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, which means that the anti-HSV-2 activity of carvacrol may be related to the replication process of viral DNA by interfering with UL30 subunit on DNA polymerase.To a certain extent, the HSV viruses could escape cellular defense mechanisms, such as HSV-2, which can establish latent infection in the human body. In the cell infection model test in vitro, it was observed that the infected cells were gradually fell off and died with the prolongation of HSV-2 post-infection time. At present, cell death pathways mainly include autophagy, apoptosis, pyroptosis, and RIP3-mediated programmed cell necrosis pathways. And it has been reported that viral infection is closely related to the above cell death pathways.In this study, it was founded that HSV-2 infection may cause the death of infected cell through RIP3-mediated programmed cell necrosis pathway, but this kind of death had nothing to do with autophagy, apoptosis, and pyroptosis. As shown in Fig. 6, the main relative protein expression levels of autophagy key factors (LC3, p62, Fig. 6a and b), apoptosis-executing factor (Caspase-3, Fig. 6c) and pyroptosis factor (Caspase-1, Fig. 6d) in HSV-2 infected cells were not affected, and the TUNEL apoptosis assay showed that the DNA of the HSV-2 infected cells wasn’t broken compared with the positive control group (Fig. 6e-h). All mentioned above, carvacrol treatment could induce the RIP3 programmed cell necrosis pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway on HSV-2 infected cells. As shown in Fig. 7a, HSV-2 infected cells can increase the expression of TNF-α. Subsequently, protein complex I was formed by the binding of TNF-α and its receptor TNF-R1 with the participation of other factors, which in turn initiated the formation of cell death complex II to transmit a death signal. And then, intracellular RIP3-mediated programmed cell necrosis pathway was further initiated by promoting MLKL phosphorylation. But when carvacrol was applied to the infected cells, it may exhibit anti-HSV-2 activity by inhibiting HSV-2-induced TNF-α increased levels, decreasing RIP3 protein activity and weakening MLKL protein expression. The ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation system is that (shown in Fig. 7b) ubiquitin was successively catalyzed by ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-binding enzyme (E2) and ubiquitin ligase (E3), and was bound to the specific lysine of the protein to be degraded. Then, the ubiquitin-target protein is recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome. Subsequently, the ubiquitin is re-released by the cleavage action of deubiquitinating enzymes and recycledfor the degradation process of the target protein. Our experimental research found HSV-2 infected cells could cause the decrease of intracellular protein ubiquitination level, thereby, hindering protein degradation and destorying the intracellular proteic dynamic balance to cause passive death of cells. When carvacrol is applied to infected cells, it could reverse the ubiquitination decrease level caused by HSV-2 infection and accelerate the degradation of the target protein. So it is speculated that the antiviral activity of carvacrol on infected cells may be related to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, however, the specific mechanism that how to influence this system still needs further research and explanation in the future. In our research, antiviral mechanism of carvacrol on HSV-2 infectivity through inhibition of RIP3-mediated programmed cell necrosis pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome system in BSC-1 cells was study detailedly in vitro the cell line model. In the general population, adult seropositivity rates approach 20–25% for HSV-2. The viruses cause significant morbidity, primarily as genital lesion. At present, the model of HSV-2 infection on primary cell culture model from human reproductive tract tissues has been successfully established. Finally, these finding will have to be further confirmed in the actual primary cells model or animal models.","In this paper, the antiviral activity and mechanism of carvacrol against herpes simplex virus were investigated in vitro. The anti-HSV activity experiments indicated that the dose-dependent inhibitory activity of carvacrol against HSV-2 was more prominent than that against HSV-1 on the BSC-1 cell model of HSV infection. Both the carvacrol and 2% true carvacrol solution can provide antiviral effects for pre-treatment, treatment and direct inactivation of HSV-2 infection, and carvacrol may exert a good anti-HSV-2 activity in vitro through inhibiting the release process of HSV-2 from intracellular to culture supernatant. At the level of virus replication, carvacrol can significantly inhibit viral replication within 6 ~ 12 h, and inhibit the transcriptional gene and protein expressions levels of ICP4, ICP27, VP16, and gB. Besides, it also can inhibit the formation of the subunit on the DNA polymerase - the UL30 encoding protein, so it may exert antiviral activity by inhibiting the HSV-2 proliferation process. When HSV-2 infection induces multiple cell fusion to form polynuclear giant cells, HSV-2 can initiate intracellular RIP3-mediated programmed cell necrosis pathway by inducing intracellular TNF-α expression, activating RIP3 protein and promoting MLKL expression. When carvacrol was applied on infected cells, it may exhibit anti-HSV-2 activity by inhibiting HSV-2-induced TNF-α increased levels, decreasing RIP3 protein activity and weakening MLKL protein expression. Besides, carvacrol also may exhibit anti-HSV-2 activity by reversing the ubiquitination decrease level caused by HSV-2 infection on the ubiquitin-proteasome system."

These metabolites are widely distributed in plants, contributing to the flavour and/or aroma of flowers and fruits (i.e. β-cyclocitral, α- and β-damascenone, geranial, genaryl acetone, and β-ionone). In Bixa orellana an orange-red apocarotenoid known as bixin is accumulated in high concentrations, mainly on its seeds, and accounts for 80% of the total carotenoids present in the seeds. A bixin biosynthesis pathway has been documented in a heterologous system; the authors identified three B. orellana genes encoding three enzymes required for bixin synthesis from the linear C40 lycopene: lycopene cleavage dioxygenase (BoLCD); bixin aldehyde dehydrogenase (BoBADH); and norbixin methyltransferase (BoBMT). However, seed extracts contain a wide variety of apocarotenoids including both linear apocarotenoids [i.e. methyl (9Z)-apo-8′-lycopenoate] and cyclic apocarotenoids [i.e. methyl (all-E)-8′-apo-β-caroten-8′-oate]. Nevertheless, apocarotenoid profiles in non-seed tissues and their accumulation patterns during different plant developmental stages remain to be clarified.Although apocarotenoid formation can also occur via non-specific oxidation, biologically active forms with regulatory functions tend to be generated via site-specific cleavage. Several enzymes mediating the site-specific carotenoid cleavage are needed to generate biologically active apocarotenoids. On the basis of the substrates identified and their presumed mechanism of catalysis, these enzymes are referred to as carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs). The CCD family is ancient, with a large number of family members present in bacteria, animals, and plants. In Arabidopsis, the CCD enzyme family consists of nine members, which are further divided into two subfamilies: five 9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs) and four CCDs. The NCEDs are involved in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) whereas CCDs are involved in the cleavage of carotenoids in several sites to generate multiple apocarotenoid products. CCDs are only distantly related to the NCEDs, and their substrate specificities and activities differ from those of the NCEDs. Of the four CCD members in Arabidopsis, two CCD enzymes, now known as CCD7 and CCD8, produce a type of apocarotenoid that belongs to a novel class of plant hormones involved in shoot branching, strigolactones,. The function(s) of the remaining two, CCD4 and CCD1, appear to be related to specific carotenoids involved with colour, flavour, and aroma of fruits and flowers of many plant species. In particular, plant CCD1s cleave numerous cyclic and linear all-trans-carotenoids (C5–C6, C7–C8, and C9–C10 double bonds) producing multiple apocarotenoid products.In this study, a cDNA coding for a new member of the CCD family (BoCCD1) in B. orellana was isolated. The putative BoCCD1 open reading frame (ORF) sequence differs from the CCD isolated in this plant and shares a high homology with other plant CCD1s involved with the formation apocarotenoids. The mRNA expression of this new CCD1 member, BoCCD1, in B. orellana was documented during several plant development stages and during seed formation. The BoCCD1 expression pattern was correlated with carotenoid accumulation in this plant (mainly bixin). In situ hybridization methodology was used for the first time in this plant to investigate the expression of BoCCD1 and pigment accumulation in different tissues of B. orellana.","Leaves, floral buds, open flowers, immature fruits of 30 d post-anthesis, and immature and mature seeds (from mature and dehiscent fruit collected 60 d post-anthesis) were harvested from B. orellana plants cultivated at a commercial plantation in Chicxulub, Yucatán, México. Additionally, immature fruits from six different developmental stages were selected on the basis of the width and height of their valves (1.5×1.5 cm, 2×2.5 cm, 2.5×2.5 cm, 3.5×4 cm, 4.5×5 cm, and 5× 4.5 cm) and harvested to obtain immature seeds of six different stages of maturity. All tissues were obtained from a B. orellana variant with pink flowers and high pigment contents charaterized by. In addition, 30-day-old B. orellana plantlets were obtained by germination of pre-treated seeds, as described by, and leaves, stalk, and roots were collected. Samples were immediately frozen by immersion in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C until analysis. For in situ RT-PCR analysis and pigment localization, fresh tissues were cut into small pieces and immersed in 5 vols of AMBION® RNA Later solution (Applied Biosystems Inc., CA, USA). The fixed samples were kept at 4 °C prior to embedding and sectioning.Total carotenoids were measured using spectrophotometric analysis, by extracting pigments from 10 mg of freeze-dried tissues ground with an electronic grinder, followed by adding 5 ml of ice-cold chloroform in semi-darkness in an ice water bath.Each mixture was shaken vigorously for 3 min and was filtered through a nylon membrane (0.45 μm pore size). Subsequently, 50 μl of each extract was adjusted to 3 ml with chloroform and then measured with a DU 650 Beckman-Coulter spectrophotometer. Absorption spectra were obtained at a wavelength range of 404–480 nm and carotenoid content was calculated using the equation reported by.For chromatographic [high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)] analysis of carotenoid and apocarotenoid compounds, 10 mg of freeze-dried tissues in chloroform were dried with nitrogen gas to remove the solvent and then dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile/methanol/isopropanol mixture (75:10:15 v/v/v). Samples were homogenized, centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were filtered through a PVDF membrane (0.22 μm pore size). A 20 μl aliquot of the sample was injected into a Hypersil ODS C-18 reverse phase column (250 mm×4.6 mm; 5 μm bead diameter) and analytes were separated by HPLC. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A [acetonitrile/methanol/isopropanol (75:10:15 v/v/v)] and solvent B [tetrahydrofuran (THF)], and chromatographic separation was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 as follows: step 1, 100% solvent A at injection, for 40 min; step 2, linear increase to 100% solvent B in 4 min; step 3, return to 100% solvent A in 5 min. Commercial standards from Sigma, lycopene, β-carotene, ABA, and bixin were used. All reagents used were HPLC grade and three replicates for each sample were carried out for both extraction and HPLC analysis.Individual carotenoids and apocarotenoids were identified based on their column retention times, and their concentrations were calculated from specific peak area relative to a standard curve. Both HPLC and spectrophotometric data represented the mean of three replicates ±SE.For pigment distribution in plant tissues, fresh tissue samples were fixed with 4% neutral, buffered formalin and embedded in 5% melted agarose. Agarose blocks were mounted in wooden holders and sectioned transversely (30–40 μm slice thickness) with a microtome (Microm GmbH, mod. HM340E, Lab Tech). The agarose was eliminated from the tissue sections by rinsing with RNase-free water. The sections were subsequently stained using the periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining method. Fresh and stained sections were observed with a light transmission microscope for general morphology and pigment tissue localization. Photographs were taken using an Axiocam digital camera coupled to a microscope, and analysed by Axiovision-associated software.Total RNA was obtained from immature seeds using the method previously reported by, and the cDNA population was obtained by a reverse transcriptase reaction. BoCCD1 partial cDNA was amplified by PCR with degenerate primers (Fw1CCD, 5′-TGGTTYGAYGGNGAYGGNATG-3′; and Rv1CCD, 5′-GTDATNGCRAARTCRTGCATCAT-3′). This amplification was performed by conventional PCR in 50 μl (35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1.5 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min, and 45 s extension at 72 °C). For this first primer set, conserved sequences were identified by the alignment of several dioxygenases reported for plant CCD orthologous genes. To obtain a full BoCCD1 cDNA a 5′–3′ RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used. To isolate the 3′ and 5′ends, gene-specific primers Fw2CCD, 5′-TGGTTTTATGCACGATCCAGTGCCG-3′; and Rv2CCD, 5′-GGGTTTGTCACCCTCGTTAAGTGCCA-3′ were designed using the partial BoCCD1 cDNA (540 bp). This reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). PCR products of 3′ and 5′ RACE were purified using the Promega Wizard PCR Preps Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and cloned using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The cloned inserts were subsequently sequenced in an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM™ 3700), and on an ABI 3730×1 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) by Macrogen Inc. (South Korea). Resulting ORF sequences were compared with the GenBank protein database using the Basic Local Alignment Sequence Tool (BLAST; National Center for Biotechnology Information), and domain homology was confirmed with the CLUSTALW2 tool (http://dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu:9331/multialign). Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the MEGA 4.1 program using the Neighbor–Joining (NJ) method. The reliability of the clusters was evaluated by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates.Total RNA was obtained using the method previously reported by, and the cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for the RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After reverse transcription, the BoCCD1 transcript was amplified by PCR with 30 cycles and with specific primers (Fw:BoCCD1, 5′-ATGCAAGTCGAACCAACCAGGGGGATC-3′; Rv:BoCCD1, 5′-TGCCTGGTTCAGCAGATCCTTGTC-3′), designed from cloned BoCCD1 cDNA reported in this study (EF493214). A parallel reaction with 25 cycles and specific primers for the 18S rRNA gene (5'-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3' and 5′-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT-3′, AF206868) was run as an expression control for each PCR. Replicates of each PCR were carried out to confirm the results. BoCCD1 expression relative to the 18S rRNA gene was assessed using a Bio-Image Analyzer GS25 (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Preliminary PCR products were sequenced to verify their identity in all cases.Fresh samples fixed as described above were rinsed three times for 10 min in a mixture of ethanol:acetic acid:water (63:5:32 v/v/v) and once more with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were then embedded in 5% melted agarose (in 1× PBS). Sample blocks were mounted in wooden holders and sliced in a microtome (Microm GmbH Type HM 340E). Sections (30–40 μm thickness) were rinsed with RNase-free water and incubated for 1 h with DNase (1 U ml−1 at 37 °C; Invitrogen). RT-PCRs were performed with a ‘One Step RT/PCR reaction kit’ (Invitrogen) using 0.1 μM of specific BoCCD1 primers and 15 μM digoxigenin (DIG)-dUTP. DIG-labelled PCR products were detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-DIG antibodies and alkaline phosphatase reaction with NBT/BCIP (Roche, USA). As negative controls, DNase-treated sections were incubated with RNase solution immediately before reverse transcription. In addition, in situ RT-PCR analysis was performed with β-actin-specific primers as positive controls. Digital images of the samples were captured with a Leica DFC320 digital camera adapted to the Leica MZFL III stereoscopic microscope and were processed using Leica IM 50 software.","Pigment quantification for different plantlet and adult tissues of B. orellana showed a large amount of variation in the accumulation of different carotenoids. Bixin was the most abundant apocarotenoid observed in both immature and mature seeds (Table 1). The concentrations of bixin seem to change according to the developmental stage of the seeds, continuously increasing during their development until the seed reaches its maximum size (Table 1). Although bixin has been widely reported in the mature seeds of B. orellana, the presence of this pigment in different tissues of B. orellana has not been documented before. In this study, HPLC data indicated that bixin was present in all of the tissues analysed, with the highest amounts in immature and mature seeds. The lowest quantities of bixin were registered in the plantlet root and green fruit of adult plants (Table 1). Other carotenes, such as β-carotene and lycopene, and the apocarotene ABA were also measured in order to understand their relative roles in bixin synthesis (Table 1). As expected, young and adult plant leaves accumulated important amounts of β-carotene (5–15 mg DW g−1), since it is involved in the photosynthetic apparatus. However, β-carotene was not detected in other organs (Table 1). Lycopene, the precursor of several carotenoids, was not detected in samples analysed in this study, probably suggesting a rapid turnover of this compound into the carotenoid biosynthetic pathways. Finally, ABA was abundant during seed development, with values ranging from 0.4 mg DW g−1 to 1.22 mg DW g−1, and in green tissues such as leaves and green fruits (Table 1). Vegetative organs and flowers accumulated high amounts of carotenoids in their tissues (Table 1).Both fresh and PAS/Alcian blue-stained preparations of B. orellana tissues showed the presence of bixin in specific cells. In the root apex (Fig. 1A), bixin was detected in pericycle cells, which are located between the vascular pith and endodermis. In addition, in plantlet roots, bixin was mainly accumulated in the cortex (Fig. 1B–D). Oily droplets of pigments, larger than starch grains accumulated in cells of root tissues, were observed in the cytosol (Fig. 1C, D). Higher accumulation of bixin was observed in plant stalks, where it was only accumulated in collenchyma cells in the stem cortex (Fig. 1E–H). In immature seeds, bixin was detected in aril cells, observed as oily inclusions contained in a thin cell layer covering the seed surface (Fig. 1I–L). Pigment inclusions were distributed throughout the aril layer (Fig. 1J), over a palisade-like cell layer covering the endosperm tissue (Fig. 1K). It was observed that in mature aril cells, bixin occupied the whole cell volume (Fig. 1J), suggesting that mature aril cells are used for pigment storage and lose their biosynthetic functions. Based on this, mature seeds were not viable for further molecular studies. Finally, stereoscopic observations of the leaf abaxial surface showed specific bixin accumulation in cell patches uniformly distributed across each leaf (Fig. 1M, N). Histological tissue samples of the plantlet leaves showed the accumulation of bixin droplets in the spongy mesophyll cells (Fig. 1O, P).The BoCCD1 cDNA sequence showed high identity with CCD protein sequences available in GenBank (Fig. 2). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the NJ method (Fig. 2), showing a short distance of 0.01 with reference to other plant CCD1 genes. The amino acid sequence also reflected the presence of a conserved domain (RPE65), which is characteristic of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of apocarotenoids. A graphic scheme showing the conformation and the sites of the sequence isolated coding for the RPE65 domain described is presented in Fig. 2. This bioinformatics analysis shows at least three CCD members isolated in this plant (BoCCD1, BoCCD, and BoLCD). In addition, a high stringency Southern blot analysis was conducted to detect the gene copy number likely to be encoding a CCD. In all the experiments at least five fragments sharing homology with BoCCD1 were detected, suggesting the presence of a multigene family of CCDs in this plant (data not shown). It is important to mention that the BoCCD1 isolated in this study exhibits identity with another CCD (BoCCD) previously isolated in B. orellana (AJ549819).BoCCD1 mRNA expression was evaluated in vegetative organs (young and mature leaves, stems, and roots) and in reproductive tissues (flower bud, flower, immature fruit, and seeds in different developmental stages) by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3). Adult and plantlet leaves, flower buds, and immature seeds exhibited a high expression of the BoCCD1 gene and, to a lesser degree, in flower, immature fruit, and mature seeds (Fig. 3B, F). A more detailed analysis was carried out in order to obtain information concerning how the BoCCD1 expression profile could be related to bixin accumulation in immature seeds. BoCCD1 expression increased throughout seed maturation, reaching maximum levels at stage 6 of the immature seeds (Fig. 3D). After seed maturation and desiccation, BoCCD1 expression was weak (Fig. 3B). Plantlet root and stalk showed a lower expression of this gene, while in the leaves BoCCD1 mRNA was up-regulated (Fig. 3F).An in situ RT-PCR assay was carried out in the tissues where apocarotenoid production was observed, with the aim of identifying the location of the BoCCD1 mRNA. First the carotenoid content and distribution between different tissues and cellular types were assessed. Seeds and several other tissues with elevated amounts of apocarotenoids were chosen to analyse the presence of this gene in detail in several specific cells. In seeds, the BoCCD1 probe was detected in the layer of oily cells located immediately below the aril (Fig. 4B) and in a high number of cells located in the aril layer adjacent to bixin deposits (Fig. 4F); however, it was not detected in the endosperm of the seeds (Fig. 4B). This suggests that the BoCCD1 gene could be involved with apocarotenoid production, specifically bixin, since its expression in these tissues coincided with the highest pigment contents detected (Table 1).Due to the fact that during the RT-PCR assay the BoCCD1 transcripts were observed in the stalk of plantlets, the tissue where pigment contents, specifically the apocarotenoid bixin, were highest (Table 1), an in situ RT-PCR assay was carried out on stalk transversal sections. The results obtained from the analysis derived from the PAS/Alcian blue preparations showed bixin to be accumulated specifically in the cells that make up the peridermis (Fig. 5G). Similarly, the BoCCD1 signal was clearly detected in cells corresponding to the xylem and surrounding the tubes of the phloem and in tissues where pigment accumulation was detected, as well as in the cells of the parenchyma and peridermis in the leaves (Fig. 5A, B).","A plethora of apocarotenoid compounds have been reported in the seeds of B. orellana, including methyl (9′Z)-apo-6′-lycopenoate, methyl (9Z)-6′-oxo-6,6′-diapocarotenoate, and methyl (all-E)-8′-apo-β-caroten-8′-oate, with bixin being the most abundant (Fig. 6). So far, only one study has investigated an expression response of carotene-related genes during development in B. orellana. In that study, expression responses of dxs, psy, pds, β-lcy, and ϵ-lcy genes were associated with pigment overaccumulation in two different annatto cultivars. However, in vivo apocarotenoid-related gene analysis and apocarotenoid production during plant development have not been conducted in this plant.The results obtained in the present study showed that bixin production is not restricted to seed tissues since this pigment was detected in all the tissues analysed, particularly in the cells surrounding the vascular tissues and in the epidermal cells. In mature seeds, bixin is located exclusively in the aril occupying the whole cell volume, suggesting that mature aril cells are used for pigment storage and lose their biosynthetic functions. Functional changes in the aril cells from meristem cells to storage cells (large central vacuole and peripheral nucleus) during the last steps of aril development have been previously described by. A constant increment in bixin production was observed during the development of immature seeds.On the other hand, ABA was detected in all the adult plant tissues analysed, and accumulated in greater amounts in floral buds and immature fruits in accordance with its role in development regulation and fruit maturation. Other pigments related to carotene precursors of bixin such as lycopene were undetected in all tissues analysed, suggesting a rapid turnover of this molecule during pigment biosynthesis. Finally, β-carotene was detected only in green tissues, in accordance with its role in photosynthesis.CCDs are enzymes involved in the production of apocarotenoids such as bixin. Two CCD genes have previously been isolated for B. orellana; however, only one of these (BoLCD) has been proved to be responsible for bixin production and its role has been shown in a heterologous system. Here, a new CCD gene, BoCCD1, was isolated (EF493214) and its sequence showed high homology with other plant CCD1s. Furthermore, the highly conserved RPE65 domain, which is responsible for the catalytic activity of the CCDs, was found to be encoded in this sequence (Fig. 2). Phylogenetic analysis conducted with the sequences of the previously isolated CCD genes for B. orellana (AJ489277 and AJ549819), and for other plants, showed that BoCCD1 shares the same ancestor gene as another CCD isolated for B. orellana (the CCD gene, AJ549819). However, BoLCD (AJ489277), the gene involved in bixin biosynthesis, is located in a distant clade (CCD4 clade), suggesting a different gene ancestor.BoCCD1 has the same phylogenetic origin as the CCD1 genes isolated from Coffea canephora (CcCCD1) or Petunia hybrida (PhCCD1), these enzymes catalysing the symmetrical 9,10 (9',10') cleavage of multiple linear and cyclized carotenoids. This cleavage results in the formation of a diverse variety of C13 cyclohexone apocarotenoids and a C14 dialdehyde, corresponding to the central portion of the original carotenoid. In addition, CCD1 cleavage activity on 5,6 (5',6') double bonds in vitro has also been reported.In accordance with the above, molecular studies were performed to analyse the role of this new CCD1 isolated from B. orellana in carotenoid production. In this sense, the primary expression profiles were obtained for different B. orellana tissues which have been analysed and characterized in previous studies. BoCCD1 mRNA was present in all of the plantlet tissues analysed (leaves, stalk, and roots), being up-regulated again in the leaves of the plantlets analysed. It was possible to relate BoCCD1 expression to total carotenoid accumulation. Expression analyses carried out on the CCD1 genes of several plant species have shown that individual genes have a tissue-specific expression profile, which is controlled in accordance with the production of apocarotenoids such as those involved in development or stress response. Here, BoCCD1 expression was high in immature seeds, although the peak in total carotenoids and bixin was observed in mature seeds. These results could mean that BoCCD1 expression is induced when pigment production begins and is down-regulated when its biosynthesis is accomplished. Consequently, a study was designed to observe the role of the BoCCD1 gene during the accumulation of total carotenoids in seeds. Immature seeds corresponding to six different developmental stages were selected to analyse the expression profile of BoCCD1 by RT-PCR. Interestingly, BoCCD1 mRNA showed a coordinated increase in its expression with the accumulation of carotenoids, particularly bixin, observed in the different developmental stages of the seeds. Similarly, the expression of CCD1s in several plant species is controlled in accordance with the production of important apocarotenoids such as β-ionone, a fragrance volatile in petunia flowers, or C13-norisoprenoids, considered flavour compounds in grape berries.The results obtained from the histological analysis revealed that the pigment granules (mainly bixin) accumulated in the surface of the seeds, settling in a layer of oily cells which cover the aril. In addition, the in situ RT-PCR assay showed that the BoCCD1 transcripts were also located in this oily layer, suggesting a relationship between this gene and the accumulation of apocarotenoids. A new in situ RT-PCR assay was carried out specifically on the aril layer of the seed. The strong signal of the BoCCD1 gene obtained in this seed tissue indicated that BoCCD1 mRNA location is concordant with the production of total carotenoids and specific apocarotenoids such as bixin. The importance of this gene in carotenoid turnover during seed maturation has been demonstrated in Arabidopsis by the construction of a CCD1 mutant, which shows a normal appearance but higher levels of mature seed carotenoids.In the in situ RT-PCR assay carried out on the stalk, BoCCD1 expression was located in the cells surrounding the xylem and phloem tissues. Results derived from the histological analysis showed that in the stalk, pigments (mainly bixin) are accumulated specifically in the cells that make up the peridermis. Both results suggest that pigment apocarotenoids are probably synthesized in the vascular tissues and later exported to the epidermal cells; accordingly, the translocation of bixin from the stalk and leaves into seeds could also be possible. Some important apocarotenoids, such as the plant hormone ABA, act in tissues different from where they were synthesized. Thus, the expression of the BoCCD1 gene is probably related to the high apocarotenoid diversity registered in different tissues of this plant and may be related to the accumulation of some specific apocarotenoids present in seeds not analysed here [i.e. methyl (all-E)-8′-apo-β-caroten-8′-oate].The cleavage sites of CCD1 suggest its possible involvement in the synthesis of several apocarotenoids of B. orellana (Fig. 6). It has been discovered that in rice, maize, and tomato plants, CCD1s also act on the C5–C6/C5′–C6′ double bonds of acyclic carotenoids, resulting in the volatile C8 ketone 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. By means of in vivo and in vitro assays, they have shown that rice CCD1 converts lycopene into three different volatiles: 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, pseudoionone, and geranial (C10). Furthermore, comparison of the relative amounts of the C19 and C17 aldehydes accumulated in the incubations with the natural substrates lycopene and 3-OH-c-carotene indicated that the preference of OsCCD1 for the C5'–C6' and C7'–C8' double bonds depends on the nature of the substrate. In the present study, the carotenoid lycopene was absent in all tissues analysed, which strongly suggests the rapid metabolism of these molecules to produce their derivatives.Finally, based on the current knowledge of the cleavage sites and substrates of this type of enzyme, it is considered that this BoCCD1 enzyme is possible related to the cleavage of lycopene at the double bonds 5–6/5′–6′ leading to the formation of the second precursor of bixin (Fig. 6). However, biochemical analyses remain to be carried out on the protein product of this gene in order to clarify this. The above idea is in agreement with the presence of transcripts of this gene (in almost all tissues) in relation to the accumulation of bixin, mainly in seed maturation developmental stages. Although a previous CCD4 (BoLCD) has been reported during bixin formation, the other CCD members, particularly CCD1, could be involved in the synergic production of bixin and other important apocarotenoids derived from its putative CCD1 activity. As previously reported in Crocus sativus, four CCDs were isolated, two CCD1s and two CCD4s, and all of them were able to cleave β-carotene at the 9, 10 (9′, 10′) positions to yield β-ionone. It seems to be common in secondary metabolism for gene families with the same enzymatic activity to be present. The data of strongly suggest that each class of enzymes could be responsible for the metabolism of carotenoids at specific and different subcellular sites, during normal development and in response to conditions of stress. Thus in B. orellana, taking into account that BoLCD seems to be a putative CCD4 protein located in plastids, and BoCCD1 seems to be cytosolic, both could, in a coordinated or alternating manner, produce several apocarotenoids in B. orellana including bixin, as in the case of C. sativus for the production of other apocarotenoids. Although the biosynthetic pathway of bixin was revealed several years ago, the predicted 5–6/5'–6' cleavage specificity of the putative BoLCD has not yet been clarified. However, for these hypotheses, additional research needs to be conducted in planta to obtain further direct evidence that BoCCD1 is involved in bixin biosynthesis and apocarotenoid diversification in B. orellana.",
73,TA043327,10.1038/s41467-022-29493-0,Collateral sensitivity to pleuromutilins in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcusfaecium.,"The acquisition of resistance to one antibiotic sometimes leads to collateralsensitivity to a second antibiotic. Here, we show that vancomycin resistance inEnterococcus faecium is associated with a remarkable increase in susceptibilityto pleuromutilin antibiotics (such as lefamulin), which target the bacterialribosome. The trade-off between vancomycin and pleuromutilins is mediated byepistasis between the van gene cluster and msrC, encoding an ABC-F protein thatprotects bacterial ribosomes from antibiotic targeting. In mouse models ofvancomycin-resistant E. faecium colonization and septicemia, pleuromutilintreatment reduces colonization and improves survival more effectively thanstandard therapy (linezolid). Our findings suggest that pleuromutilins may beuseful for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections.","Li, Qian, Chen, Shang, Zhu, Kui, Huang, Xiaoluo, Huang, Yucheng, Shen, Zhangqi, Ding, Shuangyang, Gu, Danxia, Yang, Qiwen, Sun, Hongli, Hu, Fupin, Wang, Hui, Cai, Jiachang, Ma, Bing, Zhang, Rong, Shen, Jianzhong",2022,Nature communications,2,False,False,True,"The patterns of evolutionary cross-resistance to clinical antibiotics are a major driving force for accelerating the emergence and dissemination of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria. Potential avenues for antibiotic resistance are co-selection for resistance driven by antimicrobial‐producing organisms and harmful substances in natural environments where active compounds compete for the same targets. The possibility of such cross‐resistance to clinical antibiotics has received intensive attention previously. Antibiotic resistance often carries various fitness costs in the absence of selective pressures, and such trade-offs in turn occasionally result in rugged fitness landscapes to channel the evolutionary trajectory. However, the understanding that whether and how negative responses to antibiotic selective pressure modulate the trajectory of evolution in bacteria remains unclear. Indeed, pioneering works have recently implicated the patterns of collateral sensitivity in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogens, wherein resistance to one antibiotic simultaneously induces susceptibility to another by forming either homogeneous or heterogeneous populations (Fig. 1a). The clinical implications of collateral sensitivity therefore supply prioritized rational therapies such as the sequential or concurrent deployment of reciprocal collateral sensitivity antibiotic pairs, to combat the antibiotic resistance crisis.The increasing vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) particularly vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm), with high genomic plasticity and metabolic flexibility, seriously compromise the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. The persistence and spread of VREfm within health care settings has become one of the most challenging nosocomial pathogens, leading to at least 5400 estimated deaths and more than $500 million in excess health care costs annually in the United States (U.S.) and accounting for 37% nosocomial infections in Germany. Although vancomycin resistance is widely mediated by mega-plasmids containing diverse van gene clusters, these resistance alleles have been persistently maintained in VRE with low or without fitness cost. Therefore, a better mechanistic understanding of antibiotic resistance is urgently required to combat VREfm associated infections. However, the evolutionary and pharmacological consequences of dedicated van genes remain largely unknown. In this work, we exploit the evolutionary trade-offs to identify the collateral sensitivity patterns of 102 clinical VREfm isolates nationwide for antibiotic repurposing. Our observations indicate that pleuromutilin antibiotics are promising candidates targeting VREfm in vitro and in animal models, shedding light on the evolution-directed rational design of antibiotic therapies against MDR bacterial infections.","Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics were performed using the standard broth microdilution method, according to the CLSI 2020 guideline. Briefly, single bacterial colonies (including E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and 210 E. faeciums isolates) were cultured in Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) at 37 °C at 220 r.p.m. for 8–12 h. Subsequently, antibiotics with two-fold dilution in MHB were mixed with an equal volume of bacterial suspensions in MHB containing approximately 1.5 × 106 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL in a clear UV-sterilized 96-well microtiter plate. The plate was placed in the incubator for 16–18 h at 37 °C and then the MIC values were read. MIC values were defined as the lowest concentrations of antibiotics with no visible growth of bacteria.An overnight culture of VREfm CAU369 was diluted 1:100 in MHB and incubated at 37 °C, 200 r.p.m. for 4 h, to obtain bacteria at exponential phase. Then the bacterial suspension was challenged with lefamulin at 4 × MIC, 10 × MIC and 40 × MIC. Subsequently, 10-fold serially diluted suspensions were plated on BHI agar plates for overnight incubation at 37 °C. Finally, colonies were counted and CFUs per mL were calculated accordingly.An overnight culture of VREfm CAU369 were inoculated in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) to adjust bacterial suspensions to approximately an OD600 of 0.5, following by the addition of propidium iodide (PI) to a final concentration of 10 nM, then treated with lefamulin and linezolid at the levels of 1 × MIC, 5 × MIC and 10 × MIC for 34 min after centrifugation.

Then, 190 µL of the culture was mixed with 10 μL of PBS containing lefamulin at the level of 1 × MIC, 5 × MIC and 10 × MIC in the black, clear-bottom, 96-well plates. Benzyl alcohol (50 mM) was used as a positive control. Last, the fluorescence intensities of Laurdan were measured at the excitation wavelength of 350 nm and emission wavelengths of 435 nm and 490 nm in two-min intervals using the Infinite M200 Microplate reader (Tecan).

Meanwhile, bacterial precipitates were lysed by lysozyme, and centrifuged, then the supernatants were prepared for the measurement of intracellular ATP levels. The detecting solution was added to a 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for another 5 min. Last, the supernatants were added to the well and mixed quickly, before recording in the model of luminescence using the Infinite M200 Microplate reader (Tecan).The accumulation of intracellular antibiotics in bacteria was determined based on the established liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.

Bacteria were then centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 mins at 4 °C and the supernatants were collected for three times. Subsequently, bacterial cells were diluted to 1010 CFU per mL with fresh PBS and aliquoted in 1.5 mL tubes. The aliquots were treated with subinhibitory levels of lefamulin at 37 °C for 1 h and the samples were collected to destroy the cell envelopes for LC-MS/MS analysis (Waters 2695). Additionally, structure elucidation of accumulated lefamulin in four phenotypes of E. faeciums isolates were based on UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap analysis (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Lefamulin (1/8 × MIC, 1/4 × MIC, 1/2 × MIC and 1 × MIC) was added into 96 well microplates and mixed with an equal volume of cultures. Growth curves were established by OD600 determination with an interval of 1 h at 37 °C, by Infinite M200 Microplate reader (Tecan).Filter mating was performed using VREfm CAU369 as the donor and E. faecium BM4105 (resistant to rifampicin and fusidic acid) as the recipient, according to previous study. The mating mixtures of donor and recipient were filtered through a sterile membrane filter (pore size, 0.45 μm). The filters were incubated on BHI agar plates for 24 h at 37 °C. After mating, the conjugants were selected on BHI agar containing rifampin (100 μg/mL), fusidic acid (20 μg/mL) and vancomycin (20 μg/mL) after incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h.The msrC overexpression mutant was constructed based on a modified conjugative transformation assay, according to previous study.

The plasmid pAM401+vanRS was transferred into E. faecalis JH2-2. Filter mating was performed using E. faecalis JH2-2 (pAM401 + vanRS) as the donor and E. faecium BM4105 as the recipient. After mating, the conjugants were selected on BHI agar containing chloramphenicol (50 μg/mL) and arabinose after incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h.An overnight culture of VREfm CAU369 was diluted 1:100 in BHI and incubated at 37 °C, 200 r.p.m. for 4 h. Bacteria were obtained at exponential phase and treated with or without lefamulin and vancomycin (0.5 × MIC, 1 × MIC, 10 × MIC) for 1 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was extracted using the EASYspin Plus kit (Aidlab, cat. RN4301) and quantified by the ratio of absorbance (260 nm/280 nm) using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). The qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR premix Ex Taq qPCR Kit (TaKaRa, catalog no. RR820A). Cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. All samples were analyzed in triplicate and the gene 16 S rRNA was used as an endogenous control as described in our previous publication. The fold changes of gene expression were analyzed by 2−∆∆CT method. Genes names and primer sequences used in the qRT-PCR analysis are listed in Table S7. GraphPad Prism 8 was used to plot graphsOvernight cultures (VREfm CAU369 and VREfm CAU378) were diluted 1:100 in BHI and incubated at 37 °C, 200 r.p.m. for 4 h, to obtain bacteria at exponential phase. Then the bacterial suspensions were treated with lefamulin at the level of 1 × MIC and 10 × MIC for 15 min and 1 h. Then the bacteria were washed with fresh PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) three times and the bacterial cells were spun down by centrifuging at 8,000 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4 °C. RNA-Seq library building and RNA-seq data analysis are described as described previously.Metabolomics were determined based on UPLC-QTOF MS analysis. Overnight cultures (VREfm CAU369 and VSEfm CAU309) grown in BHI broth were harvested and washed with 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) three times. Then, approximately 50 mg precipitation of bacteria was mixed with 0.5 mL 80% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid (FA). After shaking for 30 s and ultrasonic treatment for 20 min, all samples were frozen for 1 h at −20 °C for protein precipitation. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min and the supernatant (200 μL) was obtained. (O)PLS-DA (Orthogonal signal correction partial least square discrimination analysis) was performed and VIP (variable importance in projection) was calculated by MetaboAnalyst 4.0 and R project.Overnight cultures VREfm CAU378 were diluted 1:100 in BHI and incubated at 37 °C, 200 r.p.m. for 4 h, to obtain bacteria at exponential phase. Then the bacterial suspension were treated with lefamulin at the level of 1 × MIC and 10 × MIC for 1 h. Then cells were lysed and the protein was reduced and alkylated by heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by sonication for 20 min. The resulting mixture was diluted 10 times with the dilution buffer composed of 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5) and 10% acetonitrile (ACN) and the protein was digested with trypsin at 37 °C overnight. After digestion, the total protein was acidated with 5% TFA and loaded onto a C18-column which had been pretreated and equili- brated with methanol and 0.2% acetic acid respectively. For MS analysis, total peptides were dissolved in 0.1% FA and analyzed by Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Raw data were processed with PD software package against the sequence data of VREfm.VanR purified and P-VanR prepared according to a previously described protocol. Binding reactions between P-VanR (12–1.5 μM) and msrC promoter fragment (212-bp, 0.3 ng) based on the gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Briefly, P-VanR was incubated with different concentrations. After 15 min incubation, the reaction mixture was subjected to 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresis was performed at 80 V in ice-cold bath. The images were visualized and acquired by the PharosFX imaging system (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of lefamulin, a mouse intestinal colonization model was involved according to a previous publication. Briefly, 6–8 weeks old female ICR mice (20 g, n = 6 per group) were treated with PBS, lefamulin and linezolid. First, mice were administered 0.5 g per L ampicillin in drinking water for 5 days. On day 0, mice were infected with VREfm CAU369 (1 × 109 CFUs) by gavage. After the treatments with drugs, CFUs of VREfm CAU369 were enumerated in the feces from 1 to 7 days. Meanwhile, intestinal contents (including ileum, cecum and colon) were collected on the first and seventh day for bacterial counting and the evaluation of the abundance and diversity of intestinal flora, using a previously described method. The alpha analysis and the beta diversity analysis were performed based on PCoA/NMDS analysis. GraphPad Prism 8 was used to plot graphsTo construct an immunosuppressive mice model, the 6–8 weeks old ICR female mice (20 g, n = 6 per group, 18 mice were used in total) were treated with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide intraperitoneally at the 1st day and 3rd day. After the second cyclophosphamide was treated for 24 h, mice were infected with 0.5 mL of VREfm CAU427 suspension (1 × 1010 CFU per mouse) via intraperitoneal injection. At 1 h post-infection, all mice were treated with lefamulin and linezolid with 10 mg/kg every 24 h. PBS was used as the negative control. The survival rates of treated mice were recorded during a 96 h period and the bacterial number in the mice organs was counted on the plates.Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.","To identify the trade-offs in VREfm, we first determined the susceptibility and constructed the network of collateral sensitivity of 10 main classes of antibiotics routinely used in the clinic against both 20 VREfm and 20 vancomycin sensitive E. faecium (VSEfm) isolates. Markedly, compared to VSEfm, we observed that VREfm exhibited specific susceptibility to lefamulin (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Tables 1, 2), an approved pleuromutilin antibiotic by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in 2019, although they displayed general cross-resistance to multiple antibiotics as expected (Fig. 1c). The susceptibility to lefamulin increased more than 500 folds, from ≥16 μg/mL to 0.03 μg/mL. To extend whether other ribosome-targeting antibiotics display similar behaviors, we tested eight antibiotics with different binding sites. It confirmed a strong collateral sensitivity to lefamulin with the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 50% bacteria (MIC50) of 0.03 μg/mL in VREfm, whereas most VSEfm were resistant to lefamulin with MIC50 of 16 μg/mL (Fig. 2a). Therefore, we hypothesized that such collateral response could be due to the distinct modes of action of pleuromutilins (PLEs).To test the generality of VREfm channeled evolution toward elevated susceptibility to pleuromutilins, we first performed the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of five pleuromutilins routinely used in human and veterinary medicine (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 2a). We expanded the number of E. faecium isolates to 210, including 102 VREfm isolates of human origins and 109 VSEfm isolates of human, animals and probiotics in China. These VREfm isolates validated the robust collateral sensitivity to pleuromutilins, particularly the decreased MICs of lefamulin, retapamulin and valnemulin with resistance ratios of <0.002 (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 1). Our results are consistent with previous empirical observations that the analogs of pleuromutilin tend to be efficacious against VREfm. To further verify this phenomenon, we compared the genomes of 79 global VREfm isolates (Supplementary Table 3) with 21 domestic ones, and found that the allelic profiles in China showed high genetic relationships with that in Europe and North America (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Notably, the vanA gene clusters are dominant (95%, 20/21) in 21 clinic VREfm isolates (Supplementary Fig. 1b), consisting with the vanA genotype most frequently recorded. To further assess the generality of collateral sensitivity in other van gene clusters, we found that a clinical vanB-type E. faecium isolate showed similar collateral patterns to five pleuromutilins (Supplementary Table 2). Then, we tested the activity of lefamulin against E. faecalis including vancomycin resistant/ sensitive isolates. In contrast to VREfm, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VREfs) were resistant to lefamulin (Fig. 2c), implying the species specificity of collateral sensitivity in enterococci. The collateral pattern indicates the species-specific effect, where the collateral sensitivity to pleuromutilins in VREfm is contingent upon the intrinsic genomics. It is consistent with previous studies that the van gene clusters are located on pMG1-like and pheromone sensing plasmids in VREfm and VREfs, respectively. Additionally, the ubiquity of plasmid-encoded toxin-antitoxin gene systems may also account for the species-specific effect. Collectively, it suggests that the antibiotic pairs of vancomycin and pleuromutilins exhibit ubiquitous collateral sensitivity in VREfm.To further characterize the collateral response, we noticed the susceptibility of 210 E. faeciums isolates in four patterns that approx. 90% isolates (89/102) of VREfm display collateral sensitivity to pleuromutilins using lefamulin as a model (PsVr) (Fig. 2d). Intriguingly, we observed the contrary pattern of pleuromutilin susceptibility in VSEfm, in which approx. 90% isolates (96/109) of VSEfm were resistant to pleuromutilins (PrVs). Therefore, E. faecium shape the divergent evolution upon pleuromutilins to four patterns, including PsVr, PsVs, PrVs and PrVr, and in turn such contingency can be used to design rational approaches to treating the prevalent VREfm associated infections.The unique collateral sensitive antibiotics suggest that the interaction between pleuromutilins and the target may shed light on elucidating the evolutionary conservation in VSEfm. First, lefamulin showed moderate bacteriostatic activity against VREfm at a high level (1.2 μg/mL, 40 × MIC) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Furthermore, we quantified the accumulation of lefamulin in eight E. faecium isolates including all four phenotypes of heterogeneous collateral responses and found no difference (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). Last, we confirmed there was almost no further modifications for the accumulated lefamulin in E. faecium (Supplementary Fig. 5c–j). These data denote that the intrinsic properties of pleuromutilins should be excluded and the main target of pleuromutilins should eventually dominate the trajectory of collateral response in VREfm.Pleuromutilins exhibit distinctive recognition to the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) by blocking bacterial protein biosynthesis. Pleuromutilins mainly interact with eight nucleotides in the PTC domain. We first confirmed that there were no mutations at such sites in 20 VREfm and 20 VSEfm isolates based on whole-genome sequence analysis (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Figs. 2c, 6b). Moreover, we found no genes such as cfr encoding methyltransferases to confer universal resistance (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Interestingly, we found that pleuromutilins had a higher affinity to ribosomes in PsVr than PrVs type strains through fluorescence polarization analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b), implying that VREfm may modulate the susceptibility to pleuromutilins through the mechanism of ribosomal protection. The ATP-binding cassette F (ABC-F) protein family protects bacterial ribosomes from multiple classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. We found the presence of four prevailing genes (msrC, eatA/eatAv and lsaE) of the 26 members of the ABC-F family in 40 E. faecium isolates (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Nevertheless, both lsaE and eatA/eatAv were partially carried by clinical isolates and expressed at similar levels in the presence and absence of pleuromutilins (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). Extremely, we noticed that the species-specific gene msrC expressed more than 70-fold higher in model strain VSEfm CAU310 than VREfm CAU369 (Supplementary Fig. 9c), suggesting that the low expression of msrC may potentiate the efficacy of pleuromutilins. Meanwhile, we observed that the decreased transcription of msrC in two lefamulin sensitive VREfm isolates (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 10a) is in a dose-dependent manner of lefamulin. Furthermore, we found the increased transcription of msrC in all 12 lefamulin resistant isolates as well (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Figs. 10b, 11). Constantly, we obtained the increased expression of MsrC in a lefamulin resistant VREfm CAU378 treated with lefamulin for 1 h (Fig. 3c), based on proteomics analysis. Additionally, the MsrC overexpression strain was constructed in a pleuromutilins-sensitive strain using conjugative transformation (Supplementary Fig. 12a). We found that the conjugant (pAM401 + msrC) shows high expression of msrC and are resistant to all pleuromutilins (Supplementary Fig. 12b–d). Taken together, these results indicate that msrC is linked with the collateral sensitivity in VREfm.To explore how MsrC reduces the susceptibility to pleuromutilins, we performed a simulation analysis on the interaction between MsrC and the PTC domain. Compared to the affinity between pleuromutilins and PTC with Z-docker interaction energy of −146.324 kcal, the residues of R241 and L242, and K233 and K246 in MsrC competitively bound to the shared binding sites U2504 and C2063 of MsrC and lefamulin in PTC domain, respectively, with Z-docker interaction energy of −170.611 kcal (Fig. 3d). These findings indicate that high expression of species-specific MsrC tends to block pleuromutilins targeting PTC in VSEfm, whereas the low expression of MsrC facilitate the binding of pleuromutilins in VREfm accordingly.To understand how msrC mediates collateral response in VREfm, we first observed the delayed growth curves of a constructed conjugant containing the vanA-plasmid from E. faecium CAU369 (pCAU369) in E. faecium BM4105-RF, in the presence of sub-inhibitory levels of lefamulin (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). It suggested that the plasmid carrying the van gene cluster plays a crucial role in the increased susceptibility to pleuromutilins in VREfm. Subsequently, we showed that most van gene clusters are dominant vanA-type (95%, 19/20) (Supplementary Fig. 6b), consisting with previous reports that the increasing dissemination of vanA-VREfm is prevalent world widely, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Therefore, we compared 14 plasmids containing vanA gene clusters in global E. faecium isolates (Supplementary Table 5) with that in E. faecium CAU369, and noticed only the vanA gene clusters were present in all isolates (Supplementary Fig. 13). Thus, we deduced that the vanA gene clusters (~ 6–7 kbp), instead of the other motifs in the vanA-type megaplasmids (~ 30–150 kbp), contribute to the collateral sensitivity to pleuromutilins in VREfm.Given that the decreased expression of msrC in VREfm (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 9c), we hypothesized a negative feedback between msrC and the vanA gene clusters. To verify such epistasis, we found the sequence in the promoter of msrC shared high similarity (83.3%, 10/12) to the promoters of vanR/H/Y (Fig. 4a) and the promoters are conserved in both vanA- and vanB-type isolates globally (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicating that phosphorylated VanR may simultaneously induce van transcription but inhibit msrC transcription. Toward this goal, we exploited transcriptome analysis on VREfm treated with lefamulin. Remarkably, we observed vanRS activation and decreased msrC transcription in pleuromutilin-sensitive VREfm CAU369, whereas there was no vanS activation and 33.1% vanR transcription, and increased msrC transcription in pleuromutilin-resistant VREfm CAU378 (Supplementary Fig. 16). Consistently, we confirmed the opposite patterns of vanS and msrC transcription in pleuromutilin-resistant isolates under lefamulin treatments based on qRT-PCR and proteomics analysis (Fig. 4b–d, Supplementary Fig. 17a, b). To validate that vanR modulates msrC expression, we constructed a conjugant by receiving a recombinant vanRS plasmid in a pleuromutilin resistant E. faecium (Supplementary Fig. 18). The transcription of vanR and vanS were activated in a dose-dependent manner under lefamulin treatments (Supplementary Fig. 19a, b), in turn, the transcription of msrC in the conjugant (pAM401 + vanRS) was dramatically inhibited (Supplementary Fig. 19c). Correspondingly, the conjugant with vanRS expression is sensitive to pleuromutilins, with more than 16-fold decreased MICs (Supplementary Fig. 19d). These results support our hypothesis that the negative epistasis between the van gene cluster and msrC is responsible for the collateral sensitivity to pleuromutilins in VREfm.To further verify that P-VanR regulates msrC transcription, we first demonstrated that P-VanR binds to the msrC promoter using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 4e, f). Furthermore, we calculated the EC50 (effective concentration for 50% response) as 1.01 μmol/L for P-VanR binding to the fragment of msrC promoter, which is much lower than the binding affinity between P-VanR and the vanH promoter (Fig. 4g). When in the presence of inducers such as classic vancomycin and lefamulin, VanS switches its activity from phosphatase to kinase, phosphorylating the cognate response regulator VanR. Phospho-VanR then binds to similar promoter sequences triggering the transcription of the van gene cluster, and inhibits msrC transcription to induce VREfm sensitive to pleuromutilins accordingly (Fig. 4h). Altogether, these results indicate that P-VanR co-regulates vanR/vanH and msrC by binding to similar promoter fragments, to facilitate pleuromutilins against VREfm.In addition, antibiotic resistance/tolerance can be regulated by metabolic reprogramming, which, in principle, could boost the effectiveness of antibiotics, consistent with the observation that anaerobic glycolysis further exacerbated the growth of VREfm with vanA-plasmid in the presence of subinhibitory levels of lefamulin (Supplementary Fig. 14c). To test this possibility, we dissect whether metabolites modulate collateral response in VREfm. Since there is no Krebs cycle in enterococci, the dominant pyruvate metabolism kept steadily (Supplementary Fig. 21a–c). Considering the abundance of metabolic versatility and the challenge to genetically manipulate clinical isolates, its contribution to collateral sensitivity in most VREfm with mega-plasmids remains unclear.Given that VRE usually resists multiple classes of antibiotics, we hypothesized that pleuromutilins might be used to treat VRE associated infections based on our observation. Lefamulin was recently approved in the U.S. and European Union for the treatment of CABP in adults. To further assess the efficacy of lefamulin, we empirically evaluated its efficacy in two mouse models including an intestinal colonization model (VREfm CAU369) and in a peritonitis-septicemia model in mice (VREfm CAU427) (Fig. 5a). First, we found that VREfm CAU369 mainly colonized in the cecum and colon with remarkably decreased bacterial burden after a single dose of lefamulin (Fig. 5b). Remarkably, lefamulin showed better antibacterial efficacy than linezolid, the only antibiotic with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treating VRE infections, especially in the cecum and colon on the first day after administrations. Meanwhile, we collected daily the feces for bacterial counting. Compared to clinically recommended linezolid, lefamulin similarly produced time-dependent reduction in bacterial burden of feces over the 7-day treatment period (Fig. 5c). In addition, VREfm promptly dominated mouse gut microbiota after intragastric inoculum based on bacterial community analysis, whereas lefamulin administration notably reduced its abundance through the upregulated the genera of Akkermansia and Klebsiella (Fig. 5d). After 7 days, all mice nearly eliminated the pathogens and appeared healthy. Intriguingly, lefamulin could restore the homeostasis of fecal microbiota faster than the untreated group according to the Chao1 and Shannon indexes (Supplementary Fig. 22a, b), particularly the patterns of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Clostridium, and Escherichia/Shigella on the 7th day (Supplementary Fig. 22c–f). In the peritonitis-septicemia model, the survival curve showed that all mice survived under the treatment of a dose of 10 mg/kg lefamulin after 96 h (Fig. 5e), with reduced bacterial counts in organs (Fig. 5f). Altogether, our results suggest that lefamulin efficiently remedies the severity of VREfm infections, which may be extended to treat and diminish bacterial colonization since that there are limited effective agents available to treat such infections in clinic.For the foreseeable future, VRE especially VREfm will remain an important nosocomial problem, particularly the steady increase in the U.S. since the early 1990s in hospitals. Because VREfm has developed resistance to essentially every antibiotic used in clinic, novel therapeutic strategies to explore collateral sensitivity may be attempted. A better understanding of the evolutionary biology particularly epistasis by which the van genes manipulate ribosome protection could shed light on intervention strategies against VREfm pathogens. Notably, plasmid mediated epistasis is not restricted to E. faecium, and we postulate that such collateral response may be widespread phenomenon in other bacteria. Mobile plasmids drive the spread of many critical antibiotic resistance genes in clinical pathogens. Most recently, it has been demonstrated the collateral sensitivity associated with transferable plasmids in clinical E. coli isolates, compared to previous empirical observations and mutations in chromosome and plasmids. Our results suggest that the evolutionally collateral response has already dominated the prevalent VREfm carrying conjugative plasmids (Supplementary Fig. 14a). To argue for preclinical development of pleuromutilins as leads against VREfm, continued studies should further focus on the evaluation whether pleuromutilins reduce VREfm colonization in patients and maintain microbiota recovery after its expansion.In conclusion, our results demonstrate the epistasis between van genes and msrC mediating collateral sensitivity in most clinically relevant VREfm strains, to potentiate the efficacy of pleuromutilins. These observations in vitro and in vivo provide proof-of-concept for an efficient therapeutic option against the increasingly aggravating VREfm associated infections by revitalizing existing antibiotics. Pleuromutilins not only exhibit robust bacteriostatic activity against clinical isolates nationwide but also attenuate the colonization possibly improving clinical outcomes. Overall, our work expands the knowledge of evolutionary compensatory phenomenon for the implementation of existing antibiotics to combat MDR bacterial pathogens.",,

EC is well known by its high rate of metastasis, aggressive invasion and poor prognosis. Surgery and chemotherapy are effective treatments for EC diagnosed at an early stage, while a lot of EC patients comes to recurrence or metastasis, and eventually develop to advanced stages of cancers, which present poor prognosis. Therefore, it is of great urgent to explore the new and efficient treatment strategies, so as to improve the poor survival status of EC patients.Ginsenoside CK is the main metabolic component of ginseng in human body. Previous studies confirmed that Ginsenoside CK has anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, liver protection, improving immune function and other effects. Furthermore, the therapeutics values of Ginsenoside CK in tumors have well been studied in bladder cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer which can significantly suppress the proliferation ability of these tumor cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), a highly specific pro-vascular endothelial cell growth factor, which can promote extracellular matrix degeneration, vascular permeability, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of vascular endothelial cells. Study suggested that Ginsenoside CK inhibit tumor angiogenesis by suppressing the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, inhibiting the activity of VEGF-A and it’s signaling pathway, and the degradation of vascular extracellular matrix in neuroblastoma cells. However, there are few studies focus on the effects of Ginsenoside CK on esophageal cancer cells and its molecular mechanism. As a targeted drug with high efficiency and low toxicity, Ginsenoside CK has great development potential in esophageal cancer.In our present study, we aim to further explore the effects of Ginsenoside CK on the cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and related mechanisms on Eca109 cell.","Human esophageal cancer cell (Eca109) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, USA). Eca109 cell maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) containing with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin streptomycin (Gbico, USA) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.The changes of cell proliferation were evaluated by employing the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cells (2.5 × 103) per well were cultured in 96-well plate overnight. To investigate the proliferation effect of Ginsenoside CK (MedChemExpress, USA) on Eca109 cell, cells were maintained with different concentrations of Ginsenoside CK for 72 h. Similarly, lentivirus transfection cells were maintained in 96-well plate for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h or 96 h, then added with 10 μl CCK-8 reagent (New Cell & Molecular Biotech, China) to each well, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The absorbance value (OD450) was detected by using the microplate reader (Bio-Tek, USA).Eca109 cells were transfected with knockdown lentivirus sh-VEGF-A, and the corresponding negative control lentivirus sh-NC which were purchased from Hanbio (Shanghai, China). Puromycin was used to screen the stably transfected cells. Western blot analysis was applied to evaluated the efficiency of lentivirus transfection.Eca109 cell (5 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates for 24 h and scraped by a sterile pipette tip. Cells were cultured with DMSO or Ginsenoside CK in FBS-free medium. sh-NC and sh-VEGF-A cells were maintained with FBS-free medium. The Zen Imaging software (Carl Zeiss, Germany) was applied to observe images at 0 h, 24 h and 48 h. The Image J software (USA) was applied to calculate the scratch area.The migration and invasion assays were detected by transwell chamber (BD, USA) with the presence of Matrigel (BD, USA) for invasion, and absence of Matrigel for migration. Cells (5 × 104) per well pretreat with Ginsenoside CK or lentivirus were planted into the upper chamber with 100 μl serum-free medium, and the lower chamber with 600 μl complete medium. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the lower chamber cells were fixed with 70% methanol and then stained by crystal violent (Beyotime, China). The migrated or invaded cells were counted.Ec109 cells (1.5 × 105) were maintained in 6-well plates overnight and treated with Ginsenoside CK or DMSO for 48 h. sh-NC and sh-VEGF-A cells (1.5 × 105) were planted in 6-well plates for 48 h. The rates of apoptosis cells were assessed by applying the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Beyotime). The results were detected by the CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman).Membrane and Cytosol Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime, China) and Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime) were used for protein extracted and quantified. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel (Beyotime) and then blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). The PVDF membranes were incubated in 5% skim milk for 2 h. After that, all membranes were cultured with the primary antibodies of anti-Tubulin (1:10,000, Affinity, USA), anti-VEGF-A (1:1000, Affinity), anti-Pi3k (1:1000, Affinity), anti-P-Pi3k (1:1000, Affinity), anti-Akt (1:1000, Affinity) and anti-P-Akt (1:1000, Affinity) overnight at 4 °C.

The western blot analysis confirmed that Eca109 cell were stably transfected with lentivirus (Fig. 3B). The CCK-8 assay showed that cell proliferation was remarkably reduced after sh-VEGF-A transfection (Fig. 3C). Wound healing and transwell assays further confirmed that VEGF-A gene knockdown suppress the proliferation, migration and invasion of Eca109 cell (Fig. 4A, B).To investigate the function of Ginsenoside CK intervention and VEGF-A gene knockdown in cell apoptosis, Annexin V-FITC and PI staining was applied. The flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis showed that Ginsenoside CK intervention and VEGF-A gene knockdown promoted the apoptosis rate of Eca109 cell (Fig. 5).It is confirmed that the VEGF-A/ Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Pi3k)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway play important roles for the tumor progression on proliferation, migration, and invasion behaviors. The present study detected the decrease expression of VEGF-A, P-Pi3k, and P-Akt proteins after Ginsenoside CK intervention, while the total proteins of Pi3k and Akt were unchanged. The knockdown of VEGF-A inhibits the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and induce apoptosis in Eca109 cell. Moreover, the knockdown of VEGF-A gene lead to the decrease expression of P-Pi3k, and P-Akt proteins (Fig. 6), which suggested that the VEGF-A/Pi3k/Akt pathway may present as downstream of Ginsenoside CK treatment in Eca109 cell.","Esophageal cancer is a highly malignant digestive tract tumor, ranking the 5th among the causes of cancer-related death in worldwide. Although the diagnostic techniques and treatment methods for esophageal cancer have been continuously improved recent decade, the overall survival status of esophageal cancer patients is still unsatisfactory due to the characteristics of early invasion and distant metastasis. Ginseng, as a treasure of human pharmaceutical culture, contains a variety of active components, among which ginsenoside is the main bioactive compound in ginseng and has broad implications in human disease. Ginsenoside CK is a natural diol-type ginsenoside with medicinal activity in vivo. Studies found that Ginsenoside CK has inhibiting effects on various tumor cells, containing lung cancer, colon cancer, and liver cancer, as well as bone tumor. The anti-tumor effects of Ginsenoside CK are mainly reflected in its ability to reduce the proliferation, migration, and invasion in tumor cells. Chen et al. found that Ginsenoside CK can induce cell apoptosis and inhibit the biological activities of human osteosarcoma cells via blocking the Pi3k signaling pathway. Oh et al. revealed that Ginsenoside CK promote cell autophagic and apoptosis which can inhibit human neuroblastoma cells viability both in vitro and vivo. In the present study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of Ginsenoside CK and its related mechanism in Eca109 cell, which found that Ginsenoside CK can suppress Eca109 cell proliferation, migration, invasion, induce apoptosis and down-regulated the expression of VEGF-A, P-Pi3k, and P-Akt proteins after Ginsenoside CK intervention.VEGF-A playing as an important regulator of angiogenesis and presenting as the mediator of endothelial cells proliferation. Down-regulating the expression of VEGF-A can suppress tumor progression in gastric cancer. Zhang et al. reported that the blockage of VEGF-A can inhibits the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. Pi3k/Akt signaling pathway can be activated by angiogenesis inducers and growth factors, like angiopoietins and VEGF-A. Some studies found that Pi3k/Akt presented as the main downstream signaling pathway mediating the biological effects of VEGF-A, and the VEGF-A/Pi3k/Akt signaling pathway playing significant roles in proliferation, migration and invasion of various cellular processes. Study confirmed that VEGF-A/Pi3k/Akt signaling pathway present an important role in the proliferation, migration and invasion of renal carcinoma cells. In our study, we observed that Ginsenoside CK intervention decrease the expression of VEGF-A, P-Pi3k, and P-Akt proteins. Therefore, we speculated that the VEGF-A/Pi3k/Akt signaling pathway may present as the downstream in Eca109 cell after Ginsenoside CK intervention. Furthermore, the VEGF-A gene knockdown investigation showed VEGF-A down-regulation inhibit the cell proliferation, migration, invasion, induce apoptosis and decrease expression of P-Pi3k, and P-Akt proteins in Eca109 cell which further supported the hypothesis that Ginsenoside CK suppress the progression of Eca109 cell via affecting VEGF-A/Pi3k/Akt signaling pathway.","In conclusion, our present study found that Ginsenoside CK can suppress the cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and induce apoptosis of Eca109 cell via VEGF-A/Pi3k/Akt signaling pathway, which suggests that Ginsenoside CK may serve as an effective treatment in EC."

Cultivated in Bulgaria and Their Antimicrobial and AntioxidantActivity.,"The genus Nepeta, belonging to the family Lamiaceae, includes about 300 species,most of which are used in folk medicine due to their pronounced biologicalproperties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the agrobiologicalcharacteristics of Nepeta transcaucasica (N. transcaucasica) Grossh. and Nepetacataria (N. cataria) L., cultivated in Bulgaria, and obtain their essential oilsand determine their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. The agrobiologicalcharacteristics of the two species growing in Kazanlak were analyzed; therefore,high variability in the population of N. transcaucasica and comparativehomogeneity in N. cataria was shown. The species N. transcaucasica contained0.28% essential oil with main components β-citronellol (52.05%), eucalyptol(7.34%), β-citronellal (6.06%), germacrene D (5.45%), (Z)-β-ocimene (5.14%), andβ-caryophyllene (3.06%). The species N. cataria consisted of 0.19% essential oilwith main components β-citronellol (26.31%), geraniol (15.92%), neral (11.45%),nerol (9.56%), carvacrol (6.04%), and β-citronellal (5.35%). The antibacterialactivity against Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcusaureus and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonellaenterica subsp. enterica serovar Abony was determined. The essential oils showedantimicrobial activity only against E. coli. The diameters of the inhibitionzones were found to be 26 mm for the species N. transcaucasica and 10 mm for thespecies N. cataria. The antioxidant activity of the two essential oils was alsodetermined by four different methods, DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC, with thehighest values for the ABTS radical, for the species N. transcaucasica (48.72 μMTE/mL), and the species N. cataria (310 μM TE/mL).","Mollova, Silviya, Dzhurmanski, Anatoli, Fidan, Hafize, Bojilov, Dimitar, Manolov, Stanimir, Dincheva, Ivayla, Stankov, Stanko, Stoyanova, Albena, Ercisli, Sezai, Assouguem, Amine, Marc, Romina Alina, Ullah, Riaz, Bari, Ahmed",2023,ACS omega,2,False,False,True,"The genus Nepeta is one of the largest of the Lamiaceae family, with about 300 species distributed in temperate regions, mainly in central and southern Europe, the Middle East, central and south Asia, and some parts of Africa and North America.

The plants of the genus are known for their medicinal properties, which is why they are mainly used in folk medicine to treat various diseases.−The species N. transcaucasica Grossh. and N. cataria L. are most widely used for decorative and culinary purposes, as well as in folk medicine.−The chemical composition of the essential oil of the species N. cataria has been the subject of several studies by authors from different countries. The oxygenated monoterpenes such as citronellal, neral, geranial, citronellol, nerol, and geraniol, some small amounts of other oxygenated monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes such as β-caryophyllene and α-humulene have been identified as the main components in its composition− as and other volatile aromatic compounds. The comparative analysis of these studies shows that the amount of the main components varies depending on the origin of the plant, the soil and climatic conditions, the individual stages of its development, and the methods of drying the raw material before distillation. The essential oil has proven antimicrobial− and antioxidant activity.− It also exhibits other biological properties, which is why it finds a variety of applications.The N. transcaucasica essential oil has been the subject of less research. It was established that its main components were monoterpene hydrocarbons such as α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, and γ-terpinene and their oxygenated derivatives such as citral, citronellol, and 1,8-cineole as well as nepetalactones. The essential oil has proven antimicrobial activity.In Bulgaria, species of the Nepeta genus are found mainly in the wild and are used in folk medicine.−For several years, two species of N. transcaucasica and N. cataria, which are currently not industrial raw materials for obtaining essential oil, have been grown in the experimental field of the Institute of Roses, Essential and Medical Plants, the city of Kazanlak, Bulgaria.In this experimental field, systematic studies are carried out to establish the influence of soil and climatic conditions on the development of plants of both species, stem height, flower size, and flowering time, to select the most suitable samples for essential oil extraction.The aim of the present study was to determine the chemical composition and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of essential oils from the species N. transcaucasica and N. cataria, grown under the conditions of the Kazanlak field, with possibilities for their application in food and cosmetic preparations.","Populations of biennial plants of N. transcaucasica Grossh. and N. cataria L. were studied. Fresh stalks of the species N. transcaucasica and N. cataria, grown in the experimental field of Institute of Roses, Essential and Medical Plants, city of Kazanlak, Central Bulgaria (42.61°94′408″N 25.39°29′576″E, altitude of 407 m) were used. The experiments were conducted in 2019.The soils in the area were leached cinnamon forest, developed on old diluvial deposits, structureless with good aeration and water permeability, with an acidic pH of 4.9, and poorly stocked with nitrogen 20.5 mg/1000 g, phosphorus 4.25 mg/100 g, potassium 21.75 mg/100 g, and a humus content of 1.8%.Plants were grown under nonirrigated conditions, with planting patterns 0.7 m between rows and 0.3 m within the row.The raw material was collected during the mass flowering phase, with a moisture content between 60 and 65%, determined by drying at 105 °C to a constant mass. It was processed by steam distillation in a laboratory copper distillation apparatus with a capacity of 5 L and a process duration of 2 h. The distillation type for obtaining essential oil at technological parameters was close to the production conditions in which the essential oils were mainly processed by steam distillation. The oil obtained was dried over anhydrous sulfate and stored in tightly closed dark vials at 4 °C until analysis.Prior to the GC–MS analysis, 100.0 μL of the essential oils was vacuum-dried in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator (CentriVap, Labconco, Kansas City, Missouri) at 40 °C. The dried residue was dissolved in a 100 μL solution of methoxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg/mL in pyridine) and heated at 70 °C for 1 h at constant shaking (300 min–1) (Thermo Shaker TS-100, Analytik Jena AG, Germany). After cooling, 100 μL of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA, silylation agent) was added, and the mixture was heated again while stirring (70 °C, 40 min, 300 min–1). The injected sample volume was 1.0 μL.GC–MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 7890A chromatograph interfaced with a 5975C mass-selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, USA). Separations were done on an HP-5ms column, 30 m × 0.25 mm (i.d.) coated with a 0.25 μm film of poly(dimethylsiloxane) as the stationary phase. The instrumental parameters were as follows: the carrier gas was helium, maintained at a constant rate of 1.0 mL/min; an injector and transfer line temperature of 250 °C; an MS source temperature of 230 °C; the oven temperature program started from 100 °C (held for 2 min); then, the temperature was increased to 180 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min (held at 180 °C for 2 min) and then to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min (held at 300 °C for 10 min); a total run time of 42 min; a split mode of 20:1; MS scans from 50 to 550 m/z. The components in the sample were identified based on their retention indices and by comparing their mass spectra with those in the NIST 08 spectra library. The retention (Kovats) indices were calculated using a standard calibration mixture of n-alkanes (C8–C40) in n-hexane. The amounts of the identified compounds were expressed as a percentage of the total ion current (TIC), after normalization of the recorded peak areas.The antimicrobial activity of essential oils and distillates was tested against pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria. The test cultures were derived from the National Bank for Industrial Microorganisms and Cell Cultures in Sofia, Bulgaria. Gram-positive bacteria used in our study were Listeria monocytogenes NCTC 11994 and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) ATCC 25093, and Gram-negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (E. coli) ATCC 8739 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Abony NCTC 6017.The medium was inoculated with a 24 h suspension of the bacterial species at a density of approximately 107 cfu/mL (turbidity: 0.5 McFarland standards). The antimicrobial activity was determined by a modification of the “agar diffusion” method by measuring the zones of inhibition of the growth of pathogens and fungi (mm) around sterile rings (Ø 6 mm) in which 0.05, 0.07, and 0.10 mL of essential oil were placed.Chromatographic-grade methanol and ethanol were used for HPLC analyses (VWR, Austria). Ammonium acetate, copper(II) chloride, glacial acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, ferric chloride hexahydrate, quercetin, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethychroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox), and reagents 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), neocuproine (2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline), and 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine (TPTZ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) was determined by using the colorimetric method reported by Re et al. with slight modifications.The antioxidant activity was measured according to the procedure of Brand-Williams et al.The cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) method described by Apak et al. was performed.The ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) method described by Benzie and Strain was performed.The analyses were made in triplicate. The data were expressed as the mean ± SD. Data were expressed as mean ± SD. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Statistical program SPSS 19.0 software was used for data analysis by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test to evaluate differences between mean values of activities (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).","Agrobiological studies show that the soil–climatic conditions are favorable for the development of Nepeta transcaucasica and Nepeta cataria and form a significant and quality raw material.The population of N. transcaucasica is highly heterogeneous according to the studied agrobiological parameters. Precocious plants numbered 7 and 9 stand out, which enter the mass flowering phase at the beginning of the third 10 days of April but form an insignificant above-ground mass and yield a fresh herb of only 70 g per plant. In the case of the late forms, entering the phase of mass flowering in the middle of June, the highest productive indicators are observed, reaching a fresh herb yield of 1540 g from one plant. The established significant differences in the organoleptic evaluation of fresh herbs are a prerequisite for selecting suitable forms with increased odor characteristics of the plant. The data are presented in Table 1.The population of N. cataria is relatively uniform, with a typical citral odor of the drug without the off-flavor characteristic of specimens from the wild flora. The agrobiological characteristics of Nepeta cataria are presented in Table 2. A highly variable indicator is the number of stems of different thicknesses, forming a different structure in producing the fresh drug. The presence of plants with a more significant number of thinner stems determines the presence of more leaf mass. Therefore, it predetermines a higher essential oil content in the drug because the primary essential oil containers are found in the leaves. In this connection, differences are also observed in the drying rate, determined by the different thicknesses of the stems and their lignification.Essential oils are easily mobile light yellow liquids with a specific smell, which does not contradict the data from the literature.The chemical compositions of the oils are presented in Table 3. As seen, 51 components representing 99.72% of the total content were identified in the oil from N. transcaucasica. Thirteen of them were in concentrations over 1%, and the rest of the 38 constituents were in concentrations under 1%. The major constituents (about 3%) of the oil are as follows: β-citronellol (52.05%), eucalyptol (7.34%), β-citronellal (6.06%), germacrene D (5.45%), (E)-β-ocimene (5.14%), and β-caryophyllene (3.06%).Forty-one compounds were identified in the composition of N. cataria, representing 99.72% of the total content identified in the oil. Ten of them were in a concentration over 1%, and the rest of the 30 constituents were in concentrations under 1%. The major constituents (about 3%) of the oil are as follows: β-citronellol (26.31%), geraniol (15.92%), neral (11.45%), nerol (9.56%), carvacrol (6.04%), and β-citronellal (5.35%).The diameters of the zones of inhibition compared to the tested test cultures are presented in Table 4. The data show that the oils are only active against the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli, with the other test cultures being resistant.The antioxidant activity results are presented in Table 5.","The presence of plants with a more significant number of thinner branches determines the presence of more leaf mass that has not fallen; this, in turn, determines the content of essential oil in the drug because the leaves contain the primary containers of essential oil. In this regard, the drying rate depends on the thickness of the stems, which is determined by the different degrees of lignification.The Nepeta plants can be harvested twice. The first mowing could be in the budding phase, the beginning of flowering when the plant has a significant leaf mass that has yet to fall from the high temperatures in July. The second mowing could be done in the fall, at the beginning of October, when the plants massively stop flowering, and a significant amount of essential oil accumulates in the inflorescences.The soil–climatic conditions in the Kazanlak field are favorable for developing both species since they form a significant above-ground mass. The population of the species N. transcaucasica is highly heterogeneous according to the studied agrobiological parameters and allows the selection of suitable forms. The N. cataria population is relatively uniform with a typical citral smell of the plant without side, unpleasant notes, characteristic of specimens collected from natural habitats in Bulgaria.These values approach the data described in the literature for the species N. cataria by Aćimović et al. (0.24%) and Tiwari et al. (0.1–03%). Still, they differ from the data of Baranauskienė et al. (5.94%). For the species N. transcaucasica, yield data also differ from those published in the literature by Mishurova and Shikhiev (0.94%) and Pelyakh et al. (0.8–1.4%). The soil and climatic conditions can explain the established differences in the amount of essential oil in both species during the vegetation of the plants.The chemical composition of the two investigated oils is similar, with the identified components differing only in quantity. The N. transcaucasica essential oil has a higher content of oxygenated monoterpenes eucalyptol and β-citronellol, of the monoterpene hydrocarbon β-ocimene, of the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon germacrene D, and nepetalactones. A higher amount of monoterpene alcohols nerol and geraniol, aldehydes neral and geranial, and phenol carvacrol was found in the oil of the N. cataria species. These differences can be explained by species characteristics, which were also found by other authors when studying the chemical composition of essential oils from different species of the genus Nepeta.The distribution of the compounds by groups (% of the composition) is presented in Table 3. The data show that oxygenated monoterpenes dominated (78.38 and 84.93%) the composition of the studied oils followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (0.02 and 3.53%).The comparative analysis of the chemical composition of N. transcaucasica essential oil shows that the amounts of the main components differ from the data in the literature. According to Baranauskienė et al., the main compounds were oxygenated monoterpenes such as citronellol (17.69%), geranial (9.05%), and geranyl acetate (8.20%). Mishurova and Shikhiev determined that the main compounds were monoterpene hydrocarbons such as α-pinene (2.2%), β-pinene (11.8%), myrcene (0.5%), limonene (7.4%), and γ-terpinene (7.81%); by Pelyakh et al., the main compounds were oxygenated monoterpenes such as citral (8.1–24.6%) and citronellol (21.6–54.8%). Kilic reported that the main compound was oxygenated monoterpene 1,8-cineole (14.4%). In the essential oil studied by us, the amounts of nepetalactones were deficient, in contrast to the data of Baranauskienė et al. (14.34%), Kilic (18.5%), Karakuş et al. (93.75%), and İşcan et al. (over 65%).In the case of N. cataria essential oil, differences were also found with the data from the literature regarding the amounts of oxygenated monoterpenes such as β-citronellol, geraniol, neral, nerol, carvacrol, and β-citronellal. In the essential oil studied by us, the quantities of nepetalactones were deficient, in contrast to the data of Baranauskienė et al. (over 80%), Tiwari et al. (67.9–87.5%), and Azizian et al. (81.3%). These differences can be explained mainly by how essential oils are obtained. In the steam distillation used in this study, only the primary oil is separated in the receiver of the apparatus, and the resulting distillates are discarded. In laboratory glassware, where the raw material is processed by water distillation, primary and secondary oils are separated in the receiver. The raw material boils with the distillation water, which can change the oil’s chemical composition. The influence of various technological factors, such as temperature, pressure, and duration, on the chemical composition, including the content of nepetalactone, was investigated in the preparation of extracts with CO2 and essential oil of the species Nepeta persica Boiss.Twenty-four known aromatic substances can cause allergic reactions, as described in the EU Directive (1223/2009). It has been established that using various cosmetic preparations (emulsion creams, gels, lotions, shampoos, masks, etc.) containing some of the allergens listed in the Directive may cause various skin changes, the so-called allergic contact dermatitis on the face, hands, and scalp. Symptoms of allergic reactions are swelling, redness, rashes, severe itching, eczema, or increased skin sensitivity, expressed by a feeling of pain. These symptoms can appear hours or days after using the given cosmetic product, which is why specialists often experience difficulties accurately identifying the allergen. Allergic reactions can also include headache, sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, etc.−Six of the allergens specified in the EU Directive were found in the tested oils, and their quantity is as follows:In the N. transcaucasica species are β-citronellol (52.05%), neral (2.42%), geranial (1.51%), geraniol (1.44%), limonene (0.35%), and β-linalool (0.07%).In the N. cataria species are β-citronellol (26.31%), geraniol (15.92%), geranial (11.58%), neral (11.45%), limonene (0.16%), and β-linalool (0.15%).The data show that the total amount of allergens is higher in N. cataria essential oil, which should be avoided or properly labeled when required by regulations about leave-on and rinse-off cosmetic products.Despite the high content of oxygenated monoterpenes, which have proven biological properties, the oils have weak antibacterial activity.The essential oil of N. cataria species is known to have a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of three species of Bacillus bacteria—Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. It was found to have a low antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, and E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. This action is explained by the presence of nepetalactone in the oil. It shows good antibacterial activity, especially on Salmonella typhi, against the yeast Candida albicans and other micro-organisms.−The essential oil of the species N. transcaucasica has proven activity against Candida yeasts, and extracts of the plant with polar solvents have antibacterial activity.Copper and iron are essential trace elements in many enzymes and physiological processes. However, in the free form, they have a toxic effect because Cu(II) catalyzes the oxidation of ascorbic acid, and reactive oxygen systems (ROS) such as superoxide radicals (O2•–) and H2O2 are generated. In this catalytic process, Cu(II) and Fe(II) react with H2O2, and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) are generated via the Fenton reaction.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a result of cellular metabolism. Under physiological conditions, enzyme systems regulate ROS levels. They are known to damage vital molecules of biological importance such as phospholipids, proteins, and DNA. It has been shown that damage caused by them is associated with the development of a number of diseases (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease). Even in a state of physiological health, the toxic effects of oxygen and its derivatives accumulating in the body lead to a reduction in life expectancy.In the present work, we investigated the antioxidant activity of the essential oil of two species of Nepeta. We used different methods to evaluate the ability to deactivate free radicals and the ability to reduce copper (Cu2+) and iron (Fe3+) ions.Depending on the mechanism of the antioxidant reaction, the methods were divided into hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and single electron transfer (SET) techniques. The HAT method is based on the antioxidant’s ability to quench free radicals via a hydrogen donor. SET methods are characterized by the reductive ability of one electron transfer of the tested antioxidant to a radical species. FRAP and CUPRAC are single-electron transfer methods. ABTS and DPPH methods are considered as methods using both hydrogen and single-electron transfer.There are data in the literature on the antioxidant activity of Nepeta species extracts with different polar solvents, making it difficult to compare.The antioxidant action of the oils is explained by the high content of oxygenated monoterpenes, which have a proven biological effect. According to Tepe et al., the high antioxidant activity of N. cataria essential oil is due to the oxygenated monoterpene derivatives 1,8-cineole and linalool. In the studied oils, the first component is in greater quantity in the species N. transcaucasica (7.34%), while the species N. cataria is minimal (0.08%). The linalool content in both oils is in low concentrations, 0.07 and 0.15%, respectively. In a study by Azizian et al., it is stated that the species N. cataria has a high content of polyphenolic acids such as ferulic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and coumaric, as well as flavonoids, which determines antioxidant capacity by DPPH (77.26%) and FRAP ( 2.23 μmol Fe++ g–1).It is possible that the higher antioxidant activities of N. cataria compared to N. transcaucasica is due to the higher contents of N. cataria in the sum of oxygenated terpenoids (Table 3), such as oxygenated compounds, for example, verbenol, isopulegol, 3-(Z)-nonen-1-ol, α-terpineol, myrtenol, β-citronelol, nerol, geraniol, and carvacrol.","Comparative agrobiocharacteristics of two cultural species of the genus Nepeta, N. transcaucasica and N. cataria, cultivated in Bulgaria, were carried out. The soil and climatic conditions in the Kazanlak field are favorable for developing both species and determining the formation of significant and high-quality plant material. They differ in yield, chemical composition, and biological activity of essential oils. The species with higher antibacterial activity was N. transcaucasica essential oil, which can be included in food products. The N. cataria essential oil had more pronounced antioxidant activity. Still, it had a higher content of allergens in essential oil, which is an indicator that should be avoided in cosmetic products. The application of essential oils in food and cosmetic products could be a subject of our future research."

Fungicidal resistance of some commercially used fungicides ascendedthe need for a naturally effective alternative. The current study aimed toevaluate the fungicidal activity of Vitex agnus-castus extracts in vitro againstsome Candida species. METHODS: The bioactive compounds contained in the crude andalcoholic extracts were compared, and the antioxidant activity was tested, aswell. The phytochemical analysis was carried out by Fourier Transform-InfraredSpectroscopy (FTIR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Thescavenger activity of the tested extracts was tested, as well. The anticandidalactivity was tested to detect the effect of the tested extracts on the mycelialgrowth of Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Candiatropicalis, Candida famata, Candida rhodotorula, and Candida dublinesis. Theminimum inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all reported activities.The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the Transmission Electron Microscopy(TEM) were used to detect the morphological and ultrastructure response in someselected species. RESULTS: FTIR and GC/MS revealed the existence of differentbioactive chemical groups such as polyphenols, fatty acids, terpenes, terpenoids,steroids, aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, phytol which is a diterpene. DPPHresults confirmed the antioxidant activity of all extracts where the methanolicextract was the strongest scavenging substrate. All extracts showed stronginhibitory effects against different species at a concentration of 200 µg/ml(P < 0.001). SEM and TEM showed morphological and ultrastructure changes in C.famata. CONCLUSION: The current study suggested a reliable antifungal activity ofdifferent extracts of Vitex agnus-castus against different Candida species andstrains. However, further studies are required to confirm the safety of theseextracts to be used in medical applications.","Al-Otibi, Fatima O, Alrumaizan, Ghaida I, Alharbi, Raedah I",2022,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2,True,True,True,"For almost 5,000 years, plants were used for food, beverage preparation, and medicinal purposes. Medicinal plants possess therapeutic properties or exert beneficial pharmacological effects on the human body. In the Arab world, in the Middle East (excluding Iran and Turkey) and North Africa (MENA) region, medicinal plants are interesting healthcare resources and salient elements of prophetic and folk medicine. Scientific studies have proven that some plants, such as garlic, pomegranate, black seeds, Costus, Miswak, Henna, ginger, and Fenugreek are effective for treating human diseases. Medicinal plants enrich the sources of components that can be used in drug/ therapeutic development.Medicinal plants naturally synthesize and accumulate other secondary metabolites, like alkaloids, sterols, terpenes, flavonoids, etc.. Secondary plant metabolites are numerous chemical compounds produced by the plant cell through metabolic pathways derived from the primary metabolic pathways. These metabolites are referred to as active substances, which have beneficial physiological effects on living organisms. They possess various biological effects, which provide the scientific base of herbs in traditional medicine in many ancient communities. They have been described as antibiotics, anti-fungal, and antiviral agents, and, therefore, they can protect against different pathogens.Candidiasis is a common infection caused by Candida sp., widespread in the environment. A characteristic phenomenon of some Candida Species is their ability to commensal with other native species of bacteria to induce harmful colonization in different organs of the human body such as the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina. In one of the most frequent fungal infections, urinary tract infections (UTI), C. albicans is considered the most common source of infection, with C glabrata and C tropicalis . Despite the immune response initiated to control and resist the harmful candida infection, it was reported that the excessive usage of antibiotics, which might induce morphological and genetic changes in the native bacteria increase the acidity and chemical composition of the surrounding environment and permit the candida infection. The resistance to the common anti-candida treatments is a well-known issue that was reported by different medical agencies and clinical studies. As been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 7% of all Candida infections, particularly by C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. auris, and C. glabrata were resistant to fluconazole . That suggested searching for other possible anti-candida treatments such as natural plant extracts.Vitex is a member of the family Verbenaceae and includes about 250 species distributed, worldwide. V. agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree or sage tree, is a little deciduous tree or large shrub with a showy summertime flower display. V. agnus-castus fruit is commonly traditionally employed for a range of female reproductive disorders, including premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and female hormonal imbalances such as the depression, cramps, mood swings, water retention, and weight gain associated with PMS, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), lactation difficulties, low fertility, and menopause-related complaints. Several phytochemical studies showed that different parts of V. agnus-castus (fruits, leaves, and flowering stems) contain numerous secondary metabolites, such as iridoids, flavonoids, terpenoids, essential oils, ketosteroids, and vanillic acid. These bioactive components are naturally occurring in most plant materials, which are known to possess interesting biological properties such as antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Despite that, V. agnus-castus is poorly studied for its clinical uses.The current study aimed to test the anticandidal effect of different extracts of V. agnus-castus leaf against different Candida species assess their possible inhibitory effects.","A new fresh, disease-free, Vitex agnus-castus plant was purchased from a local herbal market in Al Haier region, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Plants were identified, authenticated, and classified by Dr. Najat Bukhari, a taxonomist from the Department of Botany and Microbiology, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.For the preparation of different extracts of Vitex agnus-castus, leaves were washed several times with tap water, distilled water, and dried at room temperature. An amount of 45 g of dried leaves was crushed and grounded in 450 ml of either 96% Ethanol, absolute Methanol, or sterile distilled water to prepare the ethanolic, methanolic, or aqueous extracts, respectively. The extracts were placed in a shaker at 145 rpm for 48 h and then filtered using gauze. The filtrates were evaporated by aeration at room temperature. The dried crude extracts were rediscovered in the corresponding solvent (ethanol, methanol, or dis, water) to prepare different concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200 µg/ml). Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to enhance dissolving the extract.Eleven Candida strains were used to assess the antifungal activity of Vitex agnus-castus. The species were four strains purchased from (ATCC, Manassas, VA, United States) included C. albicans (ATCC® 60,193™), C. krusei (ATCC® 14,243™) (Ck1), C. parapsilosis (ATCC® 22,019™) (Cp1), C. tropicalis (ATCC® 66,029™). Other seven strains were obtained from either King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), or King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and included C. parapsilosis (Cp2), Candida famata, C. rhodotorula, C. dublinesis, C. auris, C. krusei (Ck2), and C. krusei (Ck3). The fresh inoculum was prepared by subculturing the studied species onto a Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) medium at 28 °C for 48 h, as previously described. The turbidity of growing Candida suspension was adjusted to match the turbidity standard of 0.5 McFarland units, by spectrophotometry tune of 0.1 OD and was read at 600 nm wavelength.Plant samples were analyzed as been described before.The dried powder of the aqueous extract of V. agnus-castus was used for FTIR analysis. Briefly, 10 mg of the dried extract powder was encapsulated in 100 mg of KBr pellet to prepare translucent sample discs. The powdered sample of each plant specimen was loaded in FTIR spectroscope FT-IR (Nicolet 6700 FT-IR Spectrometer, Waltham, MA, USA).The methanolic and ethanolic extracts were quantified by a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, 7890A GC System). It was equipped with a column Agilent DB-WAX (30 m × 320 μm × 0.25 μm), coupled to a mass spectrometer Agilent Technologies (5975C V2-MSD with Triple-Axis Detector), with Autosampler and injector (G4513A) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States). The machine was programmed at temperature 60 °C for 5 min, then at 11 °C/min increments up to 250 °C. The injector flow rate was 250 °C; carrier gas was He of 99.9995% purity, column flow rate 1.2926 mL/min.A working solution of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) reagent at a concentration of 100 µM, was prepared as follows; by adding 4 mg of DPPH to 10 ml methanol and mixing well (Stock solution (SS) of 1 mM) and kept in dark. The methanol was diluted (1:10) and kept in darkness. A serial dilution of Ascorbic Acid (as a positive control) or tested reagents was prepared, by dilution in water and mix well (SS). The working solution (WS) (100 µg/ml) was prepared by diluting in water (1:100). In 96 well plates add the reagents (of ascorbic acid or tested reagents). Triplicates of each reagent were prepared and incubated in dark for 30 min. The absorbance was read at 517 nm. The percentage inhibition of DPPH free radical scavenging activity was calculated as follows:where:Ac = Absorbance of DPPH (concentration 0 µg/ml).At = Absorbance of sample (extract/ascorbic acid).The anticandidal activity of different extracts was evaluated by the “Well Diffusion Method”. Briefly, 10 mL of SDA medium was poured into the sterile Petri dishes as a basal layer, followed by the addition of 15 mL seeded medium, previously inoculated with the prepared microbial suspension at the concentration of 1 mL of fungal suspension/100 mL medium, to attain a viable cell count of 105 CFU/ml. The plates were further incubated at 35 °C for 48 h, where the inhibition zone diameter was measured using a Vernier caliper as an indication of antifungal activity. Terbinafine was used as a positive control at a concentration of 50 μg/disk. Interpretation criteria of terbinafine as the antifungal agent corresponding to the inhibition zone diameter was ≥ 20 mm.MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of plant extract exhibiting antifungal activity. MIC was evaluated for all extracts of V. agnus-castus, as previously described. MIC was calculated according to the following equation:Morphological and ultrastructure characterizations of selected fungal growth as a response of plant extracts detected by Scanning electron microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy.Primary fixation by buffered Glutaraldehyde (2.5%) overnight performed in a refrigerator, then washed by phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and later fixed by buffered Osmium Tetroxide 1%. Then, samples were dehydrated by a series of ethanol concentrations. It then freezes dried in a critical point dryer and mounted on gold plated stubs. Samples were observed through scanning under a JEOL scanning electron microscope. The treated samples were coated with gold in a vacuum evaporator and examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM Quanta-250, FEI, Czech Republic).Primary fixation by buffered Glutaraldehyde (2.5%) overnight performed in a refrigerator, then washed by phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) followed by secondary fixation using buffered Osmium Tetroxide 1% overnight in a 4 °C. The sample was then dehydrated by a series of ethanol concentrations and embedded by a resin mixture of SPI-Pon™- Araldite® Epoxy Embedding Kit (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, United States). That was followed by cutting using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome produced section thicknesses between 70–80 nm and then loaded on a copper grid. The samples were then stained by aqua's uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined under Jeol JSM-1011 electron microscope (Akishima, Tokyo, Japan).Means and standard deviations were calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 (Armonk, NY, United States).All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.not applicablenot applicable.","The widespread of pathogenic bacterial and fungal microbes is considered one of the problems, that threaten human existence. Several studies reported the continuous multidrug resistance, particularly, among Candida spp., which increased the efforts towards suitable substitutions. One of these efforts is the use of pump inhibitors associating drugs, such as Quinoxaline derivatives, which inhibit the activity of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and further affected the mycelial growth of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei . Another study showed that natural and synthetic treatment contained an adequate amount of quinolines, sulfur-containing heterocycles indoles, phenols, and pyridines can act as NorA efflux pump inhibitors, which can reduce the growth of Staphylococcus aureus . In the current study, the phytochemical analysis of different extracts of V. agnus-castus showed the existence of variable phenolic compounds, which might act as efflux pump inhibitors and reduce antimicrobial resistance.The aqueous extract of V. agnus-castus was analyzed by FTIR to investigate the functional groups (Fig. 1). The results revealed the presence of OH-stretching associated with alcohols, phenols, or polyphenols. Furthermore, the peaks revealed the existence of several functional groups Hydroxyl, aromatic compounds, amine salts, and unsaturated ketones (Table 1). In agreement with our results, a previous study showed that the FTIR analysis of V. agnus-castus proved the presence of Alkenes, alkyl halides, Aromatic compounds, phenols, and hydroxyl functional groups. Another study used FTIR in the analysis of Amellia sinensis, Viola odorata, Commiphora mukul, V. agnus-castus, which revealed the presence of (C = C) stretching for a peak at 1629 and 1631 cm-1, -COOH in the range 4000–1000 cm-1, C-O and OH-stretching (carboxylic acid groups) at 1384 and 3434 cm-1, CH2-stretching at 2850 and 2922 cm-1.The results of GC/MS revealed that V. agnus-castus leaves extracts are rich in phytochemical components. A total of 34 chemical compounds were analyzed depending on the solvent type (Figs. 2 and 3). Ten compounds were investigated in the ethanolic extract (Table 2), twenty-two by methanolic extract (Table 3), and two compounds were shared in both solvents. These phytochemical compounds belong to different bioactive chemical groups such as polyphenols, fatty acids, terpenes, terpenoids, which have anticandidal activity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agents. A previous study showed that plant extracts, in which Terbenoids were reported in their chemical composition, were suggested to have significant anticandidal activity. Furthermore, steroids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and phytol compounds were reported to have significant antiviral and antimicrobial activities. In agreement with our results, a previous study showed that the extracts of V. agnus castus fruits and stems had more than 25 phenolic compounds with higher antioxidant activity such as luteolin, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, chlorogenic acid, hesperidin. In contrast to our findings, a previous study conducted the GC/MS analysis of V. agnus castus leaf extracts and revealed the existence of different chemical compositions included, 4,5-Dichloro-1,3-dioxolan-2-one, 1H-Indene, 2,3-dihydro-1,1,2,3,3-pentamethyl, and Isobutyl 4-hydroxybenzoate. All these compounds are derivatives and constituents of different bioactive materials from middle eastern plants such as terpenes, fatty acids, steroids, polyphenols, which are known for their antimicrobial activity.Antioxidants are extensively important substances that retain the capability to cover the body from damage caused by free revolutionary- convinced oxidative stress. In the current study, the antioxidant activity for all V. agnus castus extracts was tested in the hunt for new bioactive composites from natural coffers (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). V. agnus castus aqueous, ethanol, and methanol extracts present the loftiest antioxidant exertion compared with reference antioxidant ascorbic acid, for DPPH scavenging exertion, attained results for DPPH agree with the phenol contents determined for each sample. The polyphenols content in different plant extracts acts as reducing agents and antioxidants by the hydrogen-giving property of their hydroxyl groups. Hence, we could conclude that these polyphenols are responsible for the observed antioxidant exertion in this study.Different concentrations of V. agnus-castus extracts were tested to evaluate their antifungal activity against different Candida sp. (Fig. 7). As shown in Table 4, the most effective concentration in all extracts was 200 µg/ml against all species, however, the 100 µg/ml of the aqueous extract showed inhibitory effects against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis different strains. Furthermore, the growth of C. famata, C. parapsilosis (cp1), and C. parapsilosis (cp2) were significantly affected by both 100 and 200 µg/ml concentrations of ethanolic extract (P = 0.003, 0.01, 0.04) and methanolic extract (P = 0.0009, 0.02, 0.004), respectively, as compared to the anticandidal positive control (Terbinafine). The aqueous extract induced significant growth inhibition of both C. krusei (ck1) (P = 0.03) and C. krusei (ck2) (P = 0.03) with the high dose of 200 µg/ml. Also, As shown in Fig. 8, aqueous extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect on Candida growth against all species except for C. auris, C. famata, and C. rhodotorula. The growth of C. famata was strongly affected by treatment with methanolic extract, where the ethanolic extract showed the largest zone of inhibition against C. auris, C. dublinesis, and C. rhodotorula. Compared to the inhibitory effects of the Terbinafine, the aqueous extract concentration of 200 µg/ml showed higher activity against C. albicans. Also, the ethanolic extract showed higher activity against C. auris, while both methanolic and ethanolic extracts showed inhibitory effects against C. famata. All extracts had the highest inhibitory effects against C. krusei species (Table 4, Fig. 8). MIC for V. agnus-castus extracts was calculated as 150 µg/ml for most species, except for C. famata in which the MIC was calculated at 75 µg/ml (Table 4). The aqueous extract was more potent for inhibiting Candida growth than both ethanolic and methanolic extracts.In contrast to our findings, a previous study showed that the ethanolic and methanolic extracts of V. agnus-castus L. leaves induced higher antifungal effects than the aqueous extract against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MIC ranging from 1.56–25 µg/ml. Another study showed that the concentration of 200 µg/ml of V. agnus-castus leaf different extracts had significant anticandidal activity against C. tropicalis, C. albicans, and C. ciferrii, however, the measured zones of inhibition were smaller than our results.Multiple studies used different components extracted from natural plants to reduce the drug resistance observed against different pathogenic microbes. A previous study showed that the content of the essential oil extracted from V. agnus-castus L. seeds showed strong antimicrobial activity against C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. lusitaniae, C. famata, and C. tropicalis with a MIC of 130–213 µg/ml. In the same manner, another study revealed that essential oil of Ruta graveolens affected the growth of C. tropicalis and C. albicans at MIC of 4.1 and 8.2 µg/mL, respectively, and that reduced the azole resistant. On the cellular level, the cytocidal effects of essential oils extracted from Austroeupatorium inulaefolium revealed strong antimicrobial activity against resistant strains of Candida and bacteria at low concentrations. Reportedly, other plant extracts possess antioxidant and antimicrobial properties due to the presence of phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, hydroxybenzoic acids, and hydroxyphenyl propene. Hence, V. agnus-castus might be used as a possible source of natural antifungal drugs.To investigate the morphological and ultrastructure changes of the tested species, induced by V. agnus-castus, SEM analysis was performed against C. famata whose growth was the highest inhibited against the untreated control sample (Fig. 9). The control sample exhibited clear and well-demarcated cells that appeared with smooth walls and a defined bud morphology. The sample treated with methanolic extract showed misshapen, distorted, and damaged cell structures, revealed a swelling and rough appearance of the cell, and multiple blisters and bubbles formed on their surface (Fig. 9b). The microphotograph of C. famata showed distorted cells were flattened and had lost their normal morphology after treatment with the methanolic extract. The poor inhibitory activity of extracts against some Candida species, including C. albicans might be due to their inability to penetrate the cell membrane; some species of Candida synthesize biofilms. The complex extracellular matrix of biofilm is mostly impermeable and may limit the penetration of antifungal drugs by binding to the antifungal agent and blocking target sites. However, a previous study showed that the rich content of geraniol and linalool in some plants had a significant reduction in the number of viable biofilm cells of C. tropicalis and complete inhibition after 48 h of exposure. Also, it was reported that V. agnus-castus leaves had high content of caffeic by 0.277%, where the Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester was found to inhibit the growth of different candida strains by affecting the biofilm-forming and maturation abilities, which caused their death. All these studies robust the anticandidal activity of V. agnus-castus against different drug-resistant strains.The morphological changes seen in TEM were harmonious with SEM compliances. The microphotographs of cells, that didn't admit treatment, showed clear discrimination of cell membranes and walls, complete perimeters, and well-distributed cell organelles (Fig. 10a). Still, the treated cells (200 µg/ mL of methanolic excerpt) showed dramatic structural changes in organelles, accompanied by cell wall rupture in the utmost of the observed fields, dissolution or absence of cell membranes, contracted protoplasm, blebs, bulged cell membranes, distorted, and oohing cells. Some underdeveloped cells were also observed (Fig. 10b). The antifungal exertion of methanol extracts in this study might be due to a rich excerpt with numerous phytoconstituents. Methanol is an excellent detergent that excerpts numerous polar and many nonpolar composites; phenols, glycosides, coumarins, sesquiterpenes, and alkaloids may have antifungal exertion and are anticipated to be uprooted by methanol.",,"Limited data is available about the medicinal uses of V. agnus-castus. More studies should be conducted to find alternative solutions, such as natural products, to control pathogens. The current study suggested that V. agnus-castus leaves extract might be used as an alternative anti-fungal treatment against Candida infections. Many phenolic and bioactive compounds were revealed, which might explain the observed anti-candida activities. More robust, randomized, controlled clinical trials would be desirable with well-characterized V. agnus-castus preparations to corroborate its beneficial effects in vivo."

Wild-type SlNPPS catalyses regular coupling of isopentenyldiphosphate (IPP) and DMAPP in cis-orientation resulting in the formation ofneryl diphosphate. However, if the enzyme is fed with DMAPP only, it is able tocatalyse the coupling of two DMAPP units and synthesizes two irregularmonoterpene diphosphates; their structures were elucidated by the NMR analysis oftheir dephosphorylation products. One of the alcohols is lavandulol. The secondcompound is the trans-isomer of planococcol, the first example of an irregularcyclobutane monoterpene with this stereochemical configuration. The irregularactivity of SlNPPS constitutes 0.4 % of its regular activity and is revealed onlyif the enzyme is supplied with DMAPP in the absence of IPP. The exchange ofasparagine 88 for histidine considerably enhanced the non-head-to-tail coupling.While still only observed in the absence of IPP, irregular activity of the mutantreaches 13.1 % of its regular activity. The obtained results prove that regularIDS are promising starting points for protein engineering aiming at thedevelopment of irregular activities and leading to novel monoterpene structures.","Gerasymenko, Iryna, Sheludko, Yuriy V, Navarro Fuertes, Ismael, Schmidts, Volker, Steinel, Lara, Haumann, Elisabeth, Warzecha, Heribert",2022,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,2,True,True,True,,nannan,"To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.",,
78,TA043565,10.3390/nu14050962,Astaxanthin Attenuates the Changes in the Expression of MicroRNAs Involved in theActivation of Hepatic Stellate Cells.,"We previously demonstrated that astaxanthin (ASTX), a xanthophyll carotenoid, hasan antifibrogenic effect in hepatic stellate cells (HSC), primarily responsiblefor the accumulation of extracellular matrix protein during the development ofliver fibrosis. Studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in HSCactivation. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of 84 miRNAs using miRNA arraysin primary mouse quiescent HSC (qHSC) and activated HSC (aHSC) treatedwith/without ASTX during their activation. Compared with qHSC, the expression of14 miRNAs and 23 miRNAs was increased and decreased by more than 2-fold,respectively, in aHSC. Among the 14 miRNAs increased in aHSC, the expression ofmiR-192-5p, miR-382-5p, and miR-874-3p was reduced by ASTX. In addition, ASTXincreased the expression of miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-101a-3p among 23miRNAs decreased in aHSC. Moreover, we confirmed miR-382-5p expression was~15-fold higher in aHSC than qHSC, and ASTX markedly inhibited the inductionmeasured by quantitative real-time PCR. We identified that the expression ofBaz1a and Zfp462 from the predicted miR-382-5p target genes was significantlyreduced in aHSC while increased by ASTX treatment similar to the levels in qHSC.The roles of Baz1a and Zfp462 in HSC activation and the antifibrogenic effect ofASTX need to be further investigated.","Bae, Minkyung, Kim, Mi-Bo, Lee, Ji-Young",2022,Nutrients,2,True,False,True,"Liver fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including collagen. The abnormal accumulation of ECM proteins in the liver distorts the liver architecture and further impairs hepatic function. Liver fibrosis occurs in most chronic liver diseases by repeated or long-lasting liver injury. In developed countries, common causes of liver fibrosis include chronic hepatitis C infection, alcohol abuse, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) play an essential role in developing liver fibrosis. In the normal liver, HSC are present in the space between endothelial cells and hepatocytes, called Space of Disse, in a quiescent state. Quiescent HSC (qHSC) store vitamin A in the intracellular lipid droplets. When an injury occurs in the liver, qHSC are activated and transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like cells, i.e., activated HSC (aHSC). aHSC produce ECM proteins and inhibit their degradation by producing tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, leading to ECM accumulation in the liver.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of endogenous short noncoding RNAs of ~21–25 nucleotides in length, which can regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally in a sequence-specific manner. miRNAs are transcribed from miRNA genes into primary miRNAs and processed into precursor miRNAs, and finally mature miRNAs. The estimated numbers of total mature miRNAs in humans and mice are 2300 and 1317, respectively. About 1% of mammalian genes encode miRNAs, and their targets are estimated to be more than 60% of mRNAs in mammals. Studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are associated with human diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, viral diseases, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Moreover, it has been studied that miRNAs can promote HSC activation or inhibit HSC activation.Astaxanthin (ASTX) is a xanthophyll carotenoid with antioxidant properties. Studies have shown that ASTX exerts antifibrogenic actions in HSC in vitro and in the liver in vivo. We previously demonstrated that ASTX inhibits HSC activation by reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, decreasing the expression of histone deacetylase 9, and regulating the cells’ energy metabolism. However, the role of miRNAs in the antifibrogenic effect of ASTX in HSC has been poorly investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to identify new miRNAs and their target genes that may be crucial to the antifibrogenic action of ASTX in primary mouse HSC.","The pronase and collagenase digestion method was used to isolate primary mouse HSC from C57BL/6J mice, as previously described. Primary mouse HSC were plated on uncoated plastic dishes (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for spontaneous activation and maintained in low-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) as previously described. The cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cell culture supplies were purchased from HyClone (Thermo Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). The cells at day 1 and day 7 after isolation represent qHSC and aHSC, respectively.ASTX was a gift kindly provided by Fuji Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Toyama, Japan). ASTX stock and ASTX-containing media were prepared as previously described. Primary mouse HSC were treated with ASTX from day 2 to day 7 with daily media change.Total RNA, including miRNA, was isolated from primary mouse HSC using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Mature miRNA was selectively converted into complementary DNA (cDNA) using miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen). Mature miRNA expression profiling was measured using a pathway-focused miScript miRNA PCR Array for mouse fibrosis (Qiagen). The miRNA PCR Array layout is shown in Supplemental Figure S1. The expression of miRNAs was confirmed by qRT-PCR using miScript Primer Assays (Qiagen) in a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). All procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocols.RNA sequencing in primary mouse qHSC and aHSC treated with or without ASTX was conducted as previously described. The miRDB, an online database for miRNA target prediction and functional annotations, was used for predicting the miR-382-5p target genes. Among 308 target genes of mmu-miR-382-5p predicted by miRDB, 12 potential target genes were identified based on the RNA sequencing data.Total RNA isolated from primary mouse qHSC and aHSC treated with or without ASTX was converted into cDNA and used for measuring the expression of target genes using the SYBR green method in a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) as previously described.One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction was conducted using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All values were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean.","Primary mouse qHSC and aHSC treated with or without ASTX during the activation were subjected to miRNA array analysis, which can detect 84 miRNAs known to be related to fibrosis (Supplemental Figure S1). We compared the expression of miRNAs between qHSC and aHSC, and between aHSC and aHSC treated with ASTX (Figure 1A). Overall, about half of the changes in miRNA expression profiles during HSC activation were attenuated by ASTX (Figure 1B).Among 84 miRNAs investigated, miRNAs demonstrating at least 2-fold increases or decreases during HSC activation or by ASTX treatment were selected (Figure 2A,B). There were 14 miRNAs with a more than 2-fold increase and 23 miRNAs with a more than 2-fold decrease in aHSC compared with qHSC. ASTX treatment during HSC activation upregulated 4 miRNAs and downregulated 10 miRNAs. The miRNAs whose expression was altered during HSC activation and by ASTX treatment are listed in Table 1 and Table 2.To investigate whether ASTX attenuated the changes in the expression of miRNAs that were altered during HSC activation, we compared the miRNAs that showed at least 2-fold differences during HSC activation and those changed by ASTX. The expression of miR-192-5p, miR-382-5p, and miR-874-3p upregulated in aHSC was decreased by ASTX (Figure 3A). Additionally, ASTX increased the expression of miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-101a-3p downregulated in aHSC.Among those six miRNAs, miR-192-5p, miR-382-5p, and miR-101a-3p were selected for further investigation due to their high expression and higher magnitude of changes between groups. First, we confirmed their expression by qRT-PCR. The expression of miR-192-5p showed a different trend between groups from miRNA array data (Figure 3B). The expression of miR-101a-3p had a similar trend as the miRNA array result, but the magnitude of changes between groups was less than that from the array. However, the expression of miR-382-5p showed the same trend as the miRNA array with a high magnitude of changes between groups. Therefore, miR-382-5p was selected to be further investigated.As miRNAs repress their target translation by inducing mRNA cleavage, mRNA degradation, or translational repression, the target gene expression might be reduced by miRNAs. A total of 308 potential target genes of miR-382-5p were predicted by miRDB. Among the 308 target genes, 12 genes were selected whose expression was decreased during HSC activation and increased by ASTX by more than 1.5-fold based on the RNA sequencing data (Figure 4A). Potential miR-382-5p target genes include Xirp2, Hdc, Akr1c6, Fam169a, Elovl2, Flrt3, Exoc6, Hif3a, Yy2, Crem, Baz1a, and Zfp462, and their functions are listed in Table 3. We selected Hif3a, Crem, Baz1a, and Zfp462 based on their known functions and expression pattern during HSC activation and ASTX treatment. We found that the expression of Hif3a was decreased in aHSC regardless of ASTX treatment, and Crem expression was not altered during HSC activation and by ASTX treatment. The expression of Baz1a and Zfp462 was significantly reduced in aHSC, which was increased by ASTX to a similar level of qHSC (Figure 4B). Further studies are needed to investigate the roles of the target genes regulated by ASTX during HSC activation.","HSC play a vital role in developing liver fibrosis as they are the primary ECM-producing cells in the liver. We previously demonstrated that ASTX attenuated the activation of HSC by decreasing the expression of fibrogenic genes. To identify miRNAs that may play a crucial role in the regulation of HSC activation and be sensitive to ASTX, we performed miRNA arrays in primary mouse qHSC and aHSC treated with or without ASTX. Through our follow-up studies using RNA-Seq analysis and qRT-PCR, we identified miR-382-5p and its putative target genes, Baz1a and Zfp462, as potential mediators of the antifibrogenic effect of ASTX. As the roles of miR-382-5p, BAZ1a, and ZFP462 in HSC activation have not been studied, they may hold keys to identifying new mediators for HSC activation and expanding our understanding of how ASTX exerts an antifibrogenic effect.Kriegel et al. demonstrated that miR-382 was upregulated by transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), a potent fibrogenic cytokine, and induced during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human kidney epithelial cells. EMT also contributes to fibrogenesis in the liver by generating myofibroblasts, although its contribution may not be substantial. In our previous study, ASTX prevented TGFβ1-induced fibrogenic gene expressions in human HSC line LX-2 cells and primary human HSC. In the present study, primary mouse aHSC had increased expression of miR-382-5p by ~15-fold compared to qHSC, which was significantly reduced by ASTX treatment. We further identified the potential target genes of miR-382-5p predicted by miRDB analyzing miRNA and target interactions. Among the 308 predicted target genes, 12 genes were selected whose expression was decreased during HSC activation but increased by ASTX using RNA sequencing data. Furthermore, we selected Hif3a, Crem, Baz1a, and Zfp462 based on their function and expression pattern during HSC activation and by ASTX treatment. Of these four genes, the expression of Baz1a and Zfp462 was significantly reduced in aHSC, which was increased by ASTX to the level of qHSC, suggesting that these two genes may play crucial roles in mediating antifibrogenic effects of ASTX.BAZ1A or ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factor 1 (ACF1) is an accessory, noncatalytic subunit of ACF that regulates spacing of nucleosomes using ATP to form evenly spaced nucleosomes along the chromatin. The function of BAZ1A in HSC has not been reported to date. A recent study has shown that knockdown of Baz1a by lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) induced senescence-associated phenotypes in various cells, such as A549 (a lung adenocarcinoma cell line), U2OS (human bone osteosarcoma epithelial cells), HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), NIH3T3 (a murine embryonic fibroblast cell line), and MEF (mouse embryo fibroblasts). The Baz1a knockdown upregulated genes in four signaling pathways, including p53, forkhead box O (FoxO), cell cycle, and TGFβ signaling pathways. In particular, Baz1a knockdown increased mRNA and protein expression of SMA- and MAD-related protein 3 (SMAD3), an important mediator of the TGFβ signaling pathway, in A549 and U2OS cells. As we previously reported that the antifibrogenic effect of ASTX was mediated by SMAD3 in HSC, BAZ1A may play a crucial role in HSC activation and mediate the antifibrogenic activity of ASTX in HSC. In addition, Zfp462 expression was significantly decreased in aHSC compared to qHSC, which was inhibited by ASTX in the present study. ZFP462 or ZNF462 belongs to the C2H2-type zinc finger family of proteins, which is involved in transcription by regulating chromatin structure. ZFP462 is known to be crucial for early embryonic development and neuronal differentiation. The role of ZFP462 in HSC activation has not been determined, and thus it is worthwhile to investigate whether ZFP462 is an important mediator of HSC activation.In the present study, we focused on miR-382-5p due to its high expression and the magnitude of changes between groups in primary mouse HSC. The other five potential target miRNAs, including miR-192-5p, miR-874-3p, miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-101a-3p, may be worthy of future investigation. Studies have demonstrated that circulating miR-192 is upregulated in patients with NAFLD, NASH, alcoholic hepatitis, and acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Circulating miR-192 was also increased in mice fed alcohol and mice with acetaminophen-induced liver injury. In addition, exosomal transport of miR-192 from hepatitis C virus-infected hepatocytes increased the protein expression of fibrogenic markers, such as procollagen type I α1 and α-smooth muscle actin in LX-2 cells. Moreover, miR-192 was induced by TGFβ in rat tubular epithelial cells and mouse mesangial cells. However, miR-192 expression is lower in primary mouse aHSC than qHSC, consistent with the present study. In addition, primary HSC isolated from mice with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis showed a decrease in miR-192 expression compared with control. The discrepancy between studies may result from different stages of HSC activation. In addition, the in vivo activation of HSC may cause a different result, as aHSC are exposed to various other factors from neighboring cells in vivo. Therefore, further studies are necessary to investigate the expression and function of miR-192 in the activation of HSC in human livers with various pathologies, mouse livers with liver fibrosis, or HSC.There are limited studies examining the functions of the other four potential miRNAs, i.e., miR-874-3p, miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-101a-3p, in HSC. Consistent with our findings in primary mouse HSC, miR-874 was upregulated in rat aHSC compared with qHSC. However, several studies have reported that miR-874 expression was reduced in the liver of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The expression of miR-101a was decreased in the CCl4-induced fibrotic mouse liver and mouse aHSC. In addition, HSC-T6 cells, a rat HSC line, transfected with miR-101 showed suppressed proliferation, migration, and TGFβ signaling. Our study showed no change in miR-101a expression during HSC activation, while it was increased by ASTX. It suggests that the antifibrogenic effect of ASTX may be partially mediated by the induction of miR-101a. miR-19a and miR-19b are known to be downregulated in primary rat aHSC and the fibrotic rat and human liver. miR-19b inhibited transdifferentiation of primary rat HSC by reducing phosphorylated SMAD3. We previously demonstrated that ASTX attenuates TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD3 in LX-2 cells. Based on our observation, the effect of ASTX on the level of miR-19a and miR-19b was minimal; thus, the role of ASTX in the regulation of SMAD3 may not be mediated by miR-19.There is limited, somewhat conflicting information on miRNA changes in HSC and the liver. It is probable that miRNA expression in HSC and the liver may differ depending on the stage of HSC activation and liver pathogenesis. Regardless, we demonstrate the potential role of miR-382-5p and its target genes in the activation of HSC and liver diseases. Therefore, future investigation is warranted to gain detailed insight into their functions in regulating HSC activation in vivo and in vitro.","In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that ASTX has antifibrogenic properties in HSC. The present study provides potential miRNAs, especially miR-382-5p, possibly involved in the antifibrogenic effect of ASTX during HSC activation. In addition, we identified target genes of miR-382-5p, including Baz1a and Zfp462, for further investigation to determine their roles in HSC activation. Therefore, this study provides a new avenue of investigation to dissect the mechanisms for HSC activation and the antifibrogenic effect of ASTX."

Essential Oil.,"Cymbopogon olivieri essential oil from aerial parts was analyzed by gaschromotography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and led to theidentification of 38 compounds. Piperitone (72.8%), 4-carene (11.8%) andβ-himachalene (7.6%) were found as the major components of the oil. Theantimicrobial activity was achieved using disc-diffusion and microbroth dilutionassays and microbicidal kinetics of oil was screened against differentmicroorganisms. The possible antioxidant activity of oil was evaluated bydiphenylpicrylhydrazyl free-radical scavenging system. The oil had excellentantimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis andStreptococcus pneumoniae. The oil exhibited inhibitory effect against Bacillussubtilis and fungi. Dvalues of oil were 12.5, 10 and 2.4 min for Escherichiacoli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, respectively. The IC50 value ofCymbopogon olivieri oil was 35 mg/ml and its antioxidant activity was lower thanthat of butylated hydroxytoluene. Cymbopogon olivieri oil possesses compoundswith antimicrobial properties that can be used as antimicrobial agents.","Mahboubi, M, Kazempour, N",2012,Indian journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2,False,False,True,"Cymbopogon genus from Gramineae family has two perennial genus in Iran (Cymbopogon olivieri and C. parkeri) that are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.

The ingredients of oil have been subjected to number of studies in Iran. It has been found that the major components of oil from Kerman Province are; piperitone (61.0%), β-caryophyllene (14.4%), from Jiroft; piperitone (45%), delta-3-carene (22.5%) and α-eudesmol (13.3%). In another study, piperitone (53.3%), α-terpinene (13.6%) and elemol (7.7%) were found to be the major constituents of oil with excellent antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli. It has been shown that the oil from aerial part of plant with piperitone (48.9%), α-terpinene (13.8%) had excellent antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus but had no effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Piperitone, α-pinene, myrcene, pulegone were the major components of Indian C. olivieri oil. There is no study on the antioxidant activity of C. olivieri oil. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of oil and related chemical composition of oil.The oil from dried aerial parts of C. olivieri Boiss was analysed using GC-FID and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The GC apparatus was Agilent technology (HP) 6890 system, capillary column of HP-5MS (60 m×0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The oven temperature programme was initiated at 40°, held for 1 min then raised up to 230° at a rate of 3°/min and held for 10 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate 1.0 ml/min. The detector and injector temperatures were 250 and 230°, respectively. GC/MS analysis was conducted on a HP 6890 GC system coupled with 5973 network mass selective detector with a capillary column the same as above, carrier gas helium with a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a split ratio equal to 1/50, injector and oven temperature programmed was identical to GC.

Briefly, using a sterile cotton swab, 0.1 ml from 108 CFU/ml microbial suspensions was spread on the Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates for nonfastidious bacteria, Todd Hewitt Agar for fastidious bacteria and Sabouraud dextrose Agar for fungi. Sterile filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) were impregnated with 5, 10, 15 and 20 μl of the oil and were placed on the inoculated plates. These plates, after remaining at 4° for 2 h, were incubated for 24 h at 37° (for bacteria) and for 48 h at 30° (for fungi). The diameters of the inhibition zones were measured in millimetres. All tests were performed in triplicate.The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum lethal concentration (MLC) values of oil were determined by microbroth dilution assay. The oil was two-fold serially diluted with 10% DMSO which contains 16-0.0125 μl/ml of oil. These dilutions were prepared in a 96-well microtitre plate. MOPS-buffered RPMI 1640 (for fungi), cation-adjusted Muller Hinton broth (nonfastidious bacteria) and Todd Hewitt broth (fastidious bacteria) were used as broth media. After shaking, 100 μl of oil was added to each well. The above microbial suspensions was diluted (1×106 CFU/ml for bacteria; 104 for fungi) and then 100 μl was added to each well and incubated at 35°. MICs were defined as the lowest concentration of compound that inhibits bacteria after 24 h and fungi after 48 h. MLC values were the first well that showed no growth on solid media.Forty microlitres of oil according to the MLC value was added to each of the 5 ml of relevant broth tubes containing the microbial suspension of 107 CFU/ml and were then incubated in an incubator-shaker. 0.1 ml samples were taken after 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 and 60 min and spread on appropriate agar plates for 24 h at 37°. The time required to decrease the microbial population in a sample by 90% on the basis of logarithmic value (the mean total number of viable bacteria or yeast from microbicidal kinetics experiments at each time interval was converted to log10 viable cells using routine mathematical formulae) of one was regarded as Dvalue .The antioxidant activity of oil was compared with well-known synthetic antioxidants, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The hydrogen atom or electron donation abilities of some pure compounds were measured from the bleaching of the purple-coloured ethanol solution of 2, 2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Five hundred microlitres of various concentrations of the essential oil in ethanol were added to 2 ml of a 6.0×10−5 M solution of DPPH in ethanol. After a 70 min incubation period at room temperature, the absorbance was read against a blank at 517 nm. Inhibition of free radical by DPPH in percent (1%) was calculated in the following way: I% =100×(Ablank−Asample)/Ablank. Where, Ablank is the absorbance of the blank solution (containing all reagents except the test compound), and Asample is the absorbance of the test compound. Essential oil concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated from the plot of inhibition percentage against essential oil concentration. Tests were carried out in triplicate.The yield of essential oil from C. olivieri aerial parts was 3.14% w/w. Thirty-eight from thirty-nine peaks accounted for over 99% of total composition of oil. Piperitone (72.8%), 4-carene (11.8%) and β-himachalene (7.6%) were found as the major components of the oil followed by limonene (0.9%), β-fenchyl alcohol (0.8%) and elemol (0.6%) (Table 1). Piperitone is a terpene ketone found in most of Mentha species well-known to possess carminative properties. C. olivieri oil from different origins has been reported to have piperitone as the main component but at different proportions and different second major component.The antimicrobial screening of oil against different microorganisms revealed that the antimicrobial activity of the oil was dependent on the type of organisms. The oil showed excellent antimicrobial activity against majority of microorganisms. B. cereus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae were sensitive. Where as, S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis, E. faecium were resistant than other microorganisms tested. The oil showed inhibitory and cidal activity depending on the microorganisms. C. albicans were more resistant than C. glabrata and the effect of the oil on different species of Aspergillus was the same (MIC, MLC values were 1, 4 μl/ml). The strongest fungicidal activity was recorded against C. glabrata. In disc diffusion method, compared to the antibiotic employed, the activity was weak but the effect of 10 μl oil against B. cereus, C. albicans, C. glabrata was effective than vancomycin and amphotericin B. For B. cereus, the antimicrobial activity of 5 μl of oil was larger than the vancomycin. Among Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli was resistant to the oil than others like S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium were resistant than other Gram-positive bacteria to the oil (Table 2).After exposure to the MLC levels of oil, Dvalues were 12.5, 10 and 2.4 min for E. coli, S. aureus and C. albicans, respectively. These values suggest variations in the vulnerability of different microorganisms to oil. The results of antimicrobial activity are in agreement with results of Sonboli et al. Our oil had excellent antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, but had low effect on E. coli, S. typhimurium, S. aureus in contrast to Chalabian et al. The differences in the results may be attributed to the amount of major components and or trace compounds and possible synergistic and antagonistic effect of compounds in the oil. However, according to a recent investigation, piperitone showed antibacterial activity against some bacteria especially B. dipesauri and A. flavus growth at relatively low concentration. Piperitone increases nitrofurantoin susceptibility and reduces the activity of nitro reductase in a dose-dependent manner in Enterobacteriaceae.The DPPH radical-scavenging activities of the essential oil and BHT are shown in fig. 1. The examined essential oil exhibited weak radical-scavenging activity, reducing the DPPH radical formation (IC50= 35 mg/ml) in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 of BHT was 0.18 mg/ml. Essential oils reduced the concentration of DPPH free radical, with an efficacy lower than that of BHT. The oil had weaker antioxidant capacity than the positive control. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the essential oil had no powerful antioxidant activity.Weaker antioxidative capacity of oil could be attributed to the composition of oil. The survey in literatures did not exhibit any research on antioxidant activity of 4-carene and piperitone. When the antioxidant activity of 3-carene was evaluated by two systems and compared with about 100 pure compounds, the result showed that 3-carene as monoterpene hydrocarbon exhibited low antioxidant activity and this effect was dose-dependent. Even if it is demonstrated that piperitone and 4-carene have high antioxidant activity; the composition of all components in C. olivieri oil showed low antioxidant activity. Further experiments are necessary to verify the relation between chemical composition and antioxidant activity.The results of this investigation exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity and a little antioxidant activity. The oil possesses compounds with antimicrobial properties that can be used as/in new drugs for treatment of infectious diseases and have potential for use as botanical preservatives.Our results support the ethnopharmacological uses of this plant in folk medicine and could provide useful data for utilisation of oil in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry.",,,,
80,TA034318,10.3389/fpls.2025.1527477,Integrative analysis of metabolite and transcriptome reveals the biosyntheticpathway and candidate genes for iridoid glycoside biosynthesis in Neopicrorhizascrophulariiflora (Pennell) D.Y.Hong.,"Neopicrorhiza scrophulariiflora (Pennell) D.Y.Hong (N. scrophulariiflora) is animportant wild medicinal plant that belongs to the Plantaginaceae family. Itsmain active ingredients, picroside I (P-I) and picroside II (P-II), possessanti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antibacterial properties. Due tooverharvesting, N. scrophulariiflora resources are facing the risk of depletion,urgently requiring resource protection and rational utilization. However, thebiosynthetic pathways and related genes of active compounds in N.scrophulariiflora have not been fully investigated. In this study, widelytargeted metabolomics and RNA-seq technology were employed to perform a jointanalysis of the metabolome and transcriptome in different tissues of N.scrophulariiflora, including the roots, stems, and leaves. A total of 196flavonoids and 63 terpenoids were identified. Among the 158,254 annotated genes,74 were annotated as related to iridoid synthesis. Using bioinformatics methodssuch as clustering analysis, phylogenetic tree construction, and weighted geneco-expression network analysis (WGCNA), 43 candidate genes were identified thatmay be involved in the biosynthesis of picroside-I and picroside-II, of which 26genes were significantly correlated with the synthesis of picrosides and theirintermediates. Transcriptome analysis revealed the expression patterns ofdifferentially expressed genes, and metabolomic analysis revealed thedistribution characteristics of metabolites in different tissues of N.scrophulariiflora. Through qRT-PCR validation, we found that three NsF3H/NsF3Dgenes, four NsUGD/NsUPD genes, one Ns2HFD gene, and three NsSQM genes mayparticipate in the iridoid biosynthesis pathway. These findings provide importantgenetic and metabolomic information for an in-depth understanding of thebiosynthetic mechanisms of iridoids and lay the foundation for the protection andsustainable utilization of N. scrophulariiflora.","Rao, Ke, Liu, Siyu, Tang, Xiaohui, Jia, Guofu, Yang, Shaohua, Ren, Chaoxiang, Pei, Jin",2025,Frontiers in plant science,2,False,False,True," Neopicrorhiza scrophulariiflora (Pennell) D.Y.Hong (N. scrophulariiflora) is a perennial medicinal plant that belongs to the genus Neopicrorhiza of the family Plantaginaceae. It is distributed across southern Tibet, northwestern Yunnan, western Sichuan in China, and Nepal. It is a congeneric plant with Neopicrorhiza kurroa Royle ex. Benth. (N. kurroa), and they are the only two species of this genus. Owing to overharvesting and the lack of organized cultivation in recent years, its habitat range has become increasingly narrow, resulting in a sharp decline in the population of N. scrophulariiflora. This species has been listed as an endangered species by the IUCN. Studies have shown that the secondary metabolites of N. scrophulariiflora possess various pharmacological effects, such as liver protection, ischemia–hypoxia protection, and anti-inflammatory, anti-asthmatic, and immunomodulatory effects. The active components of N. scrophulariiflora include iridoids, phenylethanoids, and phenolic glycosides. Among them, the iridoid glycosides picroside-I and picroside-II are monoterpene derivatives formed by the acylation of catalpol and phenolic acids. They are also unique active ingredients in this genus. According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition), the total contents of picroside-I (P-I) and picroside-II (P-II) are medicinal indicators of N. scrophulariiflora.P-I and P-II are iridoid glycosides of N. scrophulariiflora, and the synthesis of iridoid glycosides can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, geranyl diphosphate (GPP) is produced via the MVA (mevalonate) and MEP (methylerythritol phosphate) pathways. The key enzymes involved include 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXPR), acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (ACTH), mevalonate kinase (MVK), and 4-(cytidine-5′-diphospho)-2-C-methylerythritol kinase (ISPE). In these two pathways, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) undergoes a series of reactions to convert into geranyl diphosphate (GPP). The second stage involves the iridoid biosynthesis pathway. At this stage, geranyl diphosphate (GPP) undergoes the removal of two phosphate groups to produce geraniol. Subsequently, geraniol is sequentially converted through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions to form 10-hydroxygeraniol, 10-oxogeranial, and iridodial, which ultimately participate in the synthesis of iridoid glycosides.However, the downstream biosynthetic pathways of P-I and P-II have not been elucidated, and researchers speculated about the biosynthetic pathway of picrosides in N. kurroa. This pathway begins with the iridoid skeleton. The products generated from the iridodial and epi-iridodial undergo cyclization to form iridorials. The subsequent steps include the formation of an aldehyde group at the C-4 position, glucosylation at the C-1 position, and simultaneous oxidation of the aldehyde group at the C-4 position to form a carboxyl group, resulting in 7-deoxyloganic acid. This enzyme-catalyzed step is likely catalyzed by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD). Subsequently, 7-deoxyloganic acid is converted to mussaenosidic acid in a similar reaction catalyzed by flavanone 3-dioxygenase/hydroxylase (F3D). Mussaenosidic acid undergoes dehydration catalyzed by 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (2HFD) to produce deoxygeniposidic acid, which then undergoes hydrolysis at C-10 to form geniposidic acid. Geniposidic acid undergoes decarboxylation at C-4, catalyzed by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UPD/UGD), to produce bartsioside. Subsequently, hydroxylation occurs at C-6 to form aucubin, and epoxidation with an alcohol at C-10 catalyzed by squalene monooxygenase (SQM) produces catalpol. Finally, anthocyanin acyltransferase (ACT) catalyzes the conversion of catalpol to P-I and P-II.Studies have shown that the picroside content in different tissues of N. kurroa varies. The P-I content in leaf tissues was significantly higher than that in the stems and roots, whereas the P-II content in root tissues was higher than that in leaves. P-I and P-II were present in comparable amounts in the stems. Given that most of the chemical components of N. scrophulariiflora are similar to those of N. kurroa, the study in N. kurroa provided a reference for screening candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of iridoid compounds in N. scrophulariiflora. Owing to differences in taxonomic classification and unique growing environments, N. scrophulariiflora and N. kurroa likely exhibit distinct metabolite compositions and differentially expressed genes. To comprehensively understand the biological characteristics of plants in the genus Neopicrorhiza, conducting transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses is an effective research approach.In this experiment, three different tissues of N. scrophulariiflora, namely, roots, stems, and leaves, were selected as materials. Widely targeted metabolomics and RNA-seq techniques were employed to analyze metabolite profiles in different tissues of N. scrophulariiflora and screen key genes involved in the biosynthesis of iridoid glycosides. This study revealed the potential molecular mechanisms of the iridoid biosynthesis pathway in N. scrophulariiflora and provided important genetic and metabolic information for further investigation in this plant. These findings offer new insights for the conservation and rational utilization of N. scrophulariiflora as a medicinal resource.","Three different parts of N. scrophulariiflora (roots, stems, and leaves) were collected under consistent growth conditions with the same growth status. The collected samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Each transcriptome and metabolome sample was prepared in triplicate.The freeze-dried samples were crushed using a mixer mill (MM 400, Retsch) with a zirconia bead for 1.5 min at 30 Hz. 100 mg of lyophilized powder was dissolved with 1.2 mL of 70% methanol solution, vortexed 30 s every 30 min for six times in total, and the sample was placed in a refrigerator at 4°C overnight. After centrifugation (rotation speed 12,000 rpm, 3 min), the supernatant was aspirated, and the samples were filtered and analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS (UPLC, ExionLC™ AD). The analytical conditions were as follows: UPLC column, Agilent SB-C18 (1.8 µm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A, pure water with 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B, acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Sample measurements were performed using a gradient program that employed starting conditions of 95% A and 5% B. Within 9 min, a linear gradient of 5% A and 95% B was programmed, and a composition of 5% A and 95% B was maintained for 1 min. Subsequently, the composition was adjusted to 95% A and 5.0% B within 1.1 min and kept for 2.9 min. The effluent was alternately connected to an ESI-triple quadrupole linear ion trap (QTRAP)-MS.Metabolite data were log2-transformed for statistical analysis. Metabolites from nine samples were used for hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) using R software (www.r-project.org) to study metabolite accession-specific accumulation. The p and fold change values were set to 0.05 and 2.0, respectively. Venn diagrams were used to determine the number of different metabolites present.Total RNA was extracted from the samples using an RNAprep Pure Plant kit (DP441; Tiangen, China). RNA quality was detected using a NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA), Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA), and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Poly (A) mRNA was enriched using magnetic beads containing oligo (dT). The mRNA was randomly fragmented. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the M-MuLV reverse transcriptase system. The RNA strand was then degraded by RNase H, and the second-strand cDNA was synthesized using DNA polymerase. Double-stranded cDNAs were ligated to the sequencing adapters. The cDNAs (~200 bp) were screened using AMPure XP beads. After amplification and purification, cDNA libraries were obtained and sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system.Raw reads were transformed from raw image data by CASAVA-based recognition. To obtain high-quality data, adapters of sequences were cut, and low-quality reads with ≥5 uncertain bases or with over 50% Qphred ≤20 bases were removed using fastp. The GC content of the clean reads was calculated. The Q20 and Q30 values were also produced by FastQC to evaluate the base quality. Gene expression levels were determined using the fragments per kilobase per million reads (FPKM) method.WGCNA was conducted with normalized read counts of the 31,427 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the R package (WGCNA 1.71, Version-3.5.1) with the following parameters: three biological replicates of three different tissues were used to ensure that the scale-free topology index was >0.8. Topological overlap matrix (TOM)-signed, power β = 14, minimal module size = 30, reassign threshold = 0, and branch merge cut height = 0. The eigengene (the first principal component of a given module) value was calculated and used for association analysis between a module and the measured metabolites from the three different tissues.A hierarchical clustering heatmap was generated by converting normalized expression values into Z-scores using the formula Z = (Log2 (normalized count+1)−mean)/standard deviation. For metabolites, Z-scores were calculated using the same formula; however, the amount of metabolite was used instead of the normalized count.Purified RNA (1 µg for each sample) was reverse-transcribed to first-strand cDNA using a cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix, Takara) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers used to amplify the screened genes, NsSQM1, NsSQM4, NsSQM5, NsUGD5, NsUGD7, NsUPD2, NsUPD3, Ns2HFD4, NsF3D3, NsF3H5, and NsF3H6, were designed by Primer Premier 5 software. 26SrRNA were used as internal reference genes ( Supplementary Table S1 ). qRT-PCR was conducted using a ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix kit (Vazyme) and a C1000 Touch™ Thermal Cycler system (Bio-Rad). Relative transcript levels were calculated according to the 2−ΔΔCt method. Three biological and technical replicates were used for each experiment.","The total ion current (TIC) of the mixed quality control (QC) samples showed the same retention time and peak area ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). Correlation analysis between samples showed good biological repetition, and all QC samples had good reproducibility ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). In this study, nine samples were selected and divided into three groups for metabolomic analysis. A total of 1,085 metabolites were detected and divided into seven groups, namely, phenolic acids, flavonoids, quinones, lignans, alkaloids, terpenes, and other compounds ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). Among them, 196 flavonoids and 63 terpenes were identified ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Principal component analysis (PCA) results showed that root tissues had a different trend of metabolome separation with leaf and stem tissues. Notably, root tissues exhibit a broader divergence in metabolite profiles compared with leaf and stem tissues ( Figure 1A ). Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed on the accumulation patterns of metabolites in different samples ( Supplementary Figure S4 ).In each comparison group, differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) with variable importance in projection (VIP) ≥1 and fold change (FC) ≥2 or ≤0.5 were selected. DAMs in different tissues of N. scrophulariiflora were analyzed. A total of 733 DAMs were obtained from the comparison groups ( Supplementary Table S3 ). The number of DAMs in each group is shown in  Figure 1B , and the DAMs in each comparison group are summarized in  Supplementary Table S4.  620, 570, and 227 DAMs were identified in the root vs. leaf, root vs. stem, and leaf vs. stem comparisons, respectively. In the root vs. leaf comparison, 257 DAMs were upregulated and 363 were downregulated. In the root vs. stem comparison, 215 DAMs were upregulated and 355 were downregulated. In the leaf vs. stem comparison, 66 DAMs were upregulated and 161 were downregulated. These results indicate that the differences in DAMs between root and leaf, as well as root and stem, are relatively large, whereas the differences between leaf and stem are relatively smaller. To investigate the relative changes in DAM abundance across different groups, a K-means clustering analysis was performed. This analysis grouped the DAMs into nine clusters ( Figure 1C ). Among these, 364 metabolites were found to be significantly increased in leaves, the majority of which were phenolic acids and flavonoids, such as gentisic acid, 6-hydroxykaempferol-7-O-glucoside, luteolin-7-O-(6""-malonyl) glucoside, 6""-O-malonylgenistin, quercetin-7-O-(6""-malonyl)glucoside, and tricin-7-O-(6""-O-malonyl) glucoside. In stems, a total of 304 metabolites were significantly increased, most of which were also phenolic acids, such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 6-O-acetylarbutin, 6-[4-(acetyloxymethyl)phenoxy]-4-hydroxyoxane-2-carboxylic acid, gentisic acid 2-O-(6""-O-feruloyl)glucoside, and 1′-O-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)-O-caffeoyl-glucoside. In roots, 274 metabolites were significantly increased, the majority of which were flavonoids and phenolic acids. Notably, 410 metabolites showed significant differences in both the root vs. leaf and root vs. stem comparisons.Further research revealed that there are differences in the content of terpenoid metabolites in N. scrophulariiflora. A total of 63 terpenoid compounds were detected, including 20 iridoid glycosides, 8 monoterpenes, 3 diterpenes, and 29 triterpenes. In the comparison between roots and leaves, 46 terpenoid compounds showed significant differences, with 22 terpenoid compounds upregulated and 24 terpenoid compounds downregulated in the roots ( Supplementary Table S5 ).The content of P-I, P-II, and their presumed precursor substances was measured, revealing that precursor products (such as 7-deoxyloganic acid, vanillic acid, cinnamic acid, and protocatechuic acid) and P-I were significantly higher in leaves and stems than in roots, whereas ferulic acid, 3,4-dimethoxy cinnamic acid, and P-II were higher in roots than in leaves and stems. For example, the P-I content decreased 33-fold in the roots, whereas that of P-II increased 8-fold in the roots. In addition, the precursor compound for picroside synthesis, 7-deoxyloganic acid, decreased 60-fold in the roots.Moreover, the accumulation of the following 10 iridoid glycosides was higher in leaf tissues compared with other samples: rehmannioside J, 8-epiloganic acid, geniposidic acid, acteoside, 8-O-feruloylharpagide, β-ionone, 7-deoxyloganic acid, 6-O-(4-methoxybenzoyl) catalpol, and rehmannioside A. Conversely, the following five iridoid glycosides accumulated more in root tissues than in the others: amphicoside, cistanoside A, picroside-III (6-O-feruloylcatalpol), veronicoside, and rehmannioside B.RNA-seq was used to obtain the transcriptomes of three different tissue samples. Raw data were submitted to NCBI (BioProject ID: PRJNA1171481). After DynamicTrim and LengthSort filtering, the average length and ratio of trimmed to raw reads were 1,010 bp and 97.85%, respectively. A total of 99.16 Gb of clean data was obtained. The Q30 fraction of each sample was greater than or equal to 88.41%. Among transcripts, the most common length range was 300 nt–2,000 nt, with an average length of 1,623 bp ( Figure 2A ). Sequences encoding peptide chains that were too short (less than 50 amino acid residues) or contained only a single exon were filtered out. Moreover, 158,284 genes were mined ( Supplementary Table S6 ).In this experiment, DIAMOND BLASTX software was used to annotate the UniGene sequences with KEGG, NR, Swiss-Prot, GO, COG/KOG, and TrEMBL databases, and finally, 158,284 genes were annotated ( Figure 2B ). Among the 158,284 genes, 113,602 were annotated with at least one hit in the KEGG, NR, SwissProt, GO, COG/KOG, or TrEMBL databases ( Supplementary Table S7 ). Considering the differences in iridoid glycoside content among the three tissue samples, this study investigated three comparison groups, leaf versus root tissue, stem versus leaf tissue, and stem versus root tissue, to screen for DEGs ( Figures 2C, D ). In comparisons between leaf and root tissues, stem and leaf tissues, and stem and root tissues, 25,529 DEGs (10,215 upregulated and 15,314 downregulated), 15,122 DEGs (6,554 upregulated and 8,568 downregulated), and 17,241 DEGs (4,925 upregulated and 12,316 downregulated) were identified, respectively.According to PCA and clustering heat maps, there were significant differences between the different tissues in the transcriptome ( Figure 3A, B ). According to the annotation results of the Nr database, most genes in the N. scrophulariiflora transcriptome had the highest homology with Paulownia fortunei, with 33,645 genes accounting for 31.95%, followed by Buddleja alternifolia, with 8,036 genes accounting for 7.63%. The species with higher homology were all annotated to the Scrophulariaceae family ( Supplementary Figure S5 ). To study the functional relationship between DEGs and their related biological processes, the DEGs were mapped to GO terms. The enriched differentially expressed genes obtained from the analysis consisted of biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF). In the GO analysis of the “biological process” category, the most enriched terms in the upregulated and downregulated DEGs of the three groups were “cellular process” and “metabolic process” ( Supplementary Figure S6 ). According to the KOG database, 106,982 genes were divided into 25 functional categories, with the largest and smallest categories being “general function prediction only” (14,075 genes) and “cell motility” (38 genes), respectively ( Supplementary Figure S7 ).DEGs from the three groups were functionally classified using KEGG pathways. The results showed that the seven main classification pathways for the three groups of DEGs were as follows: “metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides,” “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,” “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis,” “photosynthesis,” “pyruvate metabolism and dicarboxylate metabolism,” “carbon metabolism,” and “porphyrin metabolism” ( Supplementary Figure S8 ). Most genes related to the phenylpropanoid and terpenoid biosynthesis pathways were significantly differentially expressed in all three comparisons. Among the top 20 most enriched pathways in the three comparison groups, “flavonoid biosynthesis,” “flavone and flavonol biosynthesis,” and “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” showed significant enrichment. In the comparison between leaves and roots, most genes in the flavonoid metabolism pathways, especially flavonoid biosynthesis genes, showed significant changes in the roots ( Figure 4 ). For example, NsCHS1, NsFLS1, NsFLS2, NsFNS1, NsCCM1, and NsCCM3 were all significantly and differentially expressed in the roots. In the comparison between stems and roots, most flavonoid pathway genes were upregulated, such as NsC3’H1, NsC3’H2, NsFLS3, NsFLS5, NsHCT13, and NsHCT17; however, some flavonoid compound biosynthesis genes such as NsCHS1 and NsCHI1 were downregulated. Only NsFLS3 and NsFNS1 were downregulated in stems and leaves. In this pathway, metabolites (galangin, prunin, trans-5-O-(p-coumaroyl) shikimate, chlorogenic acid, and apigenin) accumulated significantly in the leaves and stems, which may be related to the high expression of genes in these tissues ( Supplementary Table S8 ).P-I and P-II are the most important secondary metabolites in N. scrophulariiflora and play decisive roles in its hepatoprotective functions. The upstream stages of the iridoid biosynthesis pathway include the MEP and MVA metabolic pathways. In the MEP pathway, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXPR), 2-C-methylerythritol 4- phosphate cytidyl transferase (ISPD), 4-(cytidine-50-diphospho)-2-C-methylerythritol kinase, 2-C-methylerythritol-2,4- cyclophosphate synthase (MECPS), 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (HDS), and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase (ISPH) were expressed at significantly higher levels in leaf tissues than in roots and stems. In the MVA pathway, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (ACTH), hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA synthase (HMGS), hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR), and mevalonate kinase (MVK) expression was significantly higher in the roots and stems than in the leaves ( Figure 5 ).Based on the functional annotation results, 43 genes related to the biosynthesis pathway of iridoid were identified. These 43 genes were categorized into five gene families, namely, 10 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (2HFD) genes, 13 UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UPD/UGD) genes, 10 flavanone 3-hydroxylase/dioxygenase (F3H) genes, 8 squalene monooxygenase (SQM) genes, and 2 anthocyanin acyltransferase (ACT) genes ( Figure 6 ).To further investigate the relationship between genes and metabolites in the leaf, root, and stem tissues, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of the transcriptome and metabolome was performed to identify the co-expressed gene modules and key modules involved in iridoid biosynthesis. Based on the expression patterns, 22 co-expression modules were identified ( Figure 7A ). Among them, 26 genes related to the biosynthetic pathways of iridoids were screened. The analysis examined the correlation between the gene matrices of different modules and the iridoid compound content, with the correlation and corresponding p-values presented numerically in the grid where the modules intersected with the traits. Based on the “module–trait” correlation analysis, the green module was found to be significantly positively correlated with five iridoid glycoside components. This module contained 1,186 genes, three of which were annotated in the iridoid biosynthesis pathway. In addition, the brown module was significantly positively correlated with five other iridoid glycoside components. This module contained 4,989 genes, two of which were annotated to the iridoid biosynthesis pathway.We further explored the correlation between 32,316 DEGs and 11 iridoid metabolites. The results showed that 26 genes were correlated with 11 metabolites in the iridoid pathway ( Figure 7B ). Among them, NsSQM1, Ns2HFD1, and Ns2HFD5 were significantly correlated with P-II, and NsUGD3, NsUPD2, NsUPD3, NsF3H4, and Ns2HFD9 were significantly correlated with P-I and 7-deoxyloganic acid.To further validate the expression profiles of the genes from the Illumina sequencing analysis, 11 genes with high expression levels and large differences in expression were selected for qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR results showed that the relative expression of NsUPD2, NsUPD3, NsSQM4, and NsSQM5 in the leaf tissue was significantly higher than that in the root tissue, and the relative expression of NsF3H6 and NsUGD7 in the root tissue was significantly higher than that in the leaf tissue. The expression patterns of the 11 genes were consistent with the sequencing data, indicating that the RNA-Seq data were reliable ( Figure 8 ).A phylogenetic analysis of four gene families was conducted, namely, F3D/F3H, 2HFD, UGD/UPD, and SQM. For comparison, the results indicated that one gene, Ns2HFD1, was classified as a 2HFD gene responsible for converting mussaenosidic acid to deoxygeniposidic acid. Ns2HFD1 is more closely related to the 2HFD gene in Glycine max ( Supplementary Figure S10 ). The other three genes NsF3D3, NsF3H5, and NsF3H6, were classified as F3H/F3D genes responsible for converting bartsioside to aucubin or converting 7-deoxyloganic acid to mussaenosidic acid. NsF3D3, NsF3H5, and NsF3H6 are more closely related to the F3H genes in plants such as Echinacea purpurea and Glycine max ( Supplementary Figure S9 ).UGD/UPD is the enzyme required to convert geniposidic acid to aucubin, whereas SQM is required to epoxidize aucubin further to generate catalpol. To determine whether the DEGs found in the transcriptome had UGD or SQM functions, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of known UGD/UPD and SQM. The results showed that four genes NsUPD2, NsUPD3, NsUGD5, and NsUGD7 classified as UGD/UPD, NsUPD3, NsUGD5, and NsUGD7, respectively, are more closely related to the UGD gene in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Supplementary Figure S11 ). Three genes NsSQM1, NsSQM4, and NsSQM5 classified as SQM, NsSQM1, NsSQM4, and NsSQM5, respectively, are more closely related to the TwSQM1 in Tripterygium wilfordii ( Supplementary Figure S12 ). In summary, we speculate that these 11 genes may be functional genes responsible for the synthesis of P-I and P-II."," Neopicrorhiza scrophulariiflora (Pennell) D.Y.Hong is a perennial medicinal plant with a long history of various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antibacterial properties. Due to limited research on N. scrophulariiflora, the understanding of this plant is insufficient. To better protect and rationally utilize N. scrophulariiflora resources, it is necessary to conduct a combined analysis of its transcriptome and metabolome. Metabolomics is an effective tool for measuring metabolite composition in various plant tissues. Widely targeted metabolomics techniques have been used to identify and quantify metabolites in different plant species at different developmental stages and in other organs. The flavonoid component with the highest content in roots is isohyperoside, whereas the one with the highest content in leaves is 6-hydroxykaempferol-7-O-glucoside. Among the terpenoid compounds, P-II was the most abundant in roots, whereas P-I was the most abundant in leaves. Metabolomic analysis has identified several other iridoid glycosides besides P-I and P-II, including picrogentiosides B, picrosides IV, verminoside, specioside, and 6-feruloylcatalpol. In addition, several newly discovered compounds have been identified in N. scrophulariiflora, including amphicicide 8-O-feruloylharpagide, veronicoside, harpagoside, and rehmannioside B. However, the precursor compounds of P-I and P-II, aucubin and catalpol, may not have been detected due to their low content. It is worth noting that research on flavonoid compounds in N. scrophulariiflora is scarce, possibly because the underground parts (root tissues) are typically the focus of medicinal research, and there are almost no flavonoids in the roots. The aerial parts (leaf tissues), rich in flavonoids, have been studied less. Therefore, conducting metabolite analysis on the leaf tissues of N. scrophulariiflora is particularly important. According to the joint analysis of transcriptome and metabolome, in leaf and stem tissues, the accumulation of flavonoids increased, which may be due to the high expression of NsCHS1, NsFLS1, NsFLS2, NsHCT4, NsHCT17, NsC3′H1, and NsC3′H3 genes in these tissues.Iridoid glycosides are a class of compounds widely distributed in plants and can be further divided into iridoid alcohols, iridoid glycosides, and seco-iridoids based on their skeletal structures. P-I and P-II are the main pharmacologically active components of the iridoid glycosides found in N. scrophulariiflora. This study further explored the tissue-specific accumulation of P-I and P-II in N. scrophulariiflora. The results showed that iridoid glycosides exhibited different distribution patterns in various tissues of N. scrophulariiflora. P-I mainly accumulates in the leaf tissues, whereas P-II mainly accumulates in the root tissues. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the content of iridoid glycosides in N. kurroa also confirmed that the content of P-I was higher in the leaves, whereas the content of P-II was higher in the roots, which is consistent with the results of the present study. Based on this, we further analyzed the tissue specificity of the other compounds in N. scrophulariiflora. We found that flavonoids and phenolic acids primarily accumulated in the leaves and stems, whereas alkaloids, lignans, and coumarins mainly accumulated in the roots. Traditionally, the dried roots of N. scrophulariiflora have been used for medicinal purposes. However, the experimental results indicate that the leaves of N. scrophulariiflora also contain picrosides, with a particularly high concentration of P-I. This finding provides new perspectives and directions for studying the metabolic components of this plant. This not only helps to deepen the scientific understanding of N. scrophulariiflora but also promotes the conservation and sustainable utilization of its resources.Although P-I and P-II have important medicinal values, their biosynthetic pathways in N. scrophulariiflora have not been clearly elucidated. The investigation of the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway in N. kurroa revealed that the expression levels of 2HFD, SQM, and DCH genes were significantly higher in leaf tissue than in root tissue. In contrast, the expression levels of F3D, UGD, UPD, and ACT genes were significantly higher in root tissue than in leaf tissue. Our findings align with the gene expression patterns reported for the iridoid biosynthesis pathway in N. kurroa. In root tissues, a significant accumulation of P-II was observed, which is likely associated with the high expression of the NsACT1, NsACT2, NsUGD7, NsUPD2, NsUPD3, and NsF3H6 genes. Conversely, in leaf tissues, a significant accumulation of P-I was detected, potentially attributed to the high expression of the NsSQM4, NsSQM5, and Ns2HFD3 genes. Further functional studies in plants are necessary to comprehensively elucidate and confirm the biosynthetic pathways of these iridoid glycosides.The results of the phylogenetic analysis (( Supplementary Figure S9 -( Supplementary Figure S12 )indicate that NsF3D3, NsF3H5, and NsF3H6 are more closely related to the F3H genes in plants such as Echinacea purpurea and Glycine max. As a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily in Echinacea purpurea, F3H catalyzes NADPH- and O2-dependent monooxygenase reactions. During anthocyanin biosynthesis, F3H specifically hydroxylates the 3′-position of the B-ring in naringenin and dihydrokaempferol (DHK) to yield eriodictyol and dihydroquercetin (DHQ), respectively. These intermediates play essential roles in the subsequent biosynthesis of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. The evolutionary tree analysis indicates that NsF3D3, NsF3H5, and NsF3H6 catalyze the conversion of 8-epideoxyloganic acid to mussaenosidic acid in the biosynthetic pathway of N. scrophulariiflora iridoid glycosides; Ns2HFD1 is more closely related to the 2HFD gene in Glycine max. During isoflavone biosynthesis in Glycine max, 2HFD catalyzes the dehydration of 2,5,7,4′-tetrahydroxyisoflavones or 2,7,4′-trihydroxyisoflavones, forming a double bond between C-2 and C-3 to yield genistein or daidzein, respectively. Ns2HFD1 catalyzes the conversion of mussaenosidic acid to deoxygeniposidic acid in the biosynthetic pathway of N. scrophulariiflora iridoid glycosides; NsUPD2, NsUPD3, NsUGD5, and NsUGD7 are more closely related to the UGD gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the biosynthesis pathway of Arabidopsis xylan, UGD irreversibly catalyzes the decarboxylation of UDP glucuronic acid (UDP GlcA) to form UDP Xyl. NsUPD2, NsUPD3, NsUGD5, and NsUGD7 catalyze the conversion of geniposidic acid to bartsioside in the iridoid glycoside biosynthesis pathway of N. scrophulariiflora. Similarly, NsSQM1, NsSQM4, and NsSQM5 are involved in the biosynthetic pathway of iridoid glycosides in N. scrophulariiflora, specifically catalyzing the conversion of aucubin to catalpol. In summary, through phylogenetic tree analysis, the genes identified in this experiment are hypothesized to participate in the downstream pathway of iridoid glycoside biosynthesis in N. scrophulariiflora.","In this study, a widely targeted metabolomics approach was employed to identify 1,085 metabolites from three different tissues of N. scrophulariiflora, including 196 flavonoids and 63 terpenoids. The analysis revealed significant differences in flavonoid and iridoid glycoside content among the three tissues. To further understand the biosynthetic mechanisms underlying these differences, transcriptome data from these tissues were analyzed. A total of 61.63 Gb of clean data were obtained. The Q30 fraction of each sample was greater than or equal to 88.41%. By applying various bioinformatics methods such as differential expression gene (DEG) analysis, KEGG and GO enrichment analysis, clustering analysis, phylogenetic tree construction, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), 43 candidate genes involved in P-I and P-II biosynthesis were successfully identified. Among these, 26 genes were significantly correlated with picroside content and their intermediate products. Furthermore, analysis of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway revealed that genes related to flavonoid synthesis were highly expressed in the leaves and stems. Finally, 11 candidate genes were validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), including NsSQM1, NsSQM4, NsSQM5, NsUGD5, NsUGD7, NsUPD2, NsUPD3, Ns2HFD4, NsF3D3, NsF3H5, and NsF3H6. We speculate that these genes may be involved in the biosynthetic pathway of iridoid glycosides, and their functions will be further validated in subsequent studies. The results of this study contribute to a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the composition and dynamic changes in iridoid compounds in N. scrophulariiflora and elucidate the molecular regulatory mechanisms of iridoid compound synthesis. The work lays the foundation for further development and utilization of the medicinal value of N. scrophulariiflora."
81,TA039632,10.1002/iid3.70015,Efficacy and mechanism of action of ginsenoside Rg3 on radiation proctitis inrats.,"OBJECTIVE: Radiation proctitis (RP) refers to rectal injury caused by radiationtreatment of pelvic and retroperitoneal malignancies, which has a major impact onthe treatment prognosis and quality of life of patients with cancer. Thetetracyclic triterpene saponin monomer ginsenoside Rg3 (GRg3), the primarybioactive ingredient in ginseng extracts, has therapeutic effects against RP inrats. Here, we validated its efficacy and elucidated its mechanism of action.METHODS: A rat RP model was established in 48 Wistar rats. Rats were randomlydivided into control (untreated), irradiation, irradiation + dexamethasone, andirradiation + GRg3 (low-, medium-, and high-dose) groups. After 2 weeks'treatment, serum IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-α levels were tested by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assays. In rectal tissue, Ikbkb, Ikka, and Casp8 mRNA expressionwas detected by a reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.IKK-β, IκB-α, p-IκB-α, p50, and caspase-8 protein levels were determined bywestern blot analysis. RESULTS: GRg3 significantly improved the general conditionand histopathological damage in rats with RP. Moreover, GRg3 decreased the levelsof factors that promote inflammation (TNF-α) and increased the levels of factorsthat reduce inflammation (IL-4 and IL-10). GRg3 markedly reduced the activationof NF-κB and caspase-8 signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, GRg3 may reduce theinflammatory response by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway and improving thebalance of inflammation-related factors. GRg3 may also inhibit intestinal cellapoptosis by suppressing the TNF-α/caspase-8 signaling cascade, thereby reducingradiological rectal injury. Our results verify that GRg3 is a promisingtherapeutic agent for RP treatment and shed light on its mechanism.","Li, Xuxia, Lin, Lili, Duan, Xiaoyu, Dai, Jiuju, Hu, Tingting, Cai, Hongyi",2024,"Immunity, inflammation and disease",2,False,False,True,"Radiotherapy is an important component of the multidisciplinary and comprehensive treatment model for pelvic and abdominal malignancies. Due to the fixed anatomical position of the rectum at the edge of the pelvis, which is close to the irradiated organs subjected to radiotherapy, rectal injury caused by ionizing radiation is one of the most common complications of pelvic and abdominal radiotherapy, which is also known as radiation proctitis (RP). Approximately 75% of all patients treated with pelvic radiotherapy suffer from acute RP (ARP) symptoms, including abdominal pain and diarrhea, urgency of bowel movements, and myxoid secretions. Although most ARP symptoms resolve after discontinuing radiotherapy, up to 20% of patients may develop chronic RP (CRP) or more severe outcomes such as intestinal fistula and hemorrhage, thereby requiring radiotherapy interruption, which seriously affects the efficacy of treatment and reduces the survival rate. Clinical treatment for RP is mostly aimed at resolving acute and chronic symptoms, but long‐term treatment can also produce side effects such as drug dependence and constipation; as a result, there is an urgent need to develop a new therapeutic avenue to address the etiology of RP.Ginsenoside Rg3 (GRg3), a tetracyclic triterpenoid saponin monomer, is the main bioactive component of ginseng extract, and its chemical structure is shown in Figure 1. It is commonly used clinically in the adjuvant treatment of tumor related diseases. In addition to directly exerting antitumor effects, GRg3 can also improve the sensitivity of tumors to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Previous study showed that GRg3 has a therapeutic effect on radiation‐induced RP in rats. This study aimed to further validate its efficacy and mechanism that will hopefully provide a theoretical basis for future clinical applications.","Shenyi (GRg3) capsules were purchased from Jilin Yatai Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd. Sodium pentobarbital was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., and 0.9% saline and dexamethasone sodium phosphate injections were provided by the Radiotherapy Department of Gansu Provincial Hospital. Anti‐caspase‐8, ‐β‐actin, and ‐proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibodies were purchased from Boster Biological Technology Co., Ltd. Anti‐IκB‐α, ‐IKK‐β, and ‐NF‐κB p50 antibodies were purchased from Proteintech Group. The anti‐phosphorylated (p)‐IκB‐α antibody was purchased from Signalway Antibody LLC. The enzyme standards were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The linear gas pedals were purchased from Siemens.Forty‐eight male Wistar rats (license number: SYXK [Gan] 2013‐0003), weighing approximately 180–200 mg, were acclimatized in the experimental animal room of the Gansu Provincial People's Hospital for 7 days before experiments commenced. The ambient temperature was maintained at 21–27°C, relative humidity at 50%–60%, and airflow velocity at 20 cm2/s, with air changes occurring 15 times/min. The rats were fed a maintenance diet, allowed to drink freely, and subjected to 12 h of alternating light and dark conditions. The experiments were conducted in compliance with the rules and regulations of the Medical Ethics Committee of Gansu Provincial Hospital (2022‐429, approved on January 11, 2023). All sections of this report adhere to the ARRIVE Guidelines for reporting animal research. A completed ARRIVE guidelines checklist is included in supplementary materials (Checklist S1).The rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, irradiation (IR), irradiation + dexamethasone treatment (IR + DEX), and irradiation + low‐dose GRg3‐treatment (IR+low‐dose GRg3), medium‐dose GRg3 treatment (IR+medium‐dose GRg3), and high‐dose GRg3 treatment (IR+high‐dose GRg3). Except for the control group, all groups were anesthetized with 3% pentobarbital sodium at a dose of 40 mg/kg after 12 h of fasting before irradiation. After anesthesia, the rats were fixed in a supine position on a wooden board after their limbs were completely relaxed. Irradiation was performed using 6 MV X‐rays at a dose rate of 300 cGy/min and an irradiation dose of 21.5 Gy. Rats were irradiated from the pubic symphysis to the anus, which was not surrounded by the lead block. After irradiation, the rats were released from fixation, kept warm to avoid hypothermic death, and transported to the experimental animal room for further feeding after they awakened. Successful modeling was based on the presence of decreased mental and dietary status, body weight, and changes in stool characteristics, such as black, mucus‐like, or loose stools.Treatments were administered to the rats by gavage at the same time every day for 14 days, starting from the 8th day after modeling. Dexamethasone concentrations were selected based on a previous study by Wang et al., and GRg3 concentrations were derived from a previous work. The control and IR groups were administered saline at 40 mL/kg per day; the IR + DEX group was administered dexamethasone solution at 1.425 mg/kg. For the GRg3 groups, a 4 mg/mL GRg3 suspension was prepared and administered to the low‐, medium‐, and high‐dose GRg3‐treatment groups at 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg, respectively.The rats were observed for daily food and water intake, fecal changes, voluntary activity, and reaction speed, and were weighed and recorded at the same time each day. After 2 weeks' treatment, rats were anesthetized, and 5 mL of abdominal aortic blood was collected. Rats were then executed and dissected. Approximately 4 cm of rectal tissue was collected, 2 cm above the anus. The rectal tissue was split along the longitudinal axis, washed in saline, and excess water was absorbed using filter paper. One part of the tissue specimen was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for pathological section observation, and the other was transferred to a −80°C freezer with liquid nitrogen in lyophilization tubes as backup samples.ELISAs were used to test the serum IL‐4, IL‐10, and TNF‐α levels in each group of rats. Rat IL‐4, IL‐10, and TNF‐α ELISA kits (Lanzhou Kebao Biological Company) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analyses were performed using the DS‐11 ultra‐microspectrophotometer (DeNovix).Total RNA was extracted using TRIeasyTM total RNA extraction kits (Lanzhou Kebao Biological Company). Reverse transcription kits were purchased from Lanzhou Kebao Biological Company, and the mRNA expression levels of Ikbkb, Ikba, and Casp8 were detected by RT‐qPCR using the PTC‐200 reverse transcription PTC‐200 thermocycler (Bio‐Rad) and a fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument (Roche).Cytoplasmic and nucleolar proteins were extracted using nucleoprotein and plasma protein extraction kits (Shenyang Wanlei Biotechnology Company) according to the manufacturer's instructions. IKK‐β, IκB‐α, p‐IκB‐α, p50, and caspase‐8 protein contents were determined by western blot analysis using fluorescence quantification kits (Lanzhou Kebao Biological Company) and a gel imager (Bio‐Rad).SPSS software (version 24.0; IBM SPSS Inc.) was used for data analysis and processing. ImageJ software (NIH) was used for image analysis. GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Inc.) was used to create the graphs. Quantitative data with a normal distribution were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. A one‐way analysis of variance was used to compare groups. As post hoc tests, the Bonferroni test was employed when the variance was equal, and Dunnett's T3 test was used when it was not. A P‐value of <0.05 was deemed statistically significant.","The rats in the control group were in good general condition, responsive, and had normal mental and activity statuses. Feeding and drinking gradually increased with body weight; the rats' fur was neat and lustrous, and their excrement was granular. On Days 3–5 after irradiation, experimental rats began to show different degrees of RP symptoms. Five rats had black stools, 16 had myxoid stools, eight had paste‐like stools, and five had loose stools. Three rats developed cachexia. Compared with the control group, the food and water intake and activity of rats in the experimental groups were significantly reduced. These rats preferred to huddle in corners. When grasped, the rats offered weak resistance. Their perianal fur was dirty and partially shed. One cachectic rat died on the 6th day after irradiation. On the 8th day, treatment by oral gavage was started. The rats in the control group ate as usual, whereas the rats in the IR group had decreased food and water intake and showed the most severe enteritis symptoms. After 8 days of saline gavage, the amount of food consumed in the IR group was approximately half of that before gavage treatment. The dexamethasone‐ and GRg3‐treated rats showed no significant changes in status during the first 3 days of treatment. From the 4th day, the rats' feeding and drinking gradually increased, and their feces gradually normalized. Compared with the IR group, after 2 weeks of gavage, rats in the high‐dose GRg3‐treatment group showed significantly improved mood and activity, and their hair became shiny. During the gavage treatment period, one rat in each of the IR and low‐dose GRg3‐treatment groups died.Before irradiation, body weight did not differ between the groups (p > 0.05). Six days postirradiation, the weight of rats in each experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05) but did not differ across the experimental groups (p > 0.05). After gavage treatment, the body weight of the control group rats gradually increased by 2–3 g per day, whereas that of rats in the IR group continuously decreased. The weight of the rats in the groups treated with GRg3 and dexamethasone showed no significant change during the first 3 days of treatment but gradually increased from the 4th day by 1–3 g per day. Compared with the IR group, the body weight of the rats in the dexamethasone‐treatment group and the high‐dose GRg3‐treatment group was significantly increased by the 8th and 14th days of treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05) (Table 1).Histopathology of the rectal tissues is shown in Figure 2. In the control group, the rectal tissue structure was evident, the mucosal epithelium remained intact, the intestinal glands were numerous and closely spaced, and no obvious abnormalities were found in the mucosal layer. Compared with the control group, the rectal tissues in the IR group were extensively ulcerated, many intestinal glands had been replaced by hyperplastic connective tissue, some of the intestinal glands were dilated, and necrotic cell fragments were observed in the lumen. More lymphocytes were found in the mucosal layer, with severe submucosal edema and bleeding.The rectal tissues of the dexamethasone‐treatment group showed slight inflammatory cell infiltration in the mucosal layer; otherwise, the tissues were structurally unaltered. In the low‐dose GRg3‐treatment group, the rectal tissues showed extensive ulceration, the shape and size of the intestinal glands were altered, the number was reduced, and some intestinal glands were dilated, with necrotic cell fragments visible in the lumen. The damage invaded the submucosa, and the mucosal, submucosal, and muscle layers showed significant infiltration of inflammatory cells. Pathological intestinal sections of mice in the middle‐dose GRg3‐treatment group showed a small number of necrotic and detached mucosal epithelial cells. The intestinal glands had different shapes and sizes, necrotic cell debris was observed in the gland cavity, and moderate inflammatory cell infiltration was observed around the intestinal glands. In the high‐dose GRg3 group, the rectal tissue structure was intact, the mucosal layer was edematous, and the intestinal glands were loosely arranged, with inflammatory cell infiltration.Serum TNF‐α levels were increased and IL‐4 and IL‐10 levels were decreased in the IR group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Serum TNF‐α levels were decreased and those of IL‐4 and IL‐10 were increased in the dexamethasone‐treatment group and the high‐dose GRg3‐treatment group compared with the IR rats (p < 0.05) (Figure 3).RT‐qPCR results showed that the Ikbkb, Ikba, and Casp8 mRNA expression levels in the rectal tissues of rats in the IR group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.01). After different interventions, the Ikbkb, Ikba, and Casp8 mRNA levels in each treatment group decreased compared with the IR group (p < 0.05), and the expression of each of these factors tended to decrease with increasing GRg3 treatment doses. The differences in Ikbkb, Ikba, and Casp8 mRNA expression between the dexamethasone‐treated group and the high‐dose GRg3‐treatment group were not statistically significant (p > 0.05) (Figure 4).Western blot analysis results showed that IKK‐β, p‐IκB‐α, nucleolar NF‐κB p50, and caspase‐8 protein levels were significantly higher in the rectal tissues of rats in the IR group than in those of the control group, whereas IκB‐α and nucleolar NF‐κB p50 protein levels were lower (p < 0.05). After treatment, IKK‐β, p‐IκB‐α, nucleolar NF‐κB p50, and caspase‐8 protein levels were decreased in the dexamethasone and medium‐ and high‐dose GRg3‐treatment groups compared with the IR group (p < 0.01), whereas IκB‐α and nucleolar NF‐κB p50 protein levels were significantly increased (p < 0.05). The protein levels of each factor were similar between the medium‐ and high‐dose GRg3‐treatment groups and the dexamethasone‐treatment group (p > 0.05) (Figure 5).","Herein, we validated the efficacy of GRg3, the primary bioactive ingredient in ginseng extracts, against RP in rats and elucidated its mechanism of action. We revealed that GRg3 reduces the inflammatory response via the NF‐κB signaling pathway and inhibits intestinal cell apoptosis via the TNF‐α/caspase‐8 signaling cascade, thereby reducing rectal injury.Research on the pharmacological mechanisms of action of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gradually deepened. Compared with chemical and biological drugs, TCM has unique advantages, such as fewer adverse effects and complex compositions involving multiple components with multiple targets. Ginseng is an herbal TCM that has been used for over 2000 years. It is an important TCM tonic with extensive medicinal value. GRg3, with the molecular formula C42H72O13, inhibits tumor angiogenesis, regulates the tumor cell cycle, and improves chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity. Several studies have revealed that GRg3 exerts potent anti‐inflammatory effects. It induces M2 macrophage polarization to accelerate inflammation regression and to inhibit mast cell‐mediated allergic inflammation via the MAPK/NF‐κB signaling pathway. In sepsis models, GRg3 exerts protective mitochondrial effects by activating the AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, which promotes mitochondrial autophagy. AMPK serves as a target for GRg3‐induced mitochondrial autophagy and alleviates oxidative stress, thereby protecting cells and organs from sepsis‐induced damage. As ARP is essentially an inflammatory response and GRg3 can exert anti‐inflammatory effects through multiple pathways, it is plausible that GRg3 would have a therapeutic effect on radiation enteritis.The inflammatory process induced by ionizing radiation is the primary cellular defense mechanism and is accompanied by the production of multiple pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory factors. An imbalance in inflammation‐related cytokine levels after radiation can cause continuous damage to cells and tissues. TNF‐α is an inflammatory cytokine involved in the acute phase inflammatory response and is mainly produced by activated macrophages. TNF‐α levels are significantly increased in the serum of patients with RP and in the rectal tissues of RP rat models. IL‐4 and IL‐10, anti‐inflammatory cytokines, are secreted by Th2 cells and downregulate the inflammatory response by preventing Th1 cell proliferation, blocking pro‐inflammatory cytokine production, and reducing the function of antigen‐presenting cells. Hong et al. showed that TNF‐α levels were increased and IL‐4 and IL‐10 levels were decreased in the intestinal mucosa of RP model rats. Radiation disrupts the balance of pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory factors in the gut to trigger RP, consistent with our results using RP model rat serum. GRg3 was recently shown to have a good curative effect on arthritis, neuritis, pneumonia, nephritis, and other inflammatory diseases; however, the mechanism of its anti‐inflammatory effects has been unclear. By establishing ARP rat models and GRg3 gavage treatment, we showed that GRg3 not only improved the general condition of RP rats, including their mood, appetite, and body weight, but also significantly reduced histopathological intestinal mucosal damage. The mechanism may be related to improved inflammation‐related cytokine balance, as we found that the serum pro‐inflammatory cytokine TNF‐α levels were decreased and those of anti‐inflammatory factors IL‐4 and IL‐10 were increased in rats in the medium‐ and high‐dose GRg3‐treatment groups. The IR group's weight increased during the late gavage stage, possibly because the ARP phase had passed and rats were recovering from the disease. This recovery indicates that ARP has self‐limiting properties. However, the weight of rats in the medium‐ and high‐dose GRg3‐treatment groups was still significantly higher than that in the IR group (p < 0.05), and the histopathological results and serum inflammatory indices also proved that GRg3 had significant therapeutic effects on ARP model rats.Activation of NF‐κB is important in cellular inflammatory injury and immune responses. Under normal conditions, both NF‐κB and IκB exist in the cytoplasm in inactive forms. Therefore, selective inhibition of NF‐κB signaling pathway activation is a target for inflammatory disease treatment. Drugs that are widely used clinically to regulate NF‐κB activity include glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, and certain anti‐rheumatic drugs. Glucocorticoids can increase NF‐κB retention in the cytoplasm by inducing transcription and synthesis of IκB‐α, sulfasalazine can directly inhibit nuclear translocation of NF‐κB, and high‐dose aspirin can inhibit IKK activity. GRg3 has been confirmed to play a therapeutic role in various diseases by regulating the NF‐κB signaling pathway. Ma et al. showed that GRg3 can reduce hypertrophic scar formation in rabbit ears by inhibiting p‐IκB activity. In human inflammatory airway epithelial cells and asthmatic airway epithelial tissues, GRg3 reduces inflammatory factor secretion by downregulating NF‐κB activity. Additionally, GRg3 can inhibit colon cancer cell migration and proliferation by inhibiting the activity of NF‐κB. In this study, RT‐qPCR and western blot analysis were used to detect the changes in expression of NF‐κB pathway‐related factors in the rectal tissue of ARP rats. The results suggested that GRg3 may improve the balance of inflammatory factors by inhibiting the expression of IKK‐β, reducing the phosphorylation of IκB‐α, and increasing the retention of NF‐κB p50 in the cytoplasm. Thus, it reduces the inflammatory response and promotes the repair of intestinal tissue damage.Recent studies have shown that GRg3 can inhibit apoptosis. Lee et al. found that GRg3 treatment downregulated apoptotic factors p53, BAX, and cleaved caspase‐3 in a Huntington's disease cell model. Hu et al. suggested that GRg3 exerts a protective effect against H2O2‐induced hippocampal neuronal injury in mice by downregulating the expression of caspase‐3. Apoptosis, a biological process essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis in the human body, is initiated and executed by cysteine proteases. Under different conditions, ionizing radiation induces cell death via different signal transduction mechanisms. However, as an initiator of apoptosis, activation of caspase‐8 is crucial and is an important factor in preventing radiation‐induced damage. Furthermore, GRg3 can significantly reduce the level of the apoptotic protein BAX. The present experiment verified that the mRNA and protein levels of caspase‐8 in rat rectal tissues were significantly reduced after GRg3 intervention, indicating that GRg3 can inhibit the apoptosis of intestinal cells induced by ionizing radiation. Additionally, TNF‐α levels were also significantly decreased in rats after GRg3 treatment. Thus, GRg3 may alleviate radiation‐induced rectal injury by inhibiting the TNF‐α/caspase‐8 signaling cascade and inhibiting intestinal cell apoptosis.This study has some shortcomings. For example, the observation of the general condition of rats is subjective to some extent, and the judgment of rectal injury is only a qualitative analysis, which needs to be further quantified to improve the accuracy of the experiment. In addition, whether the RP application of GRg3 conflicts with its antitumor effect needs further experimental verification.In conclusion, GRg3 can reduce rectal tissue damage in RP model rats through NF‐κB and TNF‐α/caspase‐8 signaling pathways, exerting anti‐inflammatory effects and inhibiting apoptosis, thereby reducing the severity of RP. Thus, GRg3 is a promising therapeutic agent for RP. In the future, the effect of GRg3 on the interaction between NF‐κB and caspase‐8 signaling pathways can be further elucidated by studying the molecular mechanism of the interaction.",

Here, we found thatthe essential oil (EO) extracted from E. densa possesses obvious effects againstthe insects that threaten stored-products. In this work, we investigated thechemical constituents of the essential oil extracted from Elsholtzia densa, andtheir insecticidal (contact and fumigant) toxicity against Tribolium castaneumand Lasioderma serricorne. A total of 45 compounds were identified by GC-MS,accounting for 98.74% of the total EO. Meanwhile, 11 compounds were isolated fromthe EO, including limonene, β-caryophyllene, ρ-cymene, trans-phytol, α-terpineol,linalool, acetophenone, 1,8-cineole, ρ-cymen-7-ol, 1-O-cerotoylgly-cerol, andpalmitic acid. Furthermore, acetophenone, ρ-cymen-7-ol, and 1-O-cerotoylgly-cerolwere isolated for the first time from Elsholtzia spp. The results of thebioassays indicated that the EO had the property of insecticidal toxicity againstT. castaneum and L. serricorne. All of the compounds showed different levels ofinsecticidal toxicity against the two species of insects. Among them,2-ethyl-1H-imidazole had no insecticidal toxicity against T. castaneum, butpossessed fumigant and obvious contact toxicity against L. serricorne.ρ-Cymen-7-ol had beneficial insecticidal toxicity against the two species ofinsects, and fumigant toxicity against L. serricorne. ρ-Cymen-7-ol (LD(50) =13.30 μg/adult), 1-octen-3-ol (LD(50) = 13.52 μg/adult), and 3-octanol (LD(50) =17.45 μg/adult) showed significant contact toxicity against T. castaneum.Acetophenone (LD(50) = 7.07 μg/adult) and ρ-cymen-7-ol (LD(50) = 8.42 μg/adult)showed strong contact toxicity against L. serricorne. ρ-Cymene (LC(50) = 10.91mg/L air) and ρ-cymen-7-ol (LC(50) = 10.47 mg/L air) showed powerful fumiganttoxicity to T. castaneum. Limonene (LC(50) = 5.56 mg/L air), acetophenone (LC(50)= 5.47 mg/L air), and 3-octanol (LC(50) = 5.05 mg/L air) showed obvious fumiganttoxicity against L. serricorne. In addition, the EO and its chemical compoundspossessed different levels of repellent activity. This work provides someevidence of the value of exploring these materials for insecticidal activity, forhuman health purposes. We suggest that the EO extracted from E. densa may havethe potential to be developed as an insecticidal agent against stored productinsect pests.","Liang, Junyu, Shao, Yazhou, Wu, Haoshu, An, Yue, Wang, Junlong, Zhang, Ji, Kong, Weibao",2021,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"As the world’s population continues to grow, the demand for food crops is increasing every year. However, a major difficulty in the production and storage of cereal products, grains, and Chinese herbs is insect infestation. Pests are a problem worldwide because of migration, high reproductive rates, and wide distribution. Insect pests play an important role in damaging crops, causing both direct and indirect economic loss. These insect pests are active throughout the year on various crops, and are associated with a loss of more than one billion US dollars per year worldwide. Traditional methods of pest control are dependent on chemical synthetic insecticides, because they are highly efficient. However, the repeated use of synthetic chemicals to manage pests has resulted in resurgence and outbreaks, resistance to insecticides, the elimination of existing natural enemies, and the pollution of soil, water, air and food. It is necessary to reduce the risks associated with the excessive application of high pesticide doses in agricultural primary production. The growing awareness of the hazards of excessive use of pesticides globally has led researchers to search for safer and more environmentally friendly alternative methods for insect pest control. Hence, the search for viable and sustainable alternatives to synthetic pesticides is vital. Plants have chemical defense mechanisms against insects and other organisms; these defense mechanisms do not generally produce immediate death, but do affect common biochemical and physiological functions. Botanical pesticides tend to have broad-spectrum activity, are relatively specific in their mode of action, and are generally safe to other living organisms and the environment. Therefore, botanical pesticides have been frequently discussed in recent years. Research on natural products that could be alternatives to synthetic pesticides and fungicides, for example plant extracts and essential oils, has therefore greatly increased during recent years.Natural product essential oils (EOs) are extracted from aromatic plants, and consist of terpenes, aromatics, and phenolic components. EOs are generally considered environmentally and medically safe because of their volatility. EOs may significantly reduce the harmfulness of some pests, and thus be worth further attention. There are some reports that EOs possess a wide range of curative potentials, such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, antifeedant, and insecticidal activities. Among them, the antifeedant and insecticidal activities of many plant extracts, and their bioactive compounds against several insect pests, have been demonstrated. Wang et al. reported that there are obvious toxicity and repellent activities of EOs and their major compounds from four spice plants, against two storage product insects (T. castaneum and L. serricorne). EOs and polyacetylene extracted from Artemisia ordosica possess significant fumigant toxicity and repellent activity against T. castaneum, and five polyacetylenes were isolated from Artemisia ordosica. EOs and their compounds extracted from Valerianaceae spp, Murraya tetramera Huang, Zanthoxylum planispinumvar. Dintanensis, and Valeriana officinalis have also been demonstrated to possess potential activity against stored product insects. Plant-derived extracts can also control pests as antifeedant agents.Elsholtzia bensa belongs to Elsholtzia Willd. It is a widely spread plant in China. E. Bensa has antibacterial and antiviral properties that make it excellent for use in the treatment of diseases. However, E. densa is regarded as a weed in many provinces of China. In this work, the chemical compounds of an EO extracted from E. densa were analyzed by GC-MS. We chose T. castaneum and L. serricorne as target insects to evaluate the insecticidal and repellent activity of this EO and its compounds. We expected to find efficacy of E. densa, both as an insecticide and repellent, against storage pests.","The fresh aerial parts of E. densa were collected from Longxi county, Gansu Province, China (35°1′23″ N latitude, 104°27′17″ E longitude, altitude 1904.7 m) in September 2019. The botanical authentication was performed by Dr. Liang, J. Y. (College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, China), and a voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium (NWNU) of the College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, under the number NWNU-20190918002. After the aerial parts of E. densa were air-dried at room temperature in the shade, they were cut into small pieces. The EO of E. densa were obtained by hydrodistillation for 6 h on a modified Clevenger-type apparatus, and stored in dark airtight containers in a refrigerator at 4 °C.T. castaneum and L. serricorne were provided by the laboratory of quality research and product development of traditional Chinese medicine, College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, and were confirmed by Dr. Liang J. Y. (College of Life Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, China). The two kinds of insects were artificially subcultured and purified for more than 4 to 5 generations in dark incubator at 28–30 °C, with relative humidity maintained at 70–80%. They were reared on a mixture of wheat flour and yeast (10:1, w/w). The mixed-sex adult insects used in all bioassays were about 1–2 weeks old.This was carried out according to the method reported previously. The chemical compounds of the EO were analyzed by GC-MS. The column of the GC was a quartz capillary column HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm), the temperature was 250 °C, high purity helium was used as the carrier gas, the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, the injection volume was 1.0 μL, and the split ratio was 100:1. The heating program was set as follows: the initial temperature was 60 °C and was maintained for 2 min, then the temperature increased to 180 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, was maintained for 1 min, before finally the temperature reached 260 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min, prior to holding it for 15 min. EI-MS was carried out at 70 eV. The EO samples were diluted in acetone to prepare 1% solutions. Further identification was made by comparison of their MS with those stored in Wiley 275 and NIST 11, or with the literature.The crude EO (75 mL) of E. densa was chromatographed on a silica gel column (160–200 mesh, Qingdao Marina Chemical Plant, Qingdao, China) (column length 90 cm, diameter 5 cm), then eluted with a gradient of petroleum ether-ethyl acetate (from 100:0 to 0:100). Each 100 mL of eluate was collected as a fraction. With the monitoring of thin layer chromatography (TLC) profiles, similar fractions were combined and at last 10 fractions were obtained. Among them, the fractions (1–5) were pooled and further purified by silica gel column chromatography, and 11 compounds were isolated from them. The isolated compounds were elucidated with nuclear magnetic resonance. 1H and 13C NMR were performed on an NMR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, 400 MHz (Vnmr mercury-400 plus) and 600 MHz (Agilent DD2-600 MHz) for proton) at a temperature of 25 °C in the deuterated chloroform (CDCl3).According to the methods of Liu and Ho, the drip method and filter paper sheet method were used for the whole process of contact and fumigant activity, respectively. From the raised adults, 10 healthy adults with good activity and consistent growth were selected (regardless of gender). They were placed in an activity test glass bottle (5.5 cm high, 2.5 cm in diameter). The EO and isolated compounds were dissolved in acetone to prepare a serial testing solution, with acetone solvent as the negative control. According to the results of preliminary experiments, five concentrations of the EO and its isolated compounds were determined in formal experiments. Each treatment and control of different concentrations was replicated five times. The death/survival of the test insects were observed and recorded 24 h later, and abnormal activity of the insects was regarded as death.Repellant activity was assessed according to the method reported previously. The EO, its isolated compounds, and commercial compounds were dissolved in acetone to prepare a serial testing solution (78.63, 15.73, 3.15, 0.63, 0.13 nL/cm2). Acetone and DEET were used negative and positive controls, respectively. All of the experiments were carried out on Petri dishes (9 cm in diameter). A filter paper disk (9 cm in diameter) was cut into two halves. One half was uniformly treated with 500 μL of a testing solution, and the other half was treated with 500 μL of acetone. There were 20 insects in each Petri dish center. The number of insects that stayed on the treated (Nt) and control (Nc) halves were recorded after 2 and 4 h. Every treatment was repeated five times. Then, the percentage repellency (PR) of the EO and each compound was calculated using the formula: where Nc is the number of insects present in the negative control half, and Nt is the number of insects present in the treated half. At the same time, the average repellent rate was graded by reference, as shown in the table below. PR values were transferred into arcsin square root values, and subjected to One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) under Tukey’s HSD test at p < 0.05 (SPSS V 22.0, IBM, New York, NY, USA) (Table 1).In the bioassay of fumigant and contact, the effects of the EO and compounds were expressed by LC50 and LD50 values. Probit analysis was used for the calculation of these values. LC50, LD50, and PR values were transferred into arcsin square root values, and subjected to One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) under Tukey’s HSD test at p < 0.05 (SPSS V 19.0, IBM, NY, USA).Eight commercial compounds (furfural, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, geraniol, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanol, 2-ethyl-1H-imidazole and 2,4-ditert-butylphenol) were purchased from Saen Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China, The purity values were 99, 99.5, 98, 97, 98, 98, 99 and 98%, respectively.","The results showed that the yield of EO of E. densa was high at 0.34%, and the relative density of the EO of E. densa was 0.88 g/mL (Table 2). In the extraction process of water distillation of the EO, the first extracted oil is a light white light oil. With the extension of the extraction time, a light yellow oil was extracted immediately after the extraction, and was inter-dissolved with the light white translucent light oil. When the extraction time was 5–6 h, the extracted EO was a dark green light oil, and the rate of oil production was obviously reduced, but it was also inter-dissolved with the EO obtained from the previous extraction, and the overall appearance was a dark yellow and opaque oil-like liquid.The chemical composition of the EO is listed in Table 3. The results show that the EO of E. densa mainly contained terpenes and aromatic compounds, and among the terpene components, mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were identified. A total of 42 compounds were identified, accounting for 90.25% of the total EO. Limonene (22.05%), 2-Methyl-3-methylene-1-cyclopentanecarboxylic acid methyl ester (20.00%), 7-Methyl-3-methylidene-4-(propan-2-yl)octahydro-1H-cyclopenta[1,3]cyc-lopropa[1,2]benzene (11.17%), and ρ-cymen-7-ol (7.50%) were the major components. A total of 26 compounds were identified in the EO of E. densa by Liu et al., among which the higher contents were α-bisabolol (14.97%), elemene (9.04%), β-selinene (8.97%), (+)-γ-curjunene (6.37%), 3-methylenecyclopentanol (6.03%), α-guaiene (5.92%), and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-1,4-dimethyl-7-(1-methylethyl)-tenebrand hydrocarbon (5.92%). The main components were different from those found in the present study. The reason for the differences maybe that the aerial parts of E. densa were used in our study, and other studies collected samples from different places (the differences may be related to the sampling environment and location) ρ-Cymen-7-ol.From the EO of the aerial part of E. densa, 11 compounds (1–11) were isolated and identified. Among them, three compounds (7, 9 and 11) were isolated from the EO of E. densa at first. Terpenoids were isolated as the main components of the EO of E. densa. Terpenoids are generally used as flavors in the food industry, and as fragrances in the cosmetics industry.Eleven compounds were matched with the corresponding data (1H and 13C NMR data) in the literature, and their structures are listed in Figure 1.Limonene (1): colorless oil, C10H16. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δH (ppm): 1.97 (2H, tdd, J = 9.0, 3.7, 1.8 Hz, H-2), 1.61 (2H, ddt, J = 11.5, 9.8, 1.9 Hz, H-3), 1.44 (1H, dt, J = 8.8, 1.6 Hz, H-4), 1.18 (6H, t, J = 1.1 Hz, H-7, 10), 1.00 (2H, d, J = 1.6 Hz, H-5); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz) δC (ppm): 150.28 (C-8), 133.79 (C-1), 120.82 (C-6), 108.48 (C-9), 41.14 (C-4), 30.97 (C-2), 30.75 (C-5), 28.07 (C-3), 23.57 (C-7), 20.91 (C-10).

The 1H and 13C NMR data were in agreement with the reported data.The contact activities of E. densa against T. castaneum and L. serricorne is listed in Table 4. The EO of E. densa showed obvious contact activity against T. castaneum and L. serricorne, with LD50 values of 29.20 and 24.29 μg/adult, respectively. When compared with positive control pyrethrins, the EO demonstrated weak contact activity against T. castaneum and L. serricorne. However, compared with other EOs described in the literature, with which similar bioassays were used, the EO of E. densa possessed stronger contact activity against T. castaneum and L. serricorne. This included in comparison to the EOs of Ajania fruticulosa, Evodia lepta and Citrus wilsonii, which exhibited contact activity against T.castaneum at LD50 values of 105.67, 166.94 and 48.49 μg/adult, respectively. Meanwhile, the EO of Zingiber zerumbet showed contact activity against L. serricorne, with an LD50 value of 48.3 μg/adult.For T. castaneum, only 2-ethylimidazole possessed no contact activity (LD50 > 300 μg/adult), even at the highest testing concentration (50%, v/v), while the other 16 compounds showed different levels of contact activity. Among them, ρ-cymen-7-ol, 1-octen-3-ol and 3-octanol showed significant contact activity against T. castaneum, with LD50 values of 13.30, 13.52 and 17.45 μg/adult, respectively. Phytol, disobutyl phthalate, and dioctyl phthalate exhibited weak contact activity, with LD50 values of more than 100 μg/adult. For L. serricorne, 17 testing compounds exhibited strong contact activity at all the assayed concentrations. Most notably, ρ-cymen-7-ol, acetophenone, geraniol, 1-octen-3-ol, and 3-octanol showed very significant contact activities against L. serricorne, with LD50 values of 8.42, 7.07, 3.14, 3.39 and 7.75 μg/adult, respectively.Based on the above experimental results, we found that the contact activity of the EO was significantly weaker than that of the some compounds against T. castaneum and L. serricorne, suggesting that complex mixtures of active ingredients might also be beneficial in terms of pest resistance and behavioral desensitization. The different compounds showed different levels of contact activity against T. castaneum and L. serricorne, which may be due to the different sensitivity of different insects to the substances. As the temperature rises, the contact activity may become less effective.The fumigant activity of E. densa EO and its components against T. castaneum and L. serricorne is described in Table 5. The EO of E. densa showed significant fumigant activity against T. castaneum and L. serricorne, with LC50 values of 18.45 and 14.49 mg/L air, respectively. The results showed that T. castaneum was more tolerant than L. serricorne. When compared with the famous botanical insecticide, MeBr and Phosphine, the EO demonstrated weak fumigant activity against T. castaneum and L. serriocorne. However, compared with other EOs tested using a similar bioassay in the literature, the EO of E. densa in the present study exhibited stronger fumigant activity against T. castaneum and L. serricorne, e.g., EOs of Amomum maximum and Litsea cubeba exhibited fumigant activity against T. castaneum at LC50 values of 23.09 and 22.97 mg/L air, respectively. The EOs of Alpinia kwangsiensis and Amomum tsaoko showed fumigant activity against L. serricorne at LC50 values of 9.91 and 8.70 mg/L air, respectively. The results demonstrated that T. castaneum is more tolerant than L. serricorne.In the fumigant activity testing against T. castaneum, nine compounds (β-caryophyllene, phytol, α-terpineol, 1,8-cineole, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, geraniol, 2-ethyl-1H-imidazole, and 2,4-ditert-butylphenol) did not show fumigant activity against T. castaneum at the highest tested concentration. Among the 17 compounds tested, all the tested compounds exhibited obvious activity against T. astaneun, except for nine compounds, including β-caryophyllene, which did not exhibit fumigant activity against T. castaneum at the highest tested concentration (50%). ρ-cymene (LC50 = 10.91 mg/L air) and ρ-cymen-7-ol (LC50 = 10.47 mg/L air) exhibited stronger and closer fumigant toxicity against T. castaneum. In addition, 1-octen-3-ol and 3-octanol also exhibited relatively similar fumigant toxicity against T. castaneum, with LC50 values of 19.17 and 19.85 mg/L air, respectively.In the fumigant activity test experiment against L. serricorne, five compounds (phytol, ρ-cymen-7-ol, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, and geraniol) did not lead to death of the tested L. serricorne at the highest tested concentration (50%); they did not exhibit fumigant toxicity against L. serricorne. Other compounds exhibited obvious fumigant toxicity against L. serricorne. Among them, limonene (LC50 = 5.86 mg/L air), acetophenone (LC50 = 5.47 mg/L air), and 3-octanol (LC50 = 5.05 mg/L air) showed stronger fumigant toxicity against L. serricorne, with LC50 values of less than 6.00 mg/L air. In general, the fumigant activity of ρ-cymen-7-ol and α-terpineol exhibited significant fumigant activity against L. serricorne, but no fumigant activity against L. serricorne at the highest tested concentration (50%) was found with ρ-cymen-7-ol. Only limonene, ρ-cymene, linalool, acetophenone, furfural, 1-octen-3-ol, and 3-octanol showed more stable fumigant activity against both target insects. In contrast, phytol, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, and geraniol did not show fumigant toxicity to both target insects. As previously found, temperature can significantly affect the efficiency of EOs. In the fumigant activity test experiment, as the temperature rises, the results may be better.The results of repellency assays for the EO and individual compounds selected against T. castaneum and L. serricorne are shown in Figure 2. The results showed that at the testing concentrations, the EO and compounds exhibited different levels of repellent activity against T. castaneum and L. serricorne. Total repellent activity against T. castaneum was greater than that for L. serricorne. Acetophenone, ρ-cymen-7-ol, α-terpineol, and the EO showed strong repellent activities against T. castaneum at all testing concentrations, according to most data distributions in Figure 2. It was noteworthy that only linalool possessed weak repellent activity against T. castaneum, while the EO and seven compounds showed significant repellent activity at 78.63 and 15.73 nL/cm2 at 2 h after exposure, and had PR values of almost 100%. At the testing concentration range of 3.15–0.13 nL/cm2, EO, limonene, α-terpineol, acetophenone, and ρ-cymen-7-ol possessed significant repellency against T. castaneum, with PR values of 80–90% at 2 h post-exposure. β-Caryophyllene, ρ-cymene, phytol, and linalool exhibited mild repellent activity with the testing concentration range of 3.15–0.13 nL/cm2 at 2 h after exposure. 1,8-Cineole displayed significant repellent activity at all testing concentrations, with PR values of 100, 94, 74, 64 and 48%, respectively, at 2 h after exposure, and the activity increased with the concentration of exposure. Although seven compounds showed repellent activity against T. castaneum that was greater than that of EO, phytol, and linalool at the highest testing concentration at 4 h after exposure, these substances had PR values of 98, 88 and 86%. The PR values of β-caryophyllene, acetophenone, and ρ-cymen-7-ol showed significant repellent activity of almost 100% at a testing concentration of 15.73 nL/cm2 against T. castaneum at 4 h after exposure, while the PR values of β-caryophyllene, acetophenone, and ρ-cymen-7-ol were the same as the positive control DEET at 15.73 nL/cm2 against T. castaneum at 4 h after exposure. The results indicated the EO and compounds possessed approximately equal repellent activity with DEET against T. castaneum at the testing concentrations of 78.63 and 15.73 nL/cm2 at 2 and 4 h post-exposure. Unfortunately, ρ-cymene showed weak repellent activity against T. castaneum with the testing concentration range of 3.15–0.13 nL/cm2 at 4 h after exposure, while other compounds exhibited strong repellent activity; it had PR values of 40–80%.For L. serricorne, β-caryophyllene, 1,8-cineole and ρ-cymene exhibited significant repellent activity when applied at all testing concentrations, and had PR values ranging from 50–100%, at the same level as DEET. The EO, acetophenone and ρ-cymen-7-ol showed obvious repellency only at the testing concentrations of 78.63 and 15.73 nL/cm2. At 4 h after exposure, β-caryophyllene, ρ-cymene, and ρ-cymen-7-ol were better than the EO and other compounds at 78.63 and 15.73 nL/cm2, according to PR values. α-Terpineol and phytol exhibited moderate repellency against L. serricorne at 4 h after exposure. Limonene and linalool exhibited weak repellent activity against L. serricorne at all testing concentrations at 4 h after exposure. Most notably, at the lowest testing concentration, ρ-cymen exhibited strong repellent activity (60 and 48%, respectively) against L. serricorne at 4 h after exposure. In general, the variety of the repellent activity was easily affected by the sensitivity of the insects, the testing concentration, and the exposure duration. The repellent effect is complicated to interpret, and thus further work is needed to clarify it.The results of the repellent assays showed that the EO and nine individual compounds exhibited different levels of repellent activity against T. castaneum at the highest testing concentration when exposed for 2 h. The PR values of the EO, limonene, β-caryophyllene, ρ-cymen, α-terpineol, 1,8-cineole, acetophenone, and ρ-cymen-7-ol were all almost 100%, and no statistically significant differences occurred between them. Although limonene accounted for 22% of the total EO, it exhibited weaker repellent activity than the EO against T. castaneum at all testing concentrations, while the EO was still highly repellent against T. castaneum. In this situation, the repellent activity of the EO did not seem to be greatly affected by limonene, and it is speculated that secondary components of the EOs may play an important role in the repellent activity, and have a synergistic effect that enhances the active effect. Another speculation is that some relatively inactive compounds play an important role in the multicomponent mixture. Some compounds are not significantly active on their own, but can enhance the active effects of other compounds. The repellent activity of the main components in EOs does not completely determine the overall effect of EOs, but synergistic and antagonistic interactions between the various components may have an important effect on the overall activity. Trongtokit et al. reported that interactions between two or more components are caused by different ratios. The appropriate combination of compounds can increase the synergistic effect considerably. Compound proportioning is a complex and interesting issue that deserves further investigation.",,"In this work, the EO extracted from E. densa and its chemical compounds exhibited effective insecticidal toxicity and repellency against T. castaneum and L. serricorne. Compared with synthetic chemical insecticides, plant-derived materials have many advantages in pest management. They are scalable, safe for human health, and environmentally friendly. E. densa is used in traditional Chinese medicine, and has a long history. The characteristics highlighted above increase the feasibility of developing spice plants from the Elsholtzia family into eco-friendly pesticides, and suggest that the EO of Elsholtzia may have promise as a bioinsecticide or green repellent for pest management in warehouses and grain stores. However, further work should be devoted to investigating the mutual interactions among individual compounds, including their mechanism of action and possible relationships between toxicity and repellency. Meanwhile, further work should also be devoted to the effect of temperature on insecticidal and repellant activity. Whether the EO is actually safe for humans and the environment in the long term requires further experiments to verify. In addition, the target of action against insects should be confirmed."
83,TA049516,10.3390/md15040116,Cloning and Functional Characterization of a Lycopene β-Cyclase from MacrophyticRed Alga Bangia fuscopurpurea.,"Lycopene cyclases cyclize the open ends of acyclic lycopene (ψ,ψ-carotene) intoβ- or ε-ionone rings in the crucial bifurcation step of carotenoid biosynthesis.Among all carotenoid constituents, β-carotene (β,β-carotene) is found in allphotosynthetic organisms, except for purple bacteria and heliobacteria,suggesting a ubiquitous distribution of lycopene β-cyclase activity in theseorganisms. In this work, we isolated a gene (BfLCYB) encoding a lycopeneβ-cyclase from Bangia fuscopurpurea, a red alga that is considered to be one ofthe primitive multicellular eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms and accumulatescarotenoid constituents with both β- and ε-rings, including β-carotene,zeaxanthin, α-carotene (β,ε-carotene) and lutein. Functional complementation inEscherichia coli demonstrated that BfLCYB is able to catalyze cyclization oflycopene into monocyclic γ-carotene (β,ψ-carotene) and bicyclic β-carotene, andcyclization of the open end of monocyclic δ-carotene (ε,ψ-carotene) to produceα-carotene. No ε-cyclization activity was identified for BfLCYB. Sequencecomparison showed that BfLCYB shares conserved domains with other functionallycharacterized lycopene cyclases from different organisms and belongs to a groupof ancient lycopene cyclases. Although B. fuscopurpurea also synthesizesα-carotene and lutein, its enzyme-catalyzing ε-cyclization is still unknown.","Cao, Tian-Jun, Huang, Xing-Qi, Qu, Yuan-Yuan, Zhuang, Zhong, Deng, Yin-Yin, Lu, Shan",2017,Marine drugs,2,False,False,True,"Carotenoids are one of the largest groups of natural pigments in land plants, algae, bacteria including cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria, archaea, fungi and animals. More than 750 carotenoids, not including their cis- and trans- isomers as distinct compounds, have been isolated and characterized from natural sources. Carotenoids not only serve as essential pigments for photosynthesis and photoprotection in photosynthetic organisms, but also comprise many of the yellow, orange and red colors in flowers and fruits that attract pollinators and seed dispersers in higher plants. Abscisic acid and strigolactones are also derivatives of carotenoids.Higher plants generally have very similar leaf carotenoid profiles, with lutein, β-carotene (β,β-carotene), violaxanthin and neoxanthin being the major components. They may also accumulate specific carotenoids, such as capsanthin in pepper fruits, β-carotene in carrot tubers and astaxanthin in Adonis aestivalis flowers. In the past 20 years, most of the metabolic reactions in the biosynthesis of carotenoids have been deciphered, thanks to the cloning and characterization of genes encoding metabolic enzymes from different organisms. In plants, the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway utilizes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate to synthesize the 5-carbon (C5) isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). A geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP, C20) synthase (CrtE) catalyzes the condensation of these two substrates to produce GGPP as a precursor for the biosynthesis of carotenoids and other diterpenoids. Phytoene synthase (CrtB) utilizes two molecules of GGPP to produce phytoene and thus directs the metabolic flux from GGPP into carotenoid metabolic pathway. Phytoene is then converted to acyclic lycopene (ψ,ψ-carotene) by the combination of desaturases CrtP and CrtQ in eukaryotes, but only CrtI in prokaryotes.Cyclization of lycopene by lycopene cyclases (LCY) is a crucial bifurcation step in the carotenogenic pathway (Figure 1). Each open end of lycopene can be cyclized by lycopene β-cyclase (LCYB) or ε-cyclase (LCYE) to produce β- or ε-ionone rings, respectively (Figure 1). The formation of two β-ionone rings results in the production of β-carotene and its derivatives (e.g., zeaxanthin and neoxanthin), whereas the combination of β- and ε-ionone rings forms α-carotene (β,ε-carotene) and its derivate lutein (Figure 1). Carotenoids with two ε-ionone rings are uncommon in most plants, with lactucaxanthin in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) being one of the exceptions. Carotenes with at least one unsubstituted β-ionone ring can be utilized by the human body to produce vitamin A. Therefore, an increase in the activity of LCYB can direct the metabolic flux from lycopene to the production of this group of so-called provitamin A carotenes to increase the nutritional value of crops.Cumulative studies on carotenoids in red algae have uncovered broad compositional diversity. Red algae can also be divided into three groups according to their specific carotenoid compositions. Although carotenoid constituents with an ε-ionone ring are missing in some primitive species, β-carotene is found in all red algae, suggesting a ubiquitous distribution of the β-cyclization activity in carotenoid biosynthesis. LCYB of Cyanidioschyzon merolae is also the only LCY gene from the entire red alga phylum that has been characterized.The red algal genus Bangia Lyngb., although probably not monophyletic, is among the earliest multicellular eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. Carotenoids with both β- and ε-rings, including β-carotene, zeaxanthin, α-carotene and lutein, are accumulated in Bangia. In this work, we isolated a gene encoding an LCY from Bangia fuscopurpurea, and functional characterization revealed that this enzyme has only β-cyclization activity.","Thalli of Bangia fuscopurpurea (#Bangia-MC1F, Jiangsu Institute of Oceanology and Marine Fisheries, Nantong, Jiangsu, China) were initially collected from cultivated populations in Putian, Fujian Province, China (24°59′ N, 118°48′ E) and then subcultured in sterilized seawater in our laboratory. Ambient air filtered through a 0.45 μm filter was gently supplied to the culture. The growth conditions were 16 °C with a 12 h/12 h light/dark regime under 80 μmol m−2 s−1 irradiance. Seawater was changed every week.Sequences of functionally characterized LCYs from Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Ipomoea batatas, Adonis aestivalis, Marchantia polymorpha, Chromochloris zofingiensis, Dunaliella salina, Ostreococcus lucimarinus and Cyanidioschyzon merolae were downloaded from GenBank, and their homologs in Ectocarpus siliculosus, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Chondrus crispus and Galdieria sulphuraria were searched in GenBank using the blastP algorithm with the sequences of known LCYs as queries. Sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW in MEGA 6. A bootstrap (1000 replicates) neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was also generated using MEGA 6. 4.3. Molecular manipulation.Total RNA was isolated from Bangia fuscopurpurea material as previously described and treated with DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to eliminate any genomic DNA contamination. For rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), the SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) was used to synthesize a full-length cDNA pool.According to the alignment of the functionally characterized LCYs, two pairs of degenerate primers (DF1/DR1, DF2/DR2, sequences of all primers used in this work are listed in Table 1) were designed from the conserved regions, and used for amplifying a corresponding fragment from the B. fuscopurpurea cDNA pool. After two rounds of nested PCR, amplified products were subcloned and sequenced by GenScript (Nanjing, China). The sequences of the cloned fragments were queried against GenBank using the tblastX algorithm to analyze their similarities to known or predicted LCY genes.Using the sequences that had high similarity to known LCYs, three pairs of primers (RF1/RR1, RF2/RR2 and RF3/RR3) were designed for 5′- and 3′-RACEs, respectively, using the SMARTer RACE kit. After three rounds of nested PCR, two overlapping fragments were amplified from the cDNA pool, subcloned and sequenced. The sequences were assembled into a putative cDNA sequence that contained both translation initiation and stop codons. We then designed an additional pair of primers (HF and ER) from the assembled sequence to amplify the full-length ORF from the cDNA pool for confirming the existence of this transcript (named BfLCYB).To study the genomic sequence of BfLCYB, genomic DNA was extracted according to Yang et al.. Primers HF and ER were used to amplify its coding region. A Genome Walking Kit (TaKaRa) was used to amplify the 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences. All amplicons were purified, subcloned, sequenced and assembled. Two primers (gHF and gER) were used to amplify from the genomic DNA for confirming the assembled genomic DNA sequence of BfLCYB.Prediction of the subcellular localization of BfLCYB was performed using TargetP, YLoc and ChloroP.For studying the subcellular localization of BfLCYB, protoplasts isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll were transiently transformed. The full-length ORF of BfLCYB was amplified with primers HF-SpeI and ER-SpeI to incorporate restriction sites. The amplicon was purified, digested with SpeI, and subcloned into pA7-YFP (kindly provided by Dr. Hongquan Yang). The transformed protoplasts were cultured in 24-well plates at room temperature for 16 h in the dark. Fluorescence signal from the BfLCYB-YFP fusion protein was observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus FluoView FV1000, Tokyo, Japan). The transient expression experiments were repeated independently at least three times.To assess the catalytic activity of BfLCYB, we used the pigment complementation system. Two vectors, pAC-LCY and pAC-EPSILON were provided by Dr. Cunningham. The full-length ORF of BfLCYB was amplified with primers HF-BamHI and ER-BamHI to incorporate restriction sites. The amplified product was subcloned into pMAL-C5X (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) to produce pMAL-BfLCYB. pMAL-BfLCYB was co-transformed with pAC-LCY, or pAC-ΕPSILON, into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). After overnight growth at 37 °C on Luria-Bertani (LB), plants containing 34 μg mL−1 chloramphenicol and 100 μg mL−1 ampicillin, positive co-transformed single colonies were picked and used to inoculate 8 mL LB medium containing the same antibiotics. One mL of the overnight culture was transferred to 100 mL of the same medium and grown at 37 °C until reaching an OD600 of 0.30. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 50 μmol L−1. After growing for 16 h at 18 °C, bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 80% (v/v) acetone to extract the pigments.Separation of carotenoid components was performed by reverse-phase HPLC. A Waters 2695 separation module and 2998 photodiode array detector (PDA) were used with a Spherisorb ODS2 column (5 μm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). A 45 min gradient of ethyl acetate (0% to 100%) in acetonitrile-water-triethylamine (9:1:0.01, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1 was used, and the absorbance of the eluent at 440 nm was monitored. The identity of the carotenoid in each peak was further confirmed by their UV/visible spectra recorded by the PDA detector.","From the alignment of functionally characterized LCYs from different organisms, we designed two pairs of degenerate primers. Nested PCR using these primers resulted in amplicons of different sizes. After cloning and sequencing these fragments, a 262 base pair (bp) fragment was found to have high similarity to known LCYs (data not shown). Based on the sequence of this fragment, we successfully amplified a 2218 bp genomic DNA fragment and a 1932 bp complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding a putative protein with 643 amino acid residues, designated BfLCYB in this work (Figure 2A). Sequence alignment demonstrated that BfLCYB does not possess any introns. BfLCYB shares 38% sequence identity with the characterized LCYB from C. merolae. The sequence of BfLCYB has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number KX943552.Five conserved domains, including an NAD(P)/FAD-binding domain, were previously reported for functionally characterized LCYs. These domains were also identified in BfLCYB (Figure 2). However, the NAD(P)/FAD-binding domain in BfLCYB is interrupted by an apparent insertion of 12 additional amino acid residues (Figure 2B). Cunningham and Gantt also identified a six-amino-acid region in LCYE that contributes to the determination of ring numbers in lycopene ε-cyclization products. We found that this region is located immediately downstream from the fifth conserved domain in LCYs (Figure 2F,G). However, in BfLCYB, this region has much lower similarity to other LCYs than either its upstream or downstream flanking regions (Figure 2G).From online analysis using TargetP, ChloroP and YLoc, BfLCYB was predicted to have a chloroplast localization. Its N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide predicted by TargetP and ChloroP is in square brackets in Figure 2A. To experimentally confirm its localization, the open reading frame (ORF) of BfLCYB was fused in frame to the 5′-end of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in pA7-YFP. Due to the lack of a method to stably transform Bangia, we transiently expressed the BfLCYB-YFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis thaliana leaf protoplasts. The YFP signal of the fusion protein was solely found in chloroplasts and merged nicely with chlorophyll autofluorescence, thus confirming its predicted chloroplast localization (Figure 3).To determine the enzymatic activity of BfLCYB, we used a bacterial pigment complementation system. The plasmid pAC-LCY contains the genes from Pantoea for geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (CrtE), phytoene synthase (CrtB) and phytoene desaturase (CrtI). Escherichia coli transformed with pAC-LCY can utilize endogenous IPP and DMAPP to produce lycopene, which turns the cells pink (Figure 4A). When we co-transformed E. coli with both pMAL-BfLCYB and pAC-LCY, the positive transformants harboring both plasmids had an orange color (Figure 4B). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed an accumulation of both the monocyclic γ-carotene (β,ψ-carotene) and the bicyclic β-carotene in these orange cells (Figure 4B). We did not find accumulation of either ε-carotene (ε,ε-carotene) or δ-carotene (ε,ψ-carotene) in the co-transformed bacteria. These results suggested that BfLCYB is able to cyclize one or both ends of lycopene into β-ionone rings but not ε-ionone rings.We further confirmed the function of BfLCYB by co-transforming pMAL-BfLCYB with pAC-EPSILON. In addition to the genes carried by pAC-LCY, pAC-EPSILON carries the gene from lettuce for LCYE, which catalyzes the ε-cyclization at both ends of lycopene. E. coli cells transformed with pAC-EPSILON accumulated ε-carotene, as expected (Figure 4C). When this plasmid was co-transformed with pMAL-BfLCYB, HPLC analysis revealed the accumulation of both α-carotene and β-carotene, together with a significantly reduced level of ε-carotene and a small amount of γ-carotene (Figure 4D). This demonstrated that BfLCYB can also β-cyclize the open end of monocyclic δ-carotene.Using sequences of functionally characterized LCYs, we identified LCY homologs in heterokonts and red algae of which full genomes have been sequenced. For heterokonts, in the genome of either Ectocarpus siliculosus (brown alga) or Phaeodactylum tricornutum (diatom), there is only a single gene encoding an LCY homolog (Figure 5A). However, for the multicellular red alga Chondrus crispus, our search identified two genes for putative LCYs in its genome (Figure 5A). Our phylogenetic analysis divided LCYs and their homologs into five major clades. Clade I comprises members from single-cell red algae, including the LCYB from Cyanidioschyzon merolae and a homolog from Galdieria sulphuraria. Clade II has members from multicellular red algae, including BfLCYB in this study and the two homologs from Chondrus crispus. Clade IV has LCY homologs from heterokonts. The other two clades, III and V, are LCYBs and LCYEs, respectively, from the green lineage (green algae and land plants) (Figure 5A).A recently study by Blatt et al. reported a gene (OluLCY) encoding a lycopene β-cyclase/lycopene ε-cyclase/light-harvesting complex-fusion protein from the green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus. Our sequence analysis of this gene identified two coding regions (OluLCY-B and OluLCY-E) that are tandemly arranged, separated by a short intron (Figure 5B). In our phylogenetic tree, peptides encoded by these two regions are grouped with functionally characterized LCYBs and LCYEs, respectively (Figure 5B).","In green lineage organisms (green algae and land plants), carotenoids with both β- and ε-rings are found, and separate LCYBs and LCYEs catalyzing the corresponding cyclization steps are also characterized from different species. Our phylogenetic analysis clustered LCYBs and LCYEs from these organisms into separate clades (IV and V, Figure 5), showing a divergence of lycopene β- and ε-cyclase activities (Clades IV and V, Figure 5A) before the origination of the green lineage. This is also supported by the identification of the OluLCY gene, which has two tandemly arranged regions for peptides with LCYB and LCYE activities, respectively, suggesting probable gene duplication and divergence.In red algae and heterokonts, although their carotenoid constituents have been studied, there is not sufficient information on their LCYs. In both single-cell red algae and heterokonts, only β-carotene and its derivatives were found. Consistently, LCYs from Cyanidioschyzon merolae possess only β-cyclization activity, and studies in diatoms found no sequences showing similarity to LCYE genes either. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that members of Clades I and IV in Figure 5A are all LCYBs.For multicellular red algae, which accumulates carotenoids with both β- and ε-rings, studies on their LCYs are lacking. In this work, we studied lycopene cyclization in Bangia fuscopurpurea, which is considered to be one of the simplest macrophytic red algae. Our molecular cloning and functional characterization results demonstrated that B. fuscopurpurea has a functional LCYB (BfLCYB), which is capable of catalyzing β-cyclization at both ends of the acyclic lycopene or at either end of the monocyclic γ-carotene or δ-carotene. By scanning the genome sequence of another multicellular red alga, Chondrus crispus, we found two homolog genes for LCYs. These remind us of the possible existence of another as-yet-unidentified LCYE homolog responsible for ε-cyclization in B. fuscopurpurea. Cloning and functional characterization of this second LCY from B. fuscopurpurea should help to decipher carotenoid metabolism and its evolution in red algae.",

Leaf Formulations After In Vitro Digestion.","The present work evaluates the effect of casein, glucose, and olive oil onphytochemical bioaccessibility, antioxidant potential (DPPH and FRAP),antidiabetic potential (inhibition of amylase, α-glucosidase, and BSA glycation),and antihyperlipidemic potential (inhibition of lipase) of gingko standardizedleaf extract in the form of tablets after in vitro digestion. Gingko extractformulations with protein, carbohydrates, and oil had high (>70%) in vitrobioaccessibility of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin after each phases ofdigestion in comparison to moderate (35-70%) in vitro bioaccessibility fromgingko water extract. Formulation with the highest in vitro bioaccessibility ofthe majority of the tested polyphenolic groups and terpene lactones after oraland intestinal phases was ginkgo with olive oil. High (>70%) antioxidant (DPPHand FRAP), antidiabetic (α-glucosidase and BSA glycation), and antihyperlipidemicpotential were detected in almost all ginkgo formulations. Based on the results,we conclude that the in vitro bioaccessibility of individual compounds or groupsof compounds depends on whether the tablets are taken with water or with foods(protein, carbohydrates, and oil).","Rusak, Gordana, Vujčić Bok, Valerija, Šola, Ivana, Nikša, Ema, Maleš, Željan",2024,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,True,True,True,"Ginkgo leaf extract is used as a dietary supplement. It is used in the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. The main positive effects of Ginkgo biloba L. leaves are increased blood circulation and tissue oxygenation, antagonistic action against platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptors, prevention of cell damage by free radicals, protection of mitochondrial function during cellular stress, increase in memory and cognitive function (especially in the elderly), protection of nerve tissue, assistance in adaptation to stressors, modulation of vascular risk, reduction in anxiety. According to Eisvand et al., ginkgo leaf extract has an impact on weight loss; antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and hypolipemic effects associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Good effects, on peripheral and cerebral blood flow, occur thanks to the chemical components of the extract, which inhibit platelet aggregation and increase the release of nitric oxide (NO) into the blood vessels. Therapeutic mechanisms of action are attributed to antioxidant properties and free radical scavenging properties. Thanks to its antioxidant properties, oxidative stress is also reduced, which is closely related to damage and the development of various diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases as well as the appearance of cancer. In the case of antioxidant deficiency, concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen reactive species are often increased, which then lead to lipid peroxidation. Antioxidants from G. biloba leaf extract react with reactive species and thus inhibit lipid peroxidation, so the cytoprotective activity of this plant extract is attributed to antioxidant activity and the ability to increase the activity of endogenous enzymes that remove free radicals such as superoxide dismutase and catalase.The typical daily dose is 120 to 240 mg of standardized ginkgo plant extract in a 50:1 ratio, with 24% flavonoid glycosides and about 6% terpenoids. Such an extract can be in liquid form or as part of a tablet. So far, some research has been conducted to increase the oral bioavailability of flavonoids, ginkgolide, and bilobalide from ginkgo. Tang et al. conducted a study on improving the oral bioavailability of active components from ginkgo since they are poorly soluble, resulting in lower bioavailability values. They conducted an in vivo study on a sample of six healthy dogs whose weight varied between 20 and 28 kg. They were given 800 mg tablets orally with and without the use of self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS). SEDDS consists of oil, surfactant, and cosurfactant that exist as an emulsion within an aqueous medium. They took blood and plasma samples from which LC-ESI-MS analysis detected concentrations of ginkgolide and bilobalide. More positive results were obtained for the combination of ginkgo and SEDDS, since the concentrations of bilobalide, as well as ginkgolide A and B were 162.1; 154.6%, and 155.8% higher than pure tablets. As a conclusion, they stated that the combination with SEDDS promotes a more successful dissolution of these phytochemicals, and thus their bioavailability. Since the bioavailability of flavonoids in the brain is very low due to the brain’s blood–brain barrier and due to their low solubility in the lipophilic medium that prevents them from passing through biological membranes, new approaches based on nanotechnology and proliposomes are being developed, which include the addition of substances such as oil, sugar, or protein to increase bioavailability. Phytochemicals’ bioavailability studies on animals and humans have limitation. They are expensive, time-consuming, and require special approvals for ethical reasons. So, in vitro digestive models represent a good alternative to test phytochemical release from the food matrix and give information about the in vitro bioaccessibility of phytochemicals and evaluate their profile change before absorption. Olivera et al. conducted a study that determined that the in vitro digestion model is a good method for studying antioxidant activity and providing insight into the in vitro bioaccessibility of phenolic substances from ginkgo leaf extract, as this model can easily and quickly simulate important physicochemical and biochemical conditions of the digestive tract. They also emphasize that the method does not include some aspects of the in vivo process, such as the activity of microorganisms along the digestive tract. Given their poor solubility and good permeability, triterpene and diterpene lactones have poor bioavailability. Wang et al. conducted a study in which they prepared tablets from ginkolide powder and soy phospholipids to improve the bioavailability of lactones. Soy phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule that binds to lactones and promotes their dissolution, and thus bioavailability in the in vivo system.The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro bioaccessibility of ginkgo bioactive substances and antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antihyperlipidemic potential after application of ginkgo extract in combination with protein, carbohydrates, and oil in order to determine the effect of individual nutrients on the in vitro bioaccessibility of ginkgo bioactive substances. This research could give us information on how different food matrices/meals/formulations influence the in vitro bioaccessibility of ginkgo phytochemicals. For this purpose, the effects of protein (casein with a concentration of 40 g/L), carbohydrates (glucose with a concentration of 25 g/L), and oil (5% olive oil) on the in vitro bioaccessibility of polyphenols and the antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antihyperlipidemic potential of G. biloba extract under in vitro digestion conditions were investigated.","The flavonoid and phenolic acid standards were of HPLC grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich GmbH (Taufkirchen, Germany) or Extra synthese (Genay, France). All other chemicals and reagents were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich GmbH (Taufkirchen, Germany) or Kemika (Zagreb, Croatia). The chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade.Standardized Ginkgo biloba L. leaf extract tablets (brand: M. E. V. Feller, Lot. No. 1789005, origin: United Kingdom) were purchased in a local pharmacy (Zagreb, Croatia). Two ginkgo tablets were grounded (80 mg of standardized ginkgo leaf extracts per tablet) and overflowed with 4 mL of deionized water, 40 mg/mL casein (Sigma Aldrich GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) water solution, 25 mg/mL glucose (Kemika, Zagreb, Croatia) water solution, and 5% olive oil (Zvijezda plus d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia) water solution and vortex for 15 s. Immediately after the preparation of ginkgo water, ginkgo casein (40 mg/mL), ginkgo glucose (25 mg/mL), and ginkgo olive oil (5%) formulations, in vitro digestion of the samples was performed.The in vitro digestion model was performed according to Rusak et al.. First, the volume of 0.3 mL of ginkgo water, casein (40 mg/mL), glucose (25 mg/mL), and olive oil (5%) formulations was mixed with the same volume of 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0. The salivary phase of digestion was initialized with 10 μL of amylase (0.48 mg/mL in 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0) and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath at 150 rpm. To simulate the stomach digestion, 0,4 mL of porcine pepsin solution (3 mg/mL in 0.1 M HCl) was added and acidified with 0.5 M HCl (pH 2.0). The samples were incubated in a shaking water bath SW22 (Julabo, Seelbach, Germany) for 1 h at 37 °C at 150 rpm. The upper intestinal phase of digestion was first mimicked by adding sodium bicarbonate (1 M NaHCO3) to adjust the pH to 5.3. After pH adjustment, volume of 0.9 mL of pancreatic juices (2.4 mg bile acids/mL, 0.2 mg porcine lipase/mL, and 0.4 mg pancreatin/mL in 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0) was added. The final total volume of each intestinal phase sample was brought to 2 mL with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The final pH was also adjusted to 7.0 with 1 M NaOH. The samples were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath at 150 rpm. The final volume of each sample, both before and after digestion, was brought to 2 mL with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The samples were centrifuged (Hettich MIKRO 220R; Andreas Hettich GmbH & Co., Tuttlingen, Germany) at 11,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were stored at −20 °C until spectrophotometric and HPLC analyses. The in vitro digestion was carried out in triplicates. Each digestion stage contained samples with ginkgo leaf extract, samples with extract and glucose, samples with extract and casein, samples with extract, and olive oil and blanks. Blanks were distilled water samples, water glucose samples, water casein samples, and water olive oil samples. All these samples (before digestion and after salivary, gastric, and intestinal phases of in vitro digestion) were used for the spectrophotometric and HPLC analyses.The total polyphenols (TP) of all formulations were determined with Folin–Ciocalteau reagent according to Zhishen et al.. A volume of 2 μL of the ginkgo test solution was diluted with 158 μL of deionized water and then 10 μL of Foline–Ciocalteau reagent was added. Subsequently, 30 μL Na2CO3 (1.88 M) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 45 °C. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 740 nm. The TP content was calculated from the calibration curve and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (mg GAE/g).The content of total flavonoids (TF) of all formulations was determined with AlCl3 according to the method described by Zhishen et al.. To dilute ginkgo solution (20 μL in 80 μL of dH2O) volume of 6 μL NaNO2 (5%) was added. After 5 min of incubation, volume of 6 μL AlCl3 (10%) was added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for an additional 6 min. Subsequently, 40 μL NaOH (1 M) and distilled water were added to the final volume of 200 μL. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was read at 520 nm. The TF content was calculated from the calibration curve and expressed as quercetin equivalents (mg QE/g).The content of phenolic acids (TPA) in all formulations was determined according to European Pharmacopoeia. A volume of 40 μL of ginkgo solution was mixed with 80 μL HCl (0.5 M). In the solution, 80 μL of freshly prepared reagent (1 g NaNO2 i 1,17 g Na2MoO4 × 2H2O in 10 mL of deionized water) was added. Subsequently, 80 μL NaOH 8.5% (w/w) and distilled water were added to the final volume of 400 μL. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was read at 492 nm. The TPA content was calculated from the calibration curve and expressed as caffeic acid equivalents (mg CAE/g).The total content of hydroxycinnamic acids (THA) and total flavonols (TFLO) of the gingko samples were measured according to the method of Howard et al. using caffeic acid and quercetin as standards. A volume of 50 μL of the extract (3 g/L) was mixed with 50 μL HCl (1 g/L in ethanol) and 0.91 mL of HCl (2 g/L). The absorbance of the solution was read at 320 and 360 nm, respectively. The THA and TFL contents were calculated from the corresponding calibration curves and expressed as caffeic acid (mg CAE/g) and quercetin equivalents (mg QAE/g), respectively.The total flavanol (TFLA) content was determined using p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMACA) according to Kusznierewicz et al.. A volume of 100 μL of the ginkgo tested solution was mixed with 150 μL of DMACA solution (0.1% in 1 M HCl in MeOH). After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance at 595 nm was measured. The TFL content was calculated from the calibration curve and expressed as catechin equivalents (mg CE/g).The total proanthocyanidin (TPA) content was measured according to the vanillin-HCl assay described by Sun et al.. The solution of vanillin (4% in methanol) was mixed with 25 μL of the ginkgo samples and 75 μL of HCl (conc.). After 15 min of incubation, the absorbance of reaction mixture was read at 492 nm. TPA content was calculated from the calibration curve and expressed as catechin equivalents (mg CE/g).The determination of terpene trilactones (TTL) was determined according to Su et al. at a wavelength of 520 nm. A volume of 40 µL of diluted gingko sample in 96% ethanol (1:9), and 16 µL of hydroxylamine solution containing 13.9% solution of hydroxylammonium chloride and sodium hydroxide (3.5 M) was added in a volume ratio of 1:2. The solution was then incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. After incubation, 16 µL HCl solution (3 M), 8 µL FeCl3 solution (6%), and 200 µL ethanol (70%) were added. The TTL content was calculated from the calibration curve and expressed as ginkgolides A and B equivalents (mg GIN-AE/g, mg GIN-BE/g).Before HPLC analysis, ginkgo samples were purified from protein according to Kendrick Labs Inc. protocol in 96% ethanol (1:9), incubated for 2 h at −80 °C, and centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. The purified ginkgo supernatants were then hydrolyzed with 1.2 M HCl as described in Šola et al.. The solutions were centrifuged three times (13,000 rpm, 5 min) and the supernatants stored at −20 °C until analysis.Qualitative and quantitative RP-HPLC analysis was performed using the Agilent 1100 Series system equipped with a quaternary pump, multiwave UV/Vis detector, autosampler, fraction collector, Zorbax SB C-18 analytical guard column (12.5 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle size), and Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (100 × 4.6 mm, 4 µm particle size) (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Mobile phase A was 0.2% acetic acid and mobile phase B was 0.2% acetic acid and 80% methanol and the solvent gradient profile as in Šola et al.. The flow rate was 1 mL/min and the injected volume of the sample was 20 μL. For quantification, the multiwave UV/vis detector was set at 360 nm for the determination of quercetin, kempferol, and isorhamnetin. Quercetin (Q), kaempferol (K), and isorhamnetin (IsoR) were characterized according to their retention times and UV spectra compared to commercial standards. For quantitative analyses, calibration curves were obtained by injection of 5 known concentrations (in the range of 1–250 µg/mL) of the 96% EtOH standard mixed solution in triplicate. The injection volume was 5 µL. Phenolics quantification was made by integration of peak areas with reference to calibration curves made using known amounts of available pure standard compounds. The results are expressed as mg/L. The obtained chromatograms are shown in the Figure S1.The free radical scavenging activity was measured using a stable free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) following the method of Radić Brkanac et al.. Briefly, 10 μL of tested ginkgo solution was added to 190 μL of freshly prepared ethanolic DPPH solution (0.1 mM) and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. The decrease in absorbance was measured at 520 nm. The radical scavenging activity was calculated from the equation: % inhibition = [(A0 − At)/A0] × 100, where A0 was the absorbance of the control (blank, without tested solution) and At was the absorbance in the presence of the tested solution. Trolox was used as a positive control.The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay was performed according to the original method of Benzie and Strain. The ginkgo-tested solution (10 μL) was mixed with the freshly prepared FRAP reagent (190 μL) and the absorbance was read at 595 nm after the reaction time of 4 min. The percent of Fe3+—TPTZ reduction was calculated using the formula: % reduction = [(At − A0)/At] × 100, where A0 was the absorbance of the control (blank, without tested solution) and At was the absorbance in the presence of the tested solution. Trolox was used as a positive control.The antidiabetic properties of all formulations through inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase were also tested using the preincubation methods as we previously described.For α-amylase inhibitory activity, gingko formulations (20 μL) were mixed with 20 μL α-amylase from human saliva (5 unit/mL solution in ice cold distilled water) and 40 μL of 20 mM phosphate buffered saline (pH 6.9) and preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C. A volume of 20 μL of potato starch (1% w/v in 20 mM phosphate buffered saline pH 6.9) was added after preincubation. The final concentration of all the formulations used was 6 mg/mL and α-amylase was 1 unit/mL. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, 50 μL of dinitrosalicylic acid reagent was added and incubated at 85 °C for 15 min. The volume of 450 μL of distilled water was mixed with the tested solution and the absorbance was measured at 545 nm. α-glucosidase inhibitory activity method included mixing gingko formulations (10 μL) with 10 μL α-glucosidase (1.5 U/mL in phosphate buffer) and 130 μL phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.5) and then preincubating for 15 min at 37 °C. A volume of 50 μL p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (1 mM in phosphate buffer) was reincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The enzyme reaction activity was terminated by adding of 50 μL Na2CO3 (0.1 M, pH 10). The absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Appropriate blanks and controls were carried out for both methods. Enzyme inhibitory activity was calculated from the equation % inhibition = 100 − [(At − Atb/Ac − Acb) × 100], where At was the absorbance of the test (with enzyme), Atb was the absorbance of the test blank (without enzyme), Ac was the absorbance of the control (with enzyme), and Acb was the absorbance of the control blank (without enzyme). Acarbose was used as a positive control for both methods.The pancreatic lipase inhibition assay was performed according to the method described by Spinola et al. at a wavelength of 405 nm. A volume of 40 µL of the ginkgo sample was mixed with 20 µL of the substrate solution p-NPB (10 M in ethanol 96%) and 40 µL of enzyme (2.5 g/L in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH = 8.0). The resulting mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. As a positive control, we used a solution of orlistat (6 g/L in ethanol). The inhibition activity of the lipase was calculated according to following equation: % inhibition = 100 − [(At − Atb/Ac − Acb) × 100], where At was the absorbance of the test (with enzyme), Atb was the absorbance of the test blank (without enzyme), Ac was the absorbance of the control (with enzyme), and Acb was the absorbance of the control blank (without enzyme).The BSA glycation inhibition assay we performed according to the method of Spinola et al.. Fluorescence was measured in dark microwell plates of Nunc F96. A volume of 100 µL of BSA solution (10 g/L) was mixed with 100 µL of fructose solution (0.5 M) and 40 µL of the ginkgo sample. The mixture was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and then fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. As a positive control, we used a catechin solution (6 g/L). BSA glycation inhibition was calculated according to the equation: where the symbol Ft represents the fluorescence of the tested sample and Fo the fluorescence of the blank.All absorbance and fluorescence measurements were performed with Fluostar Optima microplate reader (BMG Labtech GmbH, Offenburg, Germany).The bioaccessibility of total and individual bioactive compound (BC) was calculated from the following equations: bioaccessibility in salivary phase (%) = 100 × (BC salivary phase/BC before digestion), bioaccessibility in gastric phase (%) = 100 × (BC gastric phase/BC before digestion), and bioaccessibility in intestinal phase (%) = 100 × (BC intestinal phase/BC before digestion), where BC salivary phase, BC gastric phase, and BC intestinal phase corresponded to the total or individual bioactive compound concentration in salivary, gastric, and intestinal phases, and BC before digestion was the total or individual bioactive compound concentration before in vitro digestion.All results were evaluated using the Statistica 14.0.0.15 software package (TIBCO Software Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). RP-HPLC and results from spectrophotometric determination of phytochemical, antioxidant, and antidiabetic assays were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for comparison of means, and significant differences were calculated according to Duncan’s multiple range test. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviations (SD). A principle component analysis (PCA) between phytochemicals, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activity was performed. Data were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.","Bioavailability includes digestion and absorption efficiency of certain constituents of food and drugs digested by oral administration. Foods and drugs are mainly digested and absorbed in the small intestine after gastric digestion. In vitro bioaccessibility of the total and individual polyphenols (total phenols (TP), flavonoids (TF), phenolic acids (TPA), hydroxycinnamic acids (THA), flavonols (TFLO), flavanols (TFLA), proanthocyanidins (TPAN), quercetin (Q), kaempferol (K), isoramnetin (IzoR), and total identified flavones (TiF) and triterpene lactones (triterpene lactones expressed in gingkolide A (TTL-A) and B (TTL-B) equivalents) of ginkgo water, casein (40 mg/mL), glucose (25 mg/mL), and olive oil (5%) formulations) after in vitro digestion is presented in Table 1.The highest in vitro bioaccessibility of TP was from the ginkgo water formulation through all the stages of in vitro digestion (mouth, stomach, and small intestine). Ginkgo casein formulation also had the highest in vitro bioaccessibility of TP but only after the gastric phase of in vitro digestion. We hypothesize that low pH of the solution in the gastric phase of digestion has a positive effect on the bond between protein casein and polyphenols as protein dissociation occurs and the binding site is exposed to protein interaction with polyphenols through electrostatic interactions, which confirms Ozdal et al.. The in vitro bioaccessibility of TF varied depending on the stage of digestion. So, the highest in vitro bioaccessibility of TF was from the ginkgo casein and olive oil formulation after the oral phase, ginkgo water and olive oil formulation after gastric phase, and from ginkgo casein formulation after the intestinal phase of in vitro digestion. Ginkgo casein formulation had the highest in vitro bioaccessibility of TPA after each of the stages of in vitro digestion (mouth, stomach, and small intestine). The highest in vitro bioaccessibility of THA was detected from the ginkgo glucose formulation after the oral and gastric phases, and from the ginkgo water and glucose formulation after the intestinal phase of in vitro digestion. The ginkgo olive oil formulation had the highest in vitro bioaccessibility of TFLO, TFLA, and TPAN after each of the in vitro digestion phases (mouth, stomach, and small intestine). According to Haratifar and Corredig, 60% of green tea flavanols are degraded after the intestinal phase of digestion. The highest TTL, expressed as equivalents of ginkgolides A and B, was detected in the ginkgo olive oil formulation after the oral and intestinal phases, and in ginkgo water formulation after the gastric phase of in vitro digestion. Since most drugs are digested and absorbed in the small intestine, we suggest that the best gingko formulation for TP digestion and absorption is that with water, for TPA formulation with water and glucose, for TF and TPA with casein, and for TFLO, TFLA, TPAN, and TTL with olive oil. The in vivo bioavailability of polyphenols and triterpene lactones is very low. The highest absorption rate after the intestinal phase of digestion from the flavonoid group was recorded for isoflavones, catechins, flavanones, and quercetin glucosides and the lowest for proanthocyanidins, catechins, and anthocyanins. According to the percentage classification of Vujčić Bok et al., all of the tested gingko formulations had high (>70%) in vitro bioaccessibility of TP, TF, THA, TFLO, TFLA, and TTL after the oral phase, high (>70%) in vitro bioaccessibility of TF, TPA, TFLO, and TTL after the gastric phase, and high (>70%) in vitro bioaccessibility of TF, THA, TFLO, and TTL after the intestinal phase of in vitro digestion. Moderate in vitro bioaccessibility (35–70%) was recorded for TPA after the oral phase from the ginkgo water and ginkgo glucose formulation. After the gastric phase of digestion, moderate in vitro bioaccessibility was measured for TP from the formulation of ginkgo glucose and ginkgo olive oil, for THA from the formulation of ginkgo casein, for TFLA from the formulations of ginkgo water and ginkgo glucose, and for TPAN from the formulations of ginkgo water and ginkgo casein. Moderate in vitro bioaccessibility of TP after the intestinal phase was recorded from the ginkgo casein, ginkgo glucose, and ginkgo olive oil formulations, for TPA and TPAN from the ginkgo water and ginkgo glucose formulations, for TFLA from the ginkgo water, ginkgo casein and ginkgo glucose formulations, and for TTL from the ginkgo glucose formulation. Weak in vitro bioaccessibility (<35%) was measured for TPAN only from ginkgo water and ginkgo glucose formulations after the intestinal phase of digestion. The high in vitro bioaccessibility of the tested polyphenolic and terpene groups after almost every phase of in vitro digestion compared to the results of other authors may be due to the fact that we used standardized ginkgo leaf extracts in tablets and did not centrifuge the formulations prior to in vitro digestion. This means that after each phase of digestion, more polyphenols and triterpene lactones could be released from the grounded gingko tablets. After the oral phase, the highest in vitro bioaccessibility of the most polyphenolic groups was detected from the ginkgo water formulation for TP, the ginkgo glucose formulation for THA, and the gingko oil formulation for TFLO, TFLA, and TPAN. The highest in vitro bioaccessibility of TF was detected from the ginkgo oil formulation after the gastric phase of digestion. The in vitro bioaccessibility of TTL was the highest from the ginkgo water formulation after the gastric phase of digestion. After the intestinal phase of digestion, the highest in vitro bioaccessibility of TPA was detected from the ginkgo casein formulation.The highest in vitro bioaccessibility of the total identified flavonoids (TiF) was from the ginkgo glucose formulation after each of the in vitro digestion phases. Gingko formulations with the addition of protein, carbohydrates, and oil had significantly higher concentrations of Q, K, and IzoR after the gastric and intestinal phases compared to gingko water formulation. Additionally, all the formulations with the addition of protein, carbohydrates, and oil had high (>70%) in vitro bioaccessibility of individual compounds (Q, K, and IzoR) after each phase of digestion compared to the gingko water formulation with moderate (35–70%) in vitro bioaccessibility after most of the in vitro digestion phases. Consequently, casein, glucose, and olive oil have positive effect on the in vitro bioaccessibility of total and individual flavonols, which together with terpene lactones (ginkgolides A and B, bilobalide) represent the main components of ginkgo leaf extract. Higher concentrations of these flavonols and terpene lactones do not necessarily lead to increased bioavailability in the in vivo system.According to Kardum and Glibetic, olive oil is the best source of oleic acid, which, among other positive effects, has a stabilizing effect on phenolic compounds. Consuming foods rich in lipids might increase the absorption of flavonoids, especially Q and IsoR. The combination of fat and phenolic compounds stimulates the secretion of bile, which promotes better absorption and micellarization of individual phenolic compounds in the intestine. The results from both groups of authors correspond to our results, which show a significant increase in the in vitro bioaccessibility of individual (Q, K, and IzoR) and total flavonols (TFLO and TiF) from gingko olive oil formulation in comparison to gingko water formulation. Glycosylated quercetin and kaempferol have higher bioavailability in humans than their aglycone forms. Ginkgo formulation with glucose after almost each of the digestion phases had high in vitro bioaccessibility of individual (Q, K, and IzoR) and total (TFLO and TiF) flavonols. The formulation with carbohydrates could increase the in vitro bioaccessibility by changing the viscosity and decreasing the water activity. Kaempferol has greater chemical stability than quercetin as it has fewer hydroxyl groups. In our study, moderate in vitro bioaccessibility of Q after the oral phase was detected compared to high in vitro bioaccessibility of K from the ginkgo water formulation. After gastric and intestinal digestion, both Q and K had moderate in vitro bioaccessibility. In vitro bioaccessibility results have some limitations because long-term stability of bioactive compounds during digestion and the potential effects of gut microbiota were not tested. Choi et al., in their in vivo study on antibacterial-treated mice, investigated the effects of oral intake of microbiota and ginkgo leaf extract rich with terpene lactones (bilobalide, ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, and ginkgolide C) and flavonols (isorhamnetin, kaempferol, and quercetin) and recorded the positive influence of microbiota on the isorhamnetin bioavailability. The antioxidant activity was assessed using two standard colorimetric tests: FRAP (test based on the transfer of one electron) and DPPH (test based on the transfer of both a hydrogen atom and an electron). Both tests do not fully replicate physiological conditions, but they are fast, simple, and cost-effective. The percentage of DPPH radical inhibition and reduction percentage of Fe3+, in relation to the Trolox formulations, of ginkgo water, ginkgo casein (40 mg/mL), ginkgo glucose (25 mg/mL), and ginkgo olive oil (5%) are presented in Figure 1. After the salivary phase, the highest antioxidant activity measured by the DPPH method showed the ginkgo glucose formulation. The ginkgo formulation with water and glucose had the highest antioxidant activity measured by the DPPH method compared to all other formulations tested. After intestinal digestion, no significant differences in antioxidant activity were observed between ginkgo formulations with the DPPH method. With the FRAP method (Figure 1b), the highest antioxidant activity was recorded before digestion, and after salivary and intestinal digestion for the ginkgo water formulation and the ginkgo glucose formulation. After gastric digestion, the highest antioxidant activity was observed with the FRAP method for the ginkgo glucose formulation. According to Vujčić et al., percentages of gradation of antioxidant activity, all ginkgo formulations had high (>70%) antioxidant activity measured by the DPPH and FRAP method before and after in vitro digestion. Polyphenols are a group of specialized metabolites that have pronounced antioxidant properties. In our study, we reported high bioavailability (>70%) of the majority of the individual flavonols tested, total identified flavonoids (TiF), and total polyphenolic groups after almost every phase of in vitro digestion. The high bioavailability of ginkgo polyphenols could be responsible for the strong antioxidant activity of the ginkgo extract tested. Quercetin (Q), kaempferol (K), and isorhamnetin (IsoR) were identified as the main flavonoids in our ginkgo formulation. All identified flavonoids are strong antioxidants, according to the literature.Among antioxidants, polyphenols are known as good inhibitors of enzyme involved in the glucose (α-amylase and α-glucosidases) and lipids digestion (lipase). Inhibition of these enzymes is of great importance in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is characterized by postprandial hyperglycemia, and patients with obesity, which is characterized by hyperlipidemia. Medications such as acarbose are effective in lowering postprandial hyperglycemia, but acarbose has many unpleasant side effects such as indigestion, bloating, and diarrhea due to the fermentation of undigested sugars. Therefore, there is a need for natural preparations for the prevention and treatment of T2DM. The highest potential to inhibit α-amylase was detected for the formulation of ginkgo with glucose before and after each of digestion phases (Figure 2a). Additional oral glucose ingestion is not recommended in patients with diabetes, therefore, the best ginkgo formulation with the highest inhibition of α-amylase after the gastric and intestinal phases of digestion was that with casein or glucose (Figure 2a). Inhibition of the α-amylase enzyme results in reduced carbohydrate degradation in the upper part of the intestine and slows the absorption of starch and disaccharides ingested orally in the mouth and in the lower part of the small intestine. Compounds such as kaempferol and quercetin are known to be able to inhibit α-amylase. In our study, we detected an increase in the bioavailability of Q and K from the gingko combined with casein, glucose, or olive oil compared to the gingko water formulation (Table 1). The highest potential to inhibit α-glucosidase was detected for the ginkgo/water formulation before digestion, the ginkgo/water and ginkgo/glucose formulation after oral and intestinal digestion, and the ginkgo/olive oil and ginkgo/glucose formulation after the gastric phase of digestion (Figure 2b). α-glucosidase is located in the epithelium of the small intestine, which is why the results of the intestinal phase are the most relevant. Depending on the percentage of inhibition versus positive control acarbose, antidiabetic activity can be classified as weak (<35%), moderate (35–70%), and strong (70–100%). Consequently, the ginkgo casein and ginkgo glucose formulation had strong antidiabetic activity, according to α-amylase inhibition, and the ginkgo water and ginkgo olive oil formulation had moderate antidiabetic activity after the intestinal phase. Strong antidiabetic activity, based on the inhibition of α-glucosidase, was detected for all formulations of ginkgo after the intestinal phase of digestion. Our results on the inhibition of digestive enzymes (α-amylase and α-glucosidases) by ginkgo extracts are in accordance with the results of other authors. Therefore, the ginkgo formulation with strong inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase could be used as a potential natural hypoglycemic agent with fewer side effects than medications such as acarbose. According to Feng et al., the flavonoid fraction of ginkgo extract is the most responsible for antidiabetic activity. We detected a high bioaccessibility of TF, TiF, Q, K, and IzoR from almost all of the ginkgo formulations after the intestinal phase of in vitro digestion, which confirms the above claim. Protein glycation is known as the Maillard reaction between protein molecules and glucose molecules. It is a non-enzymatic reaction of reducing sugars and proteins that includes steps in the formation of Schiff base, Amadori products, and advanced glycation end products that are responsible for a number of disorders such as vasculopathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, cataracts, and chronic kidney disease. Given the pathological consequences of glycation, it is important to identify protein glycation inhibitors that could prevent diabetes-related complications. According to Van der Lugt et al., glycation products are formed during the intestinal phase of digestion. Therefore, the most relevant are the results of intestinal digestion in which the ginkgo casein, ginkgo glucose, and ginkgo olive oil formulations had statistically higher inhibition of BSA glycation compared to the ginkgo water formulation. All ginkgo formulations had high (>70%) inhibition of BSA glycation. Adisakwattana et al. reported moderate inhibition of BSA glycation. The higher percentage in our study might be because we used standardized ginkgo leaf extracts instead of dry ginkgo leaf. Pancreatic lipase is involved in the breakdown of fats including triacylglycerides and phospholipids that play an essential role in lipid metabolism. Obesity is highly correlated with cardiovascular disease and hyperglycemia. Orlistat is a drug available to treat obesity because it is a very good pancreatic lipase inhibitor that reduces lipid digestion and absorption at the peripheral level. However, it has many unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to find natural preparations with the same or similar action as orlistat to reduce the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Statistically higher lipase inhibition potential was recorded for the ginkgo water and ginkgo glucose formulations before and after each of the digestion phase. All ginkgo formulations had high lipase inhibition potential (>70%), indicating that all formulations could have a positive influence on weight loss and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and hyperglycemia. According to Shahidi and Ambigaipalan, the consumption of foods high in phenolic compounds is associated with a reduced risk of developing obesity. Very high bioavailability of TF was detected after every phase of in vitro digestion. This suggests that TF could be responsible for the high inhibition of the enzyme lipase.The PCA is a statistical method used to gain insight into the relationship between the phytochemical composition of the plant and the biological activity (antioxidant and antidiabetic) in plant extracts and formulations. In order to gain insight into the similarities and differences between the formulations of ginkgo and the measured parameters, we analyzed the main components with standardized in vitro bioaccessibility data, total and individual phytochemical measurement data, and antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antihyperlipidemic potential data after the intestinal phase of in vitro digestion (Figure 3a,b). The first factor and the second factor described 55.33% and 24.98% of the variance after gastrointestinal digestion. In the upper right square of the PCA diagram, there was a ginkgo water formulation with TP bioaccessibility (%), TF, THA, TFL, TFLO, and IzoR content, as well as inhibition of glucosidase and antioxidant potential measured by the FRAP method, and in the upper left square, there was ginkgo casein formulation with TF, TPAN, TFLA, TPA, TTL-A and TTL-B (%), TTL-A, TTL-B, TPAN, and TPA content, in the lower right square, there was a ginkgo glucose formulation with bioaccessibility of TFLO and THA (%), TP, Q, K, and TiF content, as well as inhibition of lipase and antioxidant potential measured by the DPPH method, and in the lower left square, there was a ginkgo olive oil formulation with bioaccessibility of TFLA, TiF, IzoR, Q, and K (%), as well as inhibition of amylase and BSA glycation. After the intestinal phase of in vitro digestion, PCA gave a clear separation of the ginkgo water formulation and the gingko casein formulation with the highest distance, suggesting significant difference between these formulations (Figure 3b). We could also observe a high distance between the ginkgo water and the gingko oil formulation, and between the ginkgo water and the ginkgo glucose formulation. The ginkgo formulations with olive oil and casein were the least distant, suggesting higher similarity between the two samples. Antioxidant potential could mainly be associated with ginkgo water and ginkgo glucose formulations because among them, the smallest distance on the PCA diagram was observed. The same formulations can be mostly associated with inhibition of lipase. This indicates a positive effect on weight loss that reduces the risk of developing hyperglycemia and the development of complex chronic type 2 diabetes. Antidiabetic activity can mostly be associated with the formulations of ginkgo with olive oil, casein, and glucose. Depending on the position of the antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic results in the PCA diagram and their mutual distance, we conclude that antioxidant and antidiabetic potential are associated with the content and bioaccessibility of most of the individual and total polyphenols, which is consistent with the literature. Triterpene lactones are far removed from the results on antioxidant and antidiabetic potential, suggesting that they lack significant antioxidant and antidiabetic activity. According to the literature, triterpene lactones are attributed mostly to the antiplatelet and neuroprotective effects.",,"Terpene lactones are the most responsible for antiplatelet and neuroprotective activity in ginkgo leaf extracts. We detected the highest in vitro bioaccessibility of terpene lactones in the intestinal phase of digestion in ginkgo olive oil and casein formulation. Therefore, consumption of ginkgo tablets with casein and olive oil could have a positive effect on antiplatelet and neuroprotective activity. The high in vitro bioaccessibility of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin in all phases of in vitro digestion was detected in the formulation of gingko protein (casein), carbohydrates (glucose), and oil (olive oil) compared to the moderate in vitro bioaccessibility of the formulation of gingko water. Therefore, consumption of ginkgo tablets with protein, carbohydrate, and oil could have positive effects on anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, radical-scavenging, and immune-modulatory activities. High-antioxidant (DPPH and FRAP), antidiabetic (α-glucosidase and BSA glycation), and antihyperlipidemic potential were detected in almost all ginkgo formulations. Ginkgo extract in combination with oil shows the best results due to its hydrophobic character. According to PCA, antioxidant and antidiabetic activity are associated with the content and the in vitro bioaccessibility of most individual and total polyphenols. We can conclude that the in vitro bioaccessibility of the ginkgo phytochemicals from standardized extract tablets depends on whether they are administered alone or combined with casein, glucose, or olive oil. Our results are a good base for future in vivo investigation of bioavailability on animals and humans and they suggest that a different approach should be taken when combining ginkgo tablets and food depending on what biological effect we want to achieve."
85,TA036552,10.1186/s12974-015-0275-y,EP2-PKA signaling is suppressed by triptolide in lipopolysaccharide-inducedmicroglia activation.,"BACKGROUND: Microglia are key players for the inflammatory responses in thecentral nervous system. Suppression of microglial activation and the resultingproduction of proinflammatory molecules are considered a promising strategy toalleviate the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Triptolide wasdemonstrated as a potent anti-inflammatory compound both in vitro and in vivo.The present study explored potential signal pathways of triptolide in thelipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response using primary ratmicroglial cells. FINDINGS: Microglial cells were pretreated with triptolide andstimulated with LPS. To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of triptolide,we used Griess reagent and Western blot for NO release and iNOS expression,respectively. Moreover, we applied microglia-conditioned medium to neuronal cellsand used the MTS assay to test cell viability. We found that triptolide inhibitedLPS-induced NO and iNOS synthesis in microglial cells, which in turn protectedneurons. To evaluate the involvement of the EP2 pathway, we used real-time PCRand Western blot to determine EP2 expression. We found that LPS induced a largeincrease in EP2 expression in microglia, and triptolide almost completelyinhibited LPS-induced EP2 expression. Using the selective EP2 agonist butaprostand the EP2 antagonist AH6809, we determined that triptolide inhibitedLPS-stimulated NO production in microglia mainly through the EP2 pathway.Additionally, by further treating triptolide-treated microglia with thedownstream PKA-specific activator 6-Bnz-cAMP or the Epac-specific activator8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP, we found that 6-Bnz-cAMP but not 8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP increasedNO production in triptolide-LPS treated microglia. These results indicate thatthe EP2-PKA pathway is very important for triptolide's effects. CONCLUSIONS:Triptolide inhibits LPS-stimulated NO production in microglia via a signalingmechanism involving EP2 and PKA. This finding may help establish thepharmacological function of triptolide in neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover,the observation of inflammatory EP2 signaling in primary microglia providesimportant evidence that EP2 regulates innate immunity in the central nervoussystem.","Zhang, Ting, Gong, Xiaoli, Hu, Guanzheng, Wang, Xiaomin",2015,Journal of neuroinflammation,2,False,False,True,,,"Microglia, the immune-like cells of the brain, play an important role in inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS). The modulation of microglial activation and their production of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines could also be a promising strategy to alleviate the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway mediates the main inflammatory responses in microglia and is thus a very attractive target for researchers and drug developers. However, the deleterious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular side effect of sustained COX-2 inhibition has led to the investigation of its downstream targets. Among these targets, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling via its EP2 receptor subtype appears to be a major mediator of inflammatory and anaphylactic reactions within both the periphery and brain. EP2 upregulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contributes to cerebral oxidative damage and secondary neurotoxicity, effects that are usually accompanied by the induction of NO synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) activities. EP2 receptor not only serves as a downstream target of COX2 but also acts to influence COX2 and iNOS expression. It was reported that iNOS and COX2 induction was completely absent in EP2 KO microglia after LPS treatment, indicating that EP2 was necessary for the induction of iNOS and COX2 after LPS stimulation. Moreover, LPS-activated microglia-mediated neurotoxicity was completely abolished in cultures lacking microglial EP2, indicating that microglial EP2 was critical to LPS-activated microglia-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro.Triptolide is the major active component of Tripterygium extracts and possesses potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Our group demonstrated for the first time that triptolide possesses potent neuroprotective properties both in vitro and in vivo. In an LPS-challenged inflammation model of Parkinson’s disease (PD), intraperitoneal injection with triptolide for 24 days significantly improved the behavior of PD rats, decreased DAergic neuron death, and increased DA levels in the striatum. Further study in primary cultured rat microglia indicated that triptolide inhibits LPS-induced microglial activation and suppresses COX-2 expression and PGE2 release. In the current study, we investigated the main pathway of triptolide in LPS-induced inflammatory responses in primary rat microglial cells. We found that triptolide suppressed LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) synthesis in primary rat microglial cells, which in turn protects neuronal cells from microglia-conditioned medium-induced cell injury. Moreover, triptolide inhibits LPS-stimulated NO production in microglia via a signaling mechanism involving EP2 and PKA.Triptolide was generously provided by Professor Peng-FeiTu (School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China). This white crystalline drug has a melting point of 226°C to 240°C and, for this study, was 98% pure, as evaluated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The following materials were used for these studies: LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), a rabbit polyclonal antibody to iNOS (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), a rabbit polyclonal antibody to EP2 (Cayman, MI, USA), a mouse monoclonal antibody to CD11b (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), a mouse monoclonal antibody to GAPDH (Sigma-Aldrich), butaprost (Cayman, MI, USA), AH6809 (Cayman, MI, USA), 6-Bnz-cAMP (BIOLOG Life Science Institute, Bremen, Germany), 8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), KT5720 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), streptomycin and penicillin (Life Technologies), 0.2-ml syringe filters, 96- and 24-well tissue culture plates, 100-mm diameter dishes (Corning, NY, USA), Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), and DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies).The immortalized murine BV2 microglial cell line was purchased from Cell Resource Center, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). MN9D cells were kindly provided by Dr. Bastian Hengerer (Novartis Institute for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland). The two cell lines were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37°C in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% streptomycin, and penicillin. The primary rat microglial cells were prepared as described previously. Briefly, cerebral cortices of 0- to 1-day-old SD rats, devoid of meninges and blood vessels, were dissociated by mild mechanical trituration. The isolated cells were seeded in 75-cm2 culture flasks (1.5 brains in a flask) in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin. The cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Fourteen days later, the microglia were separated from astrocytes by shaking the flasks at 180 rpm for 2 h. The purity of the enriched microglia was >95%, as identified by CD11b (dilution, 1:800) immunocytochemical staining. All of the results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests were used to compare the groups. The differences were considered to be significant at P < 0.05. The experimental procedures in this study were approved by the Committee on Animal Care and Usage (Capital Medical University), and efforts were engaged to minimize the number of animal usage and suffering.To confirm the anti-inflammatory effect of triptolide, we first investigated NO and iNOS production in the murine BV2 microglial cell line and in primary rat microglial cells. BV2 cells and primary rat microglial cells were cultured in 12-well plates and stimulated with LPS (0.01 μg/mL) for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, supernatants were collected. NO measurements were made using the Griess Reagent System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and iNOS expression was measured by Western blot. In BV2 cells, LPS significantly induced NO release to 8 μM compared with 1 μM in naïve cells (Figure 1A). In primary microglia cells, LPS significantly induced NO release to 12 μM compared with 2 μM in naïve cells (Figure 1B). NO is synthesized by a family of NOS consisting of three isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). Among them, NO produced from iNOS promotes the development of neurodegenerative disorders associated with inflammation. In the present study, the increase of NO correlated well with the induction of iNOS by LPS (Figure 1C, lane 2). BV2 cells and primary rat microglia both showed basal release of nitrite, which has been well demonstrated in previous reports by different laboratories. Moreover, Ryuet al. reported that neither iNOS inhibitors nor nonselective nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors had any effect on the basal release of nitrite.To investigate the inhibitory effect of triptolide on LPS-induced NO and iNOS synthesis, primary rat microglial cells were pretreated for 30 min with different concentrations of triptolide and subsequently stimulated with LPS. As shown in Figure 1A,B, triptolide dose dependently inhibited LPS-induced NO synthesis at concentrations from 12.5 to 50 nM. In BV2 cells, pretreatment with triptolide led to a dose-dependent inhibition on LPS-induced NO release by 6% (P < 0.05) at 12.5 nM, 22% (P < 0.01) at 25 nM, and 42% (P < 0.001) at 50 nM (Figure 1A). In primary microglial cells, pretreatment with triptolide led to a dose-dependent inhibition on LPS-induced NO release by 30% (P < 0.05) at 12.5 nM, 41% (P < 0.01) at 25 nM, and 61% (P < 0.001) at 50 nM (Figure 1B). As further illustrated in Figure 1C,D, the inhibitory effect of triptolide on NO synthesis was due to a dose-dependent inhibition of iNOS synthesis. iNOS synthesis was inhibited at a concentration of 25 nM and decreased significantly at a concentration of 50 nM triptolide. These results were consistent with a previous study in which Shen et al. reported that 30 nM triptolide inhibits NO production in LPS-activated macrophages.Activated microglia are capable of releasing neurotoxic molecules, such as proinflammatory cytokines and toxic oxygen and nitrogen species. Accumulating evidence shows that activated microglia can damage or kill neurons in vitro by generating nitric oxide (NO). As microglia secreted increased amount of NO in response to LPS stimulation and triptolide inhibited this effect, we reasoned that triptolide may also reduce the neuronal toxicity of LPS-stimulated microglia-conditioned medium. MN9D cell, a fusion of neuroblastoma with mice embryonic ventral mesencephalic cell, was treated with the conditioned medium for 24 h, and an MTS assay was used to assess cell viability. The medium from microglia treated with only triptolide (50 nM) exhibited no toxicity. However, a 24 h exposure to medium from LPS-stimulated microglia caused a significant decrease of MN9D cell viability to 85% of that observed for MN9D cell exposed to medium from untreated microglia. In contrast, there was no significant change of MN9D cell viability between cells exposed to medium from microglia treated with triptolide (50 nM) followed by LPS and unstimulated microglia (Figure 2A). Since triptolide alone did not change the cell viability of MN9D cells or primary rat microglial cells (Figure 2C,D), the results indicated that triptolide-treated microglia attenuated the toxicity of the LPS-stimulated microglia-conditioned medium to MN9D cells.We confirm the neuroprotective effect of triptolide in SH-SY5Y cells. The neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y is often used in the cellular model of PD due to its dopaminergic ability. As shown in Figure 2B, conditioned media from LPS-stimulated primary microglial cells significantly (P < 0.01) increased cell death of SH-SY5Y cells. Cell viability decreased to 76% of cells treated with medium from untreated microglia. This result is consistent with that reported by Liu et al., Munch et al., and Tseng et al.. In contrast, the conditioned media from primary microglia cells pretreated with triptolide prior to LPS stimulation showed little neurotoxicity on SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting that triptolide suppresses microglia-mediated neurotoxicity.To further investigate the role of NO release from microglia in toxicity of microglia to neuronal cells, we treated microglial cells with peroxynitrite (ONOO-) decomposition catalysts FeTMPyP [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(n-methyl-4′-pyridyl) porphinato iron (III) chloride]. NO reacts with superoxide (O2−), producing the highly reactive and toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO-). In the present study, we observed FeTMPyP at 10 μM blocked the LPS-induced microglial neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 2B), indicating peroxynitrite is a main mediator for the neurotoxicity of LPS-induced microglia.The above findings that triptolide reduced the amount of proinflammatory factors in microglia and protected neurons from NO stimulation may help establish the pharmacological function of triptolide in neurodegenerative disorders.Microglial EP2 is critical to the neurotoxicity caused by the activation of cerebral innate immunity. To investigate whether EP2 is involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of triptolide in LPS-stimulated microglia, we first examined EP2 expression in primary rat microglial cells. We observed the basal expression of EP2 in resting microglia (Figure 3A). As a stimulatory G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), EP2 activation stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC). This effect results in an elevation of cytoplasmic cAMP levels, initiating multiple downstream events. To assess the functionality of the EP2 receptor in microglia, the cAMP level was determined by treating microglia with butaprost (10 μM), a selective EP2 agonist, or with AH6809 (10 μM), an EP2 antagonist. As shown in Figure 3B, there was a trend of increased intracellular cAMP accumulation in microglia treated with 10 μM butaprost for 3 h compared to control. By contrast, the treatment of microglia with 10 μM AH6809 for 3 h decreased the intracellular cAMP accumulation. Butaprost alone increased the basal level of microglia NO production (Figure 3C). This may be due to the iNOS expression influenced by butaprost; as Quanet al. reported, iNOS mRNA level in resting rat microglia was increased more than tenfold after 200 nM and 2 μM butaprost treatment. Another EP2 agonist, ONO-AE1-259 was also reported to increase iNOS mRNA level in ileal tissue. By contrast, AH6809 inhibited LPS-induced NO synthesis (Figure 3D). Since NO levels in the medium are also affected by proliferation and death of the treated microglia, we observed the cell viability after EP2 agonist and antagonist and the PKA agonist and antagonist treatment in BV2 cells and found no changes (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Thus, under an innate inflammatory stimulus, microglia EP2 signaling potentiated a classically activated proinflammatory response, inducing NO production.To evaluate the involvement of the EP2 pathway in triptolide’s effect, real-time PCR of EP2 was performed on a Stratagene Mx3000P (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using the following parameters: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min using the specific primer sets. The following primer pairs were employed: 5′ - TTGCTCTTCTGTTCTCTGCCG - 3′ (upper, 538 to 558) and 5′ - CAGCTGAAGGTATGCGGTCC - 3′ (lower, 642 to 623) for the amplification of rat EP2 receptor (GenBank accession No. NM_031088) and 5′ - ATCGCTGACAGGATGCAGAAG - 3′ (upper, 925 to 945) and 5′ - AGAGCCACCAATCCACACAGA - 3′ (lower, 1,032 to 1,012) for the amplification of rat β-actin. Firstly, we observed the EP2 mRNA level at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after LPS induction and found that LPS augmented the EP2 expression significantly at 6 h (Figure 4A). The relative expression level compared with that of resting microglia increased to nearly 12-fold with LPS, which is similar as that reported by Noda et al.. Moreover, we observed a prompt downregulation of EP2 mRNA level after 12-h LPS treatment. Johansson et al. reported that stimulation of macrophages with LPS (10 ng/ml) induced a rapid increase in EP2 mRNA within 1 h followed by a prompt downregulation by 6 h. The different time of EP2 mRNA upregulation between macrophages and microglia maybe caused by their local microenvironment, as well as the differences between periphery and central inflammation, but the similar changes of EP2 expression induced by LPS indicate that EP2 expression is tightly regulated by inflammatory stimuli.To investigate the effect of triptolide on LPS-regulated EP2 expression, microglia were pretreated for 30 min with triptolide (50 nM) and subsequently stimulated with LPS. As shown in Figure 4B, 50 nM triptolide almost completely inhibited LPS-induced EP2 expression. To confirm the triptolide inhibition of EP2 expression, we next monitored the protein level changes of EP2 by Western blot (Figure 4C,D). Although the changes in EP2 protein levels were not as dramatic as were observed for mRNA levels, triptolide did inhibit EP2 protein expression.To confirm the necessary role of EP2, we treated primary rat microglial cells with butaprost/AH6809 and triptolide before LPS stimulation. As shown in Figure 5A, treatment with triptolide or AH6809 (10 μM) alone both decreased NO production in LPS-treated microglia to similar levels as were observed in normal microglia. Moreover, the combination of triptolide and AH6809 failed to further decrease NO production. Conversely, the addition of butaprost (0.1 μM) partially reversed the triptolide-induced inhibition of NO production (Figure 5A). Taken together, these results demonstrate that triptolide inhibits LPS-stimulated NO production in microglia via a signaling mechanism involving EP2. These results also indicate that triptolide regulation of the EP2 pathway is a potential therapeutic mechanism for the treatment of inflammation-related neurological disorders.EP2 activation leads to increased levels of cytoplasmic cAMP, which then initiates multiple downstream events via the PKA or Epac pathways. To differentiate between these two pathways, we added the PKA-specific activator 6-Bnz-cAMP (6Bnz) or the Epac-specific activator 8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP (8-CPT) to triptolide-treated microglia. We found that 6Bnz (10 μM) but not 8-CPT (10 μM) increased NO production in triptolide-LPS treated microglia (Figure 5B), indicating that EP2-PKA was mainly involved in the triptolide inhibition. This specificity was most likely due to the nature of LPS stimulation. Peters-Golden et al. reported that in rat alveolar macrophages, the down-modulation of LPS-induced TNF-α by PGE2 is dependent on cAMP-PKA activation. This was concluded given that the selective PKA activating cAMP analog 6Bnz but not the Epac-1 activating analog 8-CPT inhibited TNF-α production. Their recent work also indicates that EP2-PKA, rather than Epac-1, is involved in the enhancement of LPS-induced NO. This result suggests that the EP2-PKA pathway is very important for the anti-inflammatory effect of triptolide in microglia. More studies are needed to clarify whether the EP2-PKA signaling pathway is the dominant mediator of harmful EP2-mediated effects in microglia.We further observe this effect in BV2 cells, and found 6Bnz (10 μM) increased NO production in triptolide-LPS treated microglia (Figure 5C). To confirm that PKA is indeed responsible for the inhibition of NO generation by triptolide, BV2 cells were pre-treated with the PKA inhibitor KT5720, and the PKA-specific activator 6Bnz was added before triptolide treatment. We found that 6Bnz (10 μM) increased NO production in triptolide-LPS treated microglia, KT5720 attenuated NO production to an extent similar to that observed with triptolide treatment (Figure 5C), suggesting that PKA is responsible for the triptolide inhibition.The direct target of triptolide in the regulation of EP2-PKA pathway remains unknown. Liu et al. report that triptolide directly binds to human XPB, a subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH, leading to the inhibition of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in tumor cells. However, these authors used higher concentrations of triptolide (1 to 100 μM) to inhibit tumor cell proliferation. We used lower concentrations of triptolide (no more than 50 nM) to suppress inflammation and to protect neurons in the brain. Therefore, different targets may exist for triptolide with respect to the modulation of the inflammatory response in the CNS. Recently, Shen et al. reported that triptolide inhibited TAK1 kinase activity by interfering with the formation of the TAK1-TAB1 complex, and that the binding affinity of triptolide to TAB1 was highly correlated with the inhibitory activity of triptolide against the MAPK pathway activation in macrophages. Although macrophages and microglia are both tissue-resident immune cells during inflammation and the effective triptolide concentration was similar in both cell types, it remains to be investigated whether TAB1 is the target of triptolide in microglia.",,"The present study demonstrates that triptolide inhibits LPS-stimulated NO production in microglia via a signaling mechanism involving EP2 and PKA. The finding that triptolide reduces the proinflammatory factors in microglia and protects neurons from inflammatory stimulation may help establish the pharmacological function of triptolide in neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, the observation of inflammatory EP2 signaling in primary microglia also provides important evidence with respect to EP2 in the regulation of innate immunity in the CNS."

[\\[8–](#page-10-5)[10\\]](#page-10-6) Inspired by these previous findings, we have embarked an investigation on *G. sinensis*, leading to the isolation of (±)-sinensilactam A and biologically important meroterpenoids with a para-hydroxycinnamyl group in the structure [\\[11–](#page-10-7)[13\\]](#page-10-8). As a continuous study on *G. sinensis*, the current investigation resulted in the characterization of five new meroterpenoids, zizhines P−S and U (**1**−**4**,**7**) along with two previously reported meroterpenoids (**5** and **6**) (Figure [1\\)](#page-1-0).

""]nan","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['**2. results and discussion 2. results and discussion** ', '*2.2. biological evaluation* *Ganoderma* fungi have been reported to be beneficial for cancer patients [\\[16\\]](#page-10-11).

Meroterpenoids are widely present in the genus *Ganoderma* [\\[22\\]](#page-11-2). However, such compounds were largely ignored before 2013. Thereafter, increasing numbers of meroterpenoids were characterized by us. Our previous study disclosed that meroterpenoids are also in vitro active toward cancer cells [\\[23](#page-11-3)[–25\\]](#page-11-4). Whether meroterpenoids resulting from the present study are also potent against cancer cells needs examination. Herein, all the isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity toward three human cancer cell lines and HDF (normal human embryonic lung fibroblasts). It was found that only BGC-823 and KYSE30 cells are sensitive to compounds **5** and **6**, and A549 cells are sensitive to compound **4**, all the other compounds are not active (Table [4\\)](#page-7-0). Although the cytotoxic potential of the active compounds are not so strong indicated by their larger IC<sup>50</sup> values, they appear to be not harmful to human normal cells (HDF) with IC<sup>50</sup> values larger than 160 µM. Cytotoxicity assay is just one approach to evaluate the role of the compounds against cancer, the derivatives of such meroterpenoids was found to be active toward Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) [\\[26\\]](#page-11-5), indicating the usefulness of such meroterpenoids in cancer from an alternative aspect. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new screening methods to gain a deep insight into the biological role of the isolated meroterpenoids. <span id=""page-7-0""></span> | Compound | Cell Lines (IC50, µM) |                   |                  |                 |  |  | |----------|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|--|--| |          | BGC-823               | KYSE30            | A549             | HDF             |  |  | | (−)-1    | >160                  | >160              | >160             | >160            |  |  | | (+)-1    | >160                  | >160              | >160             | >160            |  |  | | (−)-2    | >160                  | >160              | >160             | >160            |  |  | | (+)-2    | >160                  | >160              | >160             | >160            |  |  | | 3        | >160                  | >160              | >160             | >160            |  |  | | 4        | >160                  | >160              | 72.13 ±<br>8.7 * | >160            |  |  | | 5        | 59.2 ±<br>2.73 *      | 76.28 ±<br>1.93 * | >160             | >160            |  |  | | 6        | 64.25 ±<br>0.37 *     | 85.42 ±<br>2.82 * | >160             | >160            |  |  | | 7        | >160                  | >160              | >160             | >160            |  |  | | 5-FU     | 37.72 ±<br>1.87       | 8.43 ±<br>0.19    | 35.02 ±<br>2.42  | 51.07 ±<br>2.43 |  |  | |  | Table 4.

87,TA050327,10.3390/md16020064,The Anti-Cancer Effects of Frondoside A.,"Frondoside A is a triterpenoid glycoside from the Atlantic Sea Cucumber,Cucumariafrondosa. Frondoside A has a broad spectrum of anti-cancer effects,including induction of cellular apoptosis, inhibition of cancer cell growth,migration, invasion, formation of metastases, and angiogenesis. In cell lines andanimal models studied to date, the anti-cancer effects of the compound are seenin all solid cancers, lymphomas, and leukemias studied to date. These effectsappear to be due to potent inhibition of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), which isup-regulated in many cancers. In mouse models, frondoside A has synergisticeffects with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine,paclitaxel, and cisplatin. Frondoside A administration is well-tolerated. No sideeffects have been reported and the compound has no significant effects on bodyweight, blood cells, or on hepatic and renal function tests after long-termadministration. Frondoside A may be valuable in the treatment of malignancies,either as a single agent or in combination with other therapeutic modalities.","Adrian, Thomas E, Collin, Peter",2018,Marine drugs,2,False,False,True,"There is a desperate need for new and effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. It is particularly important to target growth, survival, migration, and metastases pathways in cancer with agents that have little or no toxicity towards normal cells. Over the years, there has been a search for such novel drugs in natural products. Many plant-derived compounds have been developed and used for treating cancer. Examples include doxorubicin, bleomycin, mitomycin, vincristine, and vinblastine. Marine organisms represent a vast untapped potential source of anti-cancer compounds and considerable effort has been invested in this area in recent years. To date, there has been limited success in terms of marine-derived compounds or direct synthetic analogs of marine-derived compounds reaching the market for treatment of cancer and other disorders. The four notable exceptions for the treatment of cancer include cytarabine, trabectedin, eribulin mesylate, and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Cytarabine, the pyrimidine nucleoside, 3-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine was synthesized following the discovery of arabinose-containing spongonucleosides from the sponge, Cryptotethia crypta. Cytarabine becomes incorporated into DNA in the place of a cytosine residue and halts DNA synthesis in the S phase of the cell cycle. It is used in the treatment of acute lymphocytic and myeloid leukemias, as well as chronic myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Gemcitabine, which is important in the treatment of pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer, is a fluorinated analog of cytarabine. Trabectidine is a tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid produced synthetically. Trabectidine was originally isolated from the mangrove sea squirt Ecteinascidia turbinata but was subsequently shown to be produced by Candidatus Endoecteinascidia frumentensis, a microbial symbiont of the tunicate. Trabectidin inhibits activated transcription, notably of the drug resistance proteins, which are recognized to be the major pathways of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin and the taxanes. Eribulin mesylate is a synthetic analogue of halichondrin B, a mitotic inhibitor from Halichondria sponges, which is used to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer or inoperable liposarcoma. Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) is a synthetic highly potent antimitotic drug that is derived from peptides occurring in the marine shell-less mollusk, Dolabella auricularia called dolastatins. Because MMAE is highly toxic it is linked to a monoclonal antibody (MAB) that targets a membrane protein, CD30 found on anaplastic large cell lymphoma and Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells.The search for anti-cancer compounds across different marine phyla has so far revealed several thousands of active compounds. Of particular interest are echinoderms, which are phyla only found in the marine environment, which includes sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, and sea lilies. Sea cucumbers have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of cancer, inflammation, and other conditions for hundreds of years.Triterpenoid glycosides from various sea cucumber species are known to have anti-cancer activity. One particular triterpenoid glycoside, frondoside A has received particular attention, since it has shown potent anti-cancer effects in a broad spectrum of solid malignancies as well as in leukemias. Here, we will review the nature of frondoside A, its effects on cancer cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and formation of metastases. We will also review the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, interactions with other anti-cancer therapeutics, effects on the immune system, and possible mechanisms of action of this compound.Frondoside A is a triterpenoid glycoside with an acetoxy group at C-16 in the aglycone, which is a lanostane derivative. Frondoside A is a pentaoside with xylose as the third monosaccharide residue and 3-O-methylglucose as the terminal monosaccharide residue. It has a sulphate group on the first sugar residue. For the structure of frondoside A see Figure 1. Frondoside A differs from its closest cousin cucumarioside A2-2 (from Cucumaria japonica) in the functional group at C-16 of the aglycone (a keto group in cucumarioside A2-2) and the third carbohydrate group in the carbohydrate chain (glucose in cucumarioside A2-2). Frondosides B and C, also derived from Cucumaria frondosa, are found at slightly higher concentrations and have two and three sulphate groups, respectively, and some other minor structural differences compared with one in frondoside A (see Figure 1). Frondoside A has a molecular mass of 1334 Da.The frondosides (A, B and C) can be readily isolated and purified, as previously described. The resulting compounds have been shown to have high purity. Frondoside A is extracted from either the freeze-dried cooking water from the sea cucumber processing plant or from freeze dried skin of the animal. Briefly, the freeze dried powders are dissolved in chloroform/methanol. Following evaporation, the extract is dissolved in water and mixed with ethyl acetate. After phase separation, the water phase is then loaded onto a Teflon column (DuPont 9B, Wilmington, DE, USA). The column is then washed with water to remove salts and pigments and the crude glycoside fraction eluted with 65% acetone. The glycosides are then purified on a Si 40 L 2632-2 flash column (Biotage, Charlotte, NC, USA) with the mobile phase mixture of chloroform/ethanol/water (100:100:17) as solvent. Purification is monitored by thin layer chromatography with 100:100:17 chloroform/ethanol/water as the solvent system. The frondoside A yield is approximately 0.1% of either starting material.The ability of frondoside A to form supramolecular complexes with cholesterol was investigated using transmission electron microscopy. The tubular nanoparticles that were detected were comprised of frondoside with cholesterol.The effects of frondoside A on cell viability or proliferation has been tested using multiple different methods in many different cancers. This has included studies on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, breast, non-small cell lung, colon, prostate, cervix, bladder (transitional cell), Burkitt lymphoma, malignant germ cell, and acute leukemias. Methods employed have included cell counts, thymidine incorporation, MTT assay, and CellTiterGlo (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) assays. The results summarized as approximate IC50 are shown in Table 1. The IC50 for the effect of frondoside A from these studies across different cancer cell lines varies only between 0.1 and 3.0 µM. In the instances where the effect of frondoside A has been tested on immortalized non-malignant cell lines, these are much less responsive than the malignant cells, particularly when compared under identical conditions.As mentioned above, several other sea cucumber-derived glycosylated triterpenoids have anti-cancer effects. The activity of frondoside A was compared with frondosides B and C. In AsPC-1 and S2103 human pancreatic cancer cells studied in culture, frondoside A more potently reduced the number of viable cells than its disulphated cousin, frondoside B. The trisulphated frondoside C and the parent aglycone had no effect on cell viability.Frondoside A was submitted to the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program and was run twice through the NCI-60 cancer cell line screen. This screen includes leukemia and non-small cell lung, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast cancer cell lines. Out of 57 cell lines investigated, frondoside A inhibited growth with ED50 below 1 µM for all but four cell lines (two melanoma, one renal, and one ovarian) (Coastside Bio Resources—unpublished data). The results of studies of frondoside A undertaken in mice are summarized in Table 2. Frondoside A at an intraperitoneal (IP) dose of 10 µg/kg/day significantly reduced growth of AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer subcutaneous xenografts in athymic mice over a 32-day period. No significant changes in body weights between frondoside A and vehicle control-treated animals were seen in these experiments. In xenografts of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells the effect of frondoside A at 100 µg/kg/day IP was more effective than in the pancreatic cancer model. Treatment began when the tumors averaged 200 mm3 in size. While tumors in the control group continued to grow exponentially, tumors in the frondoside A-treated group were reduced to almost nothing after treatment for 24 days. Tumor weight was similarly dramatically decreased by frondoside A. Again, there was no difference in body weight between treated and control animals. Subcutaneous frondoside A also inhibited the growth of LNM35 lung cancer cell xenografts. By the end of a 10-day treatment period, frondoside A at a dose of 10 µg/kg/day IP had reduced tumor growth by more than 40%. Increasing the IP frondoside A dose to 1000 µg/kg/day IP did not improve the efficacy of the compound, suggesting a narrow therapeutic window.Frondoside A caused similar reductions in size of prostate cancer xenografts, using both PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells. For PC-3 cells treated with 100 µg/kg/day IP frondoside A, there was a modest inhibition of tumor growth over the 30-day treatment period. Because they were less sensitive to the drug in vitro, animals with DU145 cells xenografts were treated with a higher dose (800 µg/kg/day IP) of frondoside A. This caused a more substantial reduction in tumor growth. In prostate cancer cells, the effects of frondoside A appear to be cell line dependent. In cultured PC-3 cells, frondoside A caused a dose-responsive increase in cells arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and a reduction in the proportion in the G0/G1 phase. In contrast, in DU145 and LNCaP cells no changes in the proportions of cells in the different phases were seen. Similarly, there was no significant effect of frondoside A on cell cycle phase distribution in prostate cancer cells. In four Burkitt lymphoma cell lines (BL-2, CA46, Namalwa, and Ramos) frondoside A caused a dose-responsive increase of cells in the G1 phase, with no significant changes in other phases.In cultured AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, frondoside A was shown to induce apoptosis, as indicated by morphological changes, including cytoplasmic shrinkage, membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and loss of adhesion. The induction of early and late apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V binding, which indicates the externalization of phosphatidylserine and by terminal deoxynucleotidyl triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, indicating DNA fragmentation, respectively. The apoptosis was associated with an increased expression of the pro-apoptosis protein, Bax, decrease in expression of the anti-apoptosis proteins, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and activation of caspase 3, 7, and 9 by cleavage. In pancreatic cancer cells, frondoside A also resulted in a time-dependent increase in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. The increased expression of p21 is not a response to increased p53 activity, as p53 is mutated and inactive in the pancreatic cancer cells studied. These findings indicate that in pancreatic cancer, frondoside A induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, while effects via death receptors were not investigated. In cultured MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, frondoside A induced apoptosis, as indicated by an increase in proportion of cells in the sub-G1 fraction in fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and by increased activity of caspase 3/7, as well as caspase 8 and caspase 9. Activation of caspase 3/7 was blocked by the caspase inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK. In studies by the same group, frondoside A induced a similar increase in caspase 3/7 activity in LNM35 lung cancer cells. In cultured PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, frondoside A was shown to induce apoptosis by both the sub-G1 fraction during cell cycle analysis and increase in annexin V binding. The pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK significantly decreased induction of apoptosis in DU145 cells, but not in PC-3 of LNCaP cells. The apoptosis induced by frondoside A was accompanied by induction of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and activation, upregulation of the pro-apoptosis factors Bax and PTEN or Bad and downregulation of the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2. In PC-3 and DU145 cells, frondoside A increased the level of phosphor-mTOR and expression of p21. In contrast, expression of p21 was decreased in frondoside A-treated LNCaP cells. In addition, frondoside A also inhibited pro-survival autophagy in prostate cancer cells.In the bladder urothelial carcinoma cell line, RT112 frondoside A induced caspase-independent apoptosis. Frondoside A induced a concentration-dependent increase in expression of Bax and p21, activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. The induction of apoptosis was not affected by pre-treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. As in pancreatic cancer, the increase in p21 expression was not driven by a change in p53 and inhibition of p53 activity did not suppress frondoside A induced cell death. As in prostate cancer cells, frondoside A inhibited pro-survival autophagy in RT112 cells with time and concentration-dependent accumulation of the autophagy-related proteins, LC3B-II and p62 and accumulation of cellular autophagosomes.In Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, CA46, Namalwa, Ramos, and BL-2, frondoside A induced phosphatidyl serine externalization, caspase-3 activation, decreased expression of BCl-2 and survivin, increased the cytoplasmic content of cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), as well as DNA fragmentation, indicating apoptosis. However, again the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK did not diminish frondoside A-induced apoptosis in any of the tested cell lines, indicating that the induction of apoptosis was not caspase-dependent. Similarly, frondoside A inhibited pro-survival autophagy in RT112 cells with time-dependent accumulation of the autophagy-related proteins, LC3B-II and SQSTM1/p62. Furthermore, the effects of frondoside A were independent of p53 status and the apoptosis induction was not antagonized by p53 inhibition. In vitro treatment of NCCIT and 2102EP germ cell tumor lines resulted in caspase-independent apoptosis and the use of the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK confirmed that extensive apoptosis occurred despite caspase inhibition. As in the Burkitt lymphoma cells, the apoptosis was associated with increased accumulation of AIF, and again frondoside A inhibited pro-survival autophagy. In HL60, THP-1, and NB4 human leukemia cells, frondoside A induced time and concentration-dependent apoptosis, as indicated by annexin V binding. In HL60 cells, apoptosis was not associated with a change in mitochondrial permeability or cytochrome C release into the cytoplasm. However, after six hours of frondoside A treatment there was an increase in the activation of caspases 3, 7, 8, and 9, and cleavage of PARP. Depending on the time point or concentration of frondoside A, pretreatment of HL60 cells with caspase inhibitors, Z-DEVD-FMK or Z-VAD-FMK had little or no effect on the induction of apoptosis, indicating once again that the apoptosis in leukemia cells was caspase-independent. For many years, caspase-dependent apoptosis was considered synonymous with programmed cell death, however it has become evident in recent years that there are caspase-independent forms of programmed cell death. It is likely that alternate or backup pathways evolved as the caspase-dependent pathway could be circumvented by viruses or cell transformation. A classification of different pathways of programmed cell death was proposed by Leist and Jäättelä. Their classification was based on both morphological and biochemical criteria and included three forms of programmed cell death in addition to classical necrosis. The first was the classical, caspase-dependent apoptosis with cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, phosphatidylserine relocation to the outer cell membrane, activation of the caspase cascade, and internucleosomal DNA cleavage. The second was apoptosis-like cell death with less compact chromatin condensation, phosphatidylserine translocation, but without activation of the caspase cascade. The third was necrosis-like cell death occurring in the absence of either chromatin condensation or caspase activation. In addition, it is now clear that there are other specialized forms of programmed cell death not fitting into the above models, including paraptosis and dark cell death. Finally, another form of programmed cell death is autophagy, characterized by marked cytoplasmic vacuolization, where cellular components are destroyed through an autophagosomic-lysosomal pathway. Activation of the death receptor pathway by the binding of tumor necrosis factor-α associated ligands or the Fas ligand to their respective receptors can induce either classical apoptosis or necrosis-like cell death, depending on the experimental conditions. In addition, knockout studies have revealed that necrosis-like cell death triggered through the death receptor pathway requires Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-mediated activation of the protein kinase receptor interacting protein (RIP), which activates nuclear factor kB (NF-κB). The molecular mechanisms of death receptor-mediated cell death have not been completely characterized, but mitochondrial dysfunction and non-caspase-proteases appear to be involved in this process. In the presence of caspase inhibitors, death receptor-mediated necrosis requires a mitochondrial step, but Bid cleavage and mitochondrial cytochrome c release are not involved. In contrast, necrosis-like cell death is associated with the increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and antioxidants can block this form of cell death. Thus, there are several possible mechanisms to account for the observed caspase-independent programmed cell death that is seen in several of the frondoside A-treated cell lines.Extensive studies have been carried out using caspase inhibitors, particularly the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. These studies have revealed that apoptosis can be slowed but never completely prevented by the inhibitor, suggesting that caspase-dependent and independent apoptosis pathways may be triggered simultaneously. Indeed, it has been proposed that no experimental system exists where Z-VAD-FMK can prevent cell death. This has been tested with many different apoptosis triggers and induction of apoptosis through both the death receptor-mediated and intrinsic mitochondrial pathways. It is also possible that pan-caspase inhibitors, such as Z-VAD-FMK do not completely inhibit activity of all pro-apoptotic caspases. Furthermore, their inhibition of other proteases, such as calpains and cathepsins may add to the difficulty in interpreting experimental data. Caspase-independent apoptosis pathways are likely to involve other mitochondrial proteins, such as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), as well as other cellular proteases. AIF is found in the slime mold, Dicostelium discoideum, which predates the evolutionary development of caspases. Non-caspase proteases that appear to be involved in programmed cell death include granzymes A and B, HtrA2, which is released from mitochondria, cathepsins B and D, and calpains.Frondoside A has been shown to have antiangiogenic effects in the chick chorioallentoic membrane (CAM) assay, inhibition of vascular tube formation in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and in xenografts of human lung tumors. In the CAM assay, frondoside A caused concentration-dependent inhibition of basal angiogenesis at concentrations as low as 100 and 500 nM. Furthermore, frondoside A (500 nM) completely abolished the increased angiogenesis that was triggered by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 2 µg/L. When cultured on Matrigel-coated plates, HUVEC cells spontaneously form vascular tube-like structures. Frondoside A (500 nM) almost completely abolished vascular tube formation at a concentration of (500 nM), but had no significant effect on the viability of the HUVEC cells at this concentration, indicating a lack of cytotoxicity on the HUVEC cells. Microvessel density, measured by CD31 immunohistochemical staining in the periphery of xenografted tumors, was markedly reduced by frondoside A in animals treated with a dose of 10 µg/kg/day IP.Progression of cancer is associated with loss of the normal constraints on cellular migration and invasion. Frondoside A has been shown to inhibit migration and invasion of both breast and lung cancer cells. Migration is measured microscopically in the wound-healing model, where a 1 mm scrape is made with pipette tip though a confluent monolayer of cells, as cells move in to fill the gap. Frondoside A caused concentration and time-dependent inhibition of migration of MBA-MD-231 breast cancer cells and LNM35 lung cancer cells at concentrations (0.1–1.0 µM) that have no effect on viability during the time interval of the wounding assay. The effect of frondoside A on invasion was measured using the Matrigel invasion assay in the same cell lines. Frondoside A caused concentration-dependent inhibition of invasion over a 24-hour period. Marked inhibition of invasion was seen at frondoside A concentrations (0.1–0.5 µM) that had little or no effect on cell viability.In a separate study in MDA-MB-231 cells, frondoside A inhibited TPA-induced colony formation, migration, and invasion associated with reduction in the expression, secretion, and enzymic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), enhanced expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 and 2 (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2), as well as reduced activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1, a heterodimer of c-Fos and c-Jun) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factors. These findings suggest that the inhibition of invasion is mediated via the changes in these factors.Frondoside A has been shown to inhibit formation of metastases in breast, lung, and prostate cancers. For example, breast cancer metastases were investigated after 66.1 mouse mammary cancer cells, pretreated with frondoside A, or control vehicle, for 30 minutes, were injected into the tail vein of mice and the spontaneous development of lung metastases counted after three weeks. In this model, pretreatment with 5 µM frondoside A IP reduced the number of lung tumor colonies by 45%. In a separate experiment, 1 µM frondoside A IP also markedly reduced the formation of metastases, while exposure to 0.1 µM frondoside A was ineffective. In a more clinically relevant model, the 66.1 cells were implanted subcutaneously proximal to the right mammary gland of mice and frondoside A treatment was administered IP each day for 10 days. Formation of spontaneous metastases was significantly inhibited by frondoside A at 50 µg/kg/day and even at 10 µg/kg/day the inhibition almost reached statistical significance (p < 0.06).A separate study investigated the effect of frondoside A on development of axillary lymph node metastases after subcutaneous implantation of LNM35 lung cancer cells. Frondoside A at a dose of 10 µg/kg/day IP significantly reduced the average weight of the lymph nodes by more than 50%; however, a higher dose of 1 mg/kg/day was no more effective.In xenografts comprised of PC-3 prostate cancer cells, frondoside A markedly reduced the number of lung metastases and caused a similar decrease in the presence of cancer cells detected using a human DNA detection method. With DU145 cell xenografts, there were no lung metastases detected by microscopy and there was a marked reduction in the tumor cell detection in lung using the human DNA detection method; furthermore, frondoside A significantly reduced the detection of tumor cells in the blood using this method.Development of resistance of cancer cells to antitumor drugs with completely different mechanisms of action is a well-known phenomenon, known as multidrug resistance (MDR). The major mechanism of multidrug resistance is through the upregulation of transmembrane transport proteins that efflux drugs from the cells, lowering the intracellular concentrations of drugs and rendering them ineffective. The major drug efflux protein is known as permeability glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein). Activity of P-glycoprotein can be measured by efflux of fluorescein dyes, which enter the cells by diffusion through the cell membrane. Frondoside A, or nanoparticle complexes of frondoside A with cholesterol can block P-glycoprotein activity. Inhibition of MDR was seen with a frondoside A concentration of only 750 pM (1 ng/mL) and no greater effect was seen when concentrations were increased to 7.5 or 75 nM. On a molar basis, frondoside A was more effective than verapamil, the most effective concentration of which was 26.4 nM (12 ng/mL).The results of the following studies are summarized in Table 2. In MDA-MB-231 cells in culture, frondoside A enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of paclitaxel, a drug that targets tubulin and prevents microtubule formation, in an apparently additive manner. The combination of frondoside A with cisplatin, a drug which inhibits DNA replication, was tested in the mouse xenograft model with LMN35 lung cancer cells. When administered daily, each of these drugs alone inhibited tumor growth and by the tenth day tumor size was about 40% lower in the treated groups. The combination of the two, however, suppressed tumor growth by 68% (p < 0.05). Combinations of frondoside A with both cisplatin and gemcitabine (another drug that impairs DNA synthesis) were tested in RT112 urothelial cancer cells. Both drug combinations had marked synergistic effects in these cells. Because frondoside A has similar growth inhibitory effects in cancer cells regardless of their p53 status, a study was conducted to investigate the effects of frondoside A and cisplatin after pretreating cells with pifithrin-α (Pif-α), which is a chemical inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity in wild-type p53 BL-2 Burkitt lymphoma cells. There was a clear additive effect of frondoside A and Pif-α in these experiments, while the effect of cisplatin was antagonized by Pif-α. These findings indicate that while cisplatin activity is p53-dependent, functional p53 is not required for the anti-cancer activity of frondoside A.Studies in AsPC-1 and S2013 pancreatic cancer cells revealed marked synergistic effects of low concentrations of frondoside A with gemcitabine in cell culture. Furthermore, the combination also showed enhanced effects compared with either drug alone in the xenograft model of pancreatic cancer using either cell line. Frondoside A also potentiates the actions of several conventional therapeutic agents in acute leukemia cell lines. Frondoside A enhanced the anti-leukemic effects of vincristine, asparaginase, and prednisolone in CCRF-CEM, THP-1, and HL-60 cells. Synergistic effects were seen with frondoside A in combination with each of the three other drugs in CCRF-CEM and THP-1 cells.Frondoside A exhibits a range of very potent immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in animals. While the observed effects of frondoside A in the human xenograft models in athymic mice are clearly not related to effects on the immune system, such immunological effects may contribute to the anti-cancer effects of the compound in other animal tumor models and could potentially contribute an additive effect if frondoside A becomes used as a drug in humans. Frondoside A potently stimulates lysosomal activity in mouse macrophages in vivo. The maximal stimulatory effect was seen with 0.2 µg/mouse and the effect was maintained for 10 days. This dose is similar to the lowest dose (10 µg/kg/day) that has shown anti-cancer activity in athymic mice, but it is intriguing that the effect lasts for ten days after a single dose. Frondoside A also stimulates an increase in the number of antibody plaque-forming B-cells in the spleen of mice in immunized with sheep erythrocytes, again with a maximal effect seen at a dose of 0.2 µg/mouse. Frondoside A also had a weak effect on IgM production in response to the immunization with sheep erythrocytes. However, frondoside A had no effect on immunoglobulin production in mice immunized with ovalbumin. Frondoside A stimulated lysosomal activity in mouse macrophages by 30% in vitro at concentrations of 75–285 nM (0.1–0.38 µg/mL). Frondoside A very potently enhances macrophage phagocytosis of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and stimulates production of reactive oxygen species in vitro at a maximal effective concentration of 750 pM (1 ng/mL). Hence, frondoside A is an immunostimulant of cell-based immunity including phagocytosis without significant amplification of humoral immune activity or adjuvant properties and may be valuable in treating disorders where depleted immune status contributes to the pathological process.One study investigated the protein changes that occurred in frondoside A stimulated splenocyte cultures using proteomics. Thirty proteins were differentially expressed, including down-regulation of Septin-2, a protein that hetero-oligomerizes with other septins to form filaments. Loss of Septin-2 causes actin stress fibers to disintegrate and cells to lose polarity. Other down-regulated proteins include NADH dehydrogenase iron-sulfur protein 3 (an enzyme which is a component of mitochondrial NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase), and GRB2-related adaptor protein 2 (an adaptor-like protein involved in leukocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase signaling). Up-regulated proteins include N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-like 1 cofactor p47 (a protein necessary for the fragmentation of Golgi stacks during mitosis and for their reassembly after mitosis), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (a nucleic acid-binding protein that serves as a docking platform integrating transduction pathways to nucleic acid -directed processes). Together with the results of proliferation and adhesion assays, these changes suggest that in addition to stimulating splenocyte proliferation, frondoside A has immunostimulatory effects that enhance the cellular defense mechanism necessary to fight pathogens for which lymphocytes and splenocytes need to be recruited.Another study revealed that frondoside A inhibits the non-specific esterase of mouse spleen lymphocytes, but the concentrations for this inhibitory effect was higher than required for the immunomodulatory effects.In macrophages, frondoside A stimulates spreading, lysosomal activity, and the formation of reactive oxygen species.Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from tumor cells inhibits natural killer (NK) cell functions. Indeed, several functions of these cells, including lysis, migration, and cytokine production, are compromised in tumor bearing mice. Similarly, PGE2 prevents migration, the cytotoxic effects, and interferon γ (IFNγ) production in cultured NK cells. Frondoside A, which acts as a blocker for EP4 prostaglandin receptors, inhibits breast cancer metastases in an NK cell-dependent manner and protects IFNγ production from NK cells from PGE2 mediated suppression.The pharmacokinetics of frondoside A were investigated in mice following intravenous (IV) and intraperitoneal (IP) administration at a bolus dose of 100 µg/kg. Plasma frondoside A concentrations were measured using a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The mean Cmax following IV administration of frondoside A was 129nM, while that following IP administration was 18.3 nM at 45 min, which is about seven-fold lower than with IV administration at the same dose. The calculated bioavailability after IP administration was approximately 20%. Following IV administration, plasma concentrations of frondoside A remained above 7.5 nM for 17 h, while for IP administration, plasma levels remained above this level for only 4 h. In contrast, oral dosing resulted in very low and variable plasma concentrations of frondoside A near to or below the detection limit of the assay. The half-life of IV administered frondoside A was 8.5 h.The low plasma concentrations of frondoside A after oral administration were confirmed when the effect on growth of AsPC-1 xenografts was compared with IP administration in athymic mice. While IP administration resulted in near to complete inhibition of tumor growth, oral administration was completely ineffective with the time course being almost identical to the vehicle control. These findings suggest very low bioavailability from the oral administration of frondoside A, which is likely to reflect either poor absorption or rapid digestion in the intestine. Indeed, since the aglycone showed no anti-cancer effect, it is likely that the glycosyl groups are cleaved by digestive enzymes, resulting in an inactive aglycone. The reported studies of frondoside A in vivo have failed to show any hint of a toxic effect at the studied doses, which are up to 1000 µg/kg/day. There are no apparent side effects and body weight, liver function, and hematological parameters are not adversely affected by the drug. In a study of athymic mice with MDA-MB-231 cell xenografts, frondoside A administered at 100 µg/kg/day had absolutely no effect on numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, or hemoglobin, or on plasma concentrations of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, or alanine aminotransferase. A study in mice with xenografts of PC-3 prostate cancer cells revealed no significant changes in hemoglobin, WBC, lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, or platelet counts with frondoside A at a dose of 100 µg/kg/day. At a higher dose of 800 µg/kg/day, frondoside A caused non-significant increases in WBC, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts, but a significant (p < 0.01) increase in monocyte count in mice with DU145 prostate cancer xenografts. A formal study of the toxicity of frondoside A revealed that the LD50 in mice was 9.9 mg/kg, which is 100-fold greater than the dose used in most of the in vivo experiments testing efficacy.Up until now, the mechanism by which frondoside A triggers its anti-cancer and other effects has been somewhat of a mystery and several possible mechanisms have been proposed, however new evidence reveals a unifying hypothesis that can account for most, if not all, of the observed biological mechanisms.Acting as potent inhibitor of the multi-drug resistance, G-glycoprotein would certainly be valuable in the treatment of cancer, regardless of the mechanisms that mediate the effects of frondoside A on proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Because of the steroid backbone of the molecule, an early study investigated whether frondoside A had estrogenic activity using a yeast two-hybrid system. No appreciable estrogenic activity was detected.In a study that showed marked effects of frondoside A on the inhibition of 66.1 mouse mammary cancer cell growth and the development of metastases revealed that the compound also blocked binding and activation of the EP4, and to a lesser extent, EP2 prostaglandin receptors. Frondoside A caused inhibition of tritiated PGE2 from binding to EP4 receptors with an IC50 of approximately 3.7 µM and EP2 receptors with an IC50 of approximately 16.5 µM. Frondoside A was also able to cause concentration-dependent inhibition of PGE2-stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations. Complete inhibition of PGE2-stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP was seen at a frondoside A concentration of 5 µM. Curiously, in the absence of PGE2, frondoside A at a concentration of 1 µM caused an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, almost rivalling that of PGE2. Furthermore, it is notable that the IC50 for the effect of frondoside A on cell proliferation was 0.5 µM, almost eight-fold lower than that for inhibition of PGE2 binding to EP4 receptors and 33-fold lower for EP2 receptor binding. These findings suggest that even if prostaglandin receptor blockade contributes to the anti-cancer effects of frondoside A, other more potent mechanisms are likely to be involved.Another study, which was designed to investigate the mechanism of action, employed microarray using a human oligonucleotide expression array library coupled with real-time RT-PCR to study the transcriptome of S2013 pancreatic cancer cells treated with 2μM frondoside A for 6h as compared with that of untreated cells. Expression of genes showing the greatest changes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and time-courses of gene expression were investigated in seven cancer cell lines. Marked changes were seen in expression of several genes involved in growth regulation. Downregulated genes included E2F1, cyclin A2, cdc20, cdc21, cdc45, and cdc47, all of which play important roles in DNA replication and cell cycle control. Upregulated genes included fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), growth and development factor 15 (GDF15), p21WAF-1 (which has been shown to be upregulated in multiple studies as outlined above), repressor of E1A, dual-specificity phosphatase, and death-associated protein kinase-1. Attention was focused on GDF15 and FABP3. GDF15 belongs to the transforming growth factor superfamily that plays a role in regulating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways during tissue injury, and mediates apoptosis induction in response to NSAIDS. FABP3 is a candidate tumor-suppressor that arrests growth of mammary epithelial cells. Knockdown of expression of either GDF15 or FABP3 using specific siRNA in AsPC-1 cells reversed the growth inhibitory effects of frondoside A. These findings suggest that both GDF15 and FABP3 are involved in the growth inhibitory effects of frondoside A in pancreatic cancer. Since this mechanism appears unique, it explains the synergistic anti-cancer effects seen when combined with other agents, such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine.In a study investigating the effects of frondoside A in migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, it was revealed that frondoside A could inhibit TPA-induced activation of MMP-9 via pathways involving inhibition of activation of two transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-κB. Furthermore, frondoside A reduced the ATP-stimulated phosphorylation of several kinase pathways, including phosphoinositide 3 kinase/protein kinase B pathway (PI3K/Akt), the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which are all involved in growth stimulatory and cell survival pathways. This study provided valuable insight into how frondoside A could be having widespread effects in the inhibition of cell growth, cell survival, migration, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis.A breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanisms by which frondoside A has such widespread effects came recently when a paper revealed that it was a potent inhibitor (IC50 1.2 µM) of RAC/CDC42-activated kinase (PAK1), with an IC50 around 1.2 µM in vitro (not in cell culture). Furthermore, its direct action is highly specific for PAK1, because IC50 for other kinases such as LIM kinase and AKT is around 60 μM. This potency is in line with the anticancer effects of frondoside A, which from multiple studies is approximately 1 µM (see Table 1). The discovery that frondoside A inhibits PAK1 is unifying since this kinase is upstream of several other transduction mechanisms, including Ap-1 and NF-κB, already implicated in the actions of the compound. Furthermore, PAK1 is involved in stimulating cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. PAK1 activation also potently increases angiogenesis and tumor cell-survival autophagy. So being a PAK1 inhibitor may explain the broad spectrum of biological actions on tumors, including inhibition of growth, migration, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and pro-survival autophagy, as well as the induction of apoptosis. Expression of the p21 gene is suppressed by PAK-1 and is increased by frondoside A.The major aspect of the biological effects of frondoside A that cannot be readily explained by PAK-1 inhibition are the immunomodulatory effects of the compound. PAK1 appears to act as an immuno-suppressor, and either PAK1 si-RNA or chemical PAK1-inhibition boosts the immune response in mice. However, the in vitro effects are seen at concentrations that are much lower than those that have either anti-cancer or PAK-1 inhibitory effects and the in vivo effects are seen with very low doses of the compound. One possible explanation is that the immunomodulatory effects are mediated by a metabolite of frondoside A, perhaps its aglycone, which is likely to be absorbed intact from the gut. Alternatively, perhaps the immune modulatory effects are mediated by action in the gut and do not require absorption of the compound. A recent study demonstrated that curcumin, another compound with poor oral availability but potent effects on the attenuating arthritis, was mediated by increasing neuroexcitability of the vagus nerve. It is interesting to speculate that frondoside A might also activate a similar gut/brain axis.",,,,"Frondoside A has potent anti-cancer effects in all solid malignancy, lymphoma, and leukemia cell types investigated to date. Frondoside A causes growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis inhibition of migration, invasion and metastases, and blocks angiogenesis. The effects of frondoside A are mediated by inhibition of PAK1 and perhaps other mechanisms. Frondoside A potentiates the effects of conventional therapeutic agents, such as paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine in several different cancer types. Over a fairly broad therapeutic range in experimental animals, frondoside A is well tolerated and appears to have no toxicity on bone marrow, liver, kidney, or other tissues, and does not affect body weight. Frondoside A can be readily produced from the waste-stream of certain sea cucumber processing; however, it could also be produced from cell culture of the skin from the source organism or conceivably by chemical synthesis. Frondoside A may be valuable in the treatment of a wide range of malignancies either as a single agent or in combination with other therapeutics."

METHODS: Thin film hydration method was used to prepareterpesomes according to a 3(2) full factorial design to inspect the effect ofseveral variables on vesicles' features. The investigated factors were terpenestype (X(1)) and terpenes amount (X(2)) while the dependent responses wereencapsulation efficiency percent (Y(1)), particle size (Y(2)) and polydispersityindex (Y(3)). Design Expert(®) program was used to chose the best achievedformula. The selected terpesomes were further optimized via incorporation of apositive charge inducer (stearylamine) to enhance adhesion to the negativelycharged mucus covering the eye surface. The in vivo performance of the optimizedfenticonazole nitrate-loaded terpesomes relative to drug suspension was evaluatedby measuring the antifungal activity (against Candida albicans) retained in thetear's fluid at different time intervals after ocular application in albinorabbits.

[1 In general, the ocular bioavailability](#page-0-4)  can be increased if the time for corneal permeability and precorneal drug residence could be increased. However, the main strategy to enhance corneal permeation is achieved by the use of penetration enhancers, which might lead to toxicity of the eye.[2](#page-10-0) Hence, several studies were concerned with developing systems with good adhesion characteristics, which could enhance precorneal drug residence time and consequently improve the ocular bioavailability.

In the past, wearing contact lenses and corticosteroid treatment for a long time were considered as common risk factors, however recently the increment in an immunocompromised population, resulting from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chemotherapy and surgeries, led to a dramatic rise in the fungal eye infections incidence. Azoles (compounds based on the imidazole ring) are among the main antifungal therapy groups. On the other hand, the rising resistance to azoles, primarily amongst an immunocompromised population, strongly limits the efficient therapy. Combinatorial delivery of drugs is a promising approach to avoid possible drug resistance. Lately, combining two or more active substances in appropriately designed delivery systems is increasingly used as an approach to enhance the efficacy against fungal infections.[5](#page-10-3) One of the antifungal imidazole derivatives is fenticonazole nitrate (FTN). Its mechanism of action includes inhibition of ergosterol synthesis leading to damage to the cell membrane.[6](#page-10-4) FTN exhibits fungistatic and fungicidal effects on dermatophytes, yeasts and fungi.

As a consequence, the goal of the current work was to estimate the capability of TPs to improve the ocular delivery of FTN and to assess their safety. To achieve this aim, various variables affecting vesicles\' characteristics were investigated via 32 full factorial design utilizing the Design Expert® program. The terpene type (X1) and amount (X2) were selected as independent factors, whereas entrapment efficiency percent (EE%; Y1), particle size (PS; Y2) and polydispersity index (PDI; Y3) were chosen as dependent responses. The best achieved formula was further optimized via addition of a positive charge inducer, stearylamine (SA), to improve corneal adhesion through electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged mucin.

In every rabbit, no drug was inserted in the left eye to serve as the control. At specific time intervals (1–12 hours), four sterile filter paper discs (Whatman no. 5, 6 mm in diameter) were wetted by placing the discs under the eyelid of each eye of each rabbit. For each eye (right and left), two discs were put in an Eppendorf tube (1.5 mL) which contains 500 μL Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) inoculated with 10% v/v yeast suspension (107 CFU/mL). The other two discs were put in an Eppendorf tube containing 500 μL uninoculated SDB; this was used as a blank during measuring the optical densities. Afterwards, aerobic incubation of all the tubes was carried out at 25±2 °C for 24 hours. After incubation, 200 μL of each tube was transferred to a sterile 96-well plate and the optical densities (OD600nm) were read on an automated spectrophotometric plate reader (Biotek, Synergy 2, USA) at a single wavelength of 600 nm.

']","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['**results and discussion** full factorial design analysis Design-expert® software (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) was utilized for the development of TPs according to 32 full factorial design ([Table 1\\)](#page-2-0).

This could be explained in the light of the lipophilicity of the utilized terpenes. Since FTN is a lipophilic drug, it will be expected that the EE% will increase upon increasing the lipophilic character of the terpene which is incorporated in the vesicles. In the current study, limonene showed the most hydrophobic character compared to other terpenes,[27](#page-11-11) as their log p values were 2.27, 3.52 and 4.57 for eugenol, fenchone and limonene, respectively.

As previously reported by Hathout et al[34](#page-11-16) the increase in EE% values could explain the large PS of vesicles.

89,TA040594,10.3389/fpls.2022.1063850,Genome-wide analysis of WRKY transcription factor genes in Toona sinensis: Aninsight into evolutionary characteristics and terpene synthesis.,"WRKY transcription factors (TFs), one of the largest TF families, serve criticalroles in the regulation of secondary metabolite production. However, little isknown about the expression pattern of WRKY genes during the germination andmaturation processes of Toona sinensis buds. In the present study, the newassembly of the T. sinensis genome was used for the identification of 78 TsWRKYgenes, including gene structures, phylogenetic features, chromosomal locations,conserved protein domains, cis-regulatory elements, synteny, and expressionprofiles. Gene duplication analysis revealed that gene tandem and segmentalduplication events drove the expansion of the TsWRKYs family, with the latterplaying a key role in the creation of new TsWRKY genes. The synteny andevolutionary constraint analyses of the WRKY proteins among T. sinensis andseveral distinct species provided more detailed evidence of gene evolution forTsWRKYs. Besides, the expression patterns and co-expression network analysis showTsWRKYs may multi-genes co-participate in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis. Thefindings revealed that TsWRKYs potentially play a regulatory role in secondarymetabolite synthesis, forming the basis for further functional characterizationof WRKY genes with the intention of improving T. sinensis.","Ren, Liping, Wan, Wenyang, Yin, Dandan, Deng, Xianhui, Ma, Zongxin, Gao, Ting, Cao, Xiaohan",2022,Frontiers in plant science,2,True,True,True," Toona sinensis (A. Juss) Roem, a deciduous native plant endemic to eastern and southeastern Asia and commonly known as Chinese toon, belongs to the Meliaceae family. In China, the tender buds of T. sinensis have been accepted widely as vegetables for its rich nutritional value and unique aroma. The young leaves of T. sinensis are high in amino acids, vitamins, and other nutrients that are beneficial to human health. T. sinensis is often known as traditional Chinese medicine due to the use of its numerous tissues in the treatment of various of ailments. A recent study showed that terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids, known as bioactive substances derived from the extracts of T. sinensis leaves and bark have been identified to have anti-tumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, hepatoprotective, and hypoglycemic effects. T. sinensis in Taihe, Anhui has many varieties such as ‘Heiyouchun’, the most famous variety because of its taste, aroma, and nutritional value that was offered as a tribute as early as the Tang Dynasty. In the early stage when the solar term of Grain Rain is coming, the ‘Heiyouchun’ shows the best quality, strong aroma, and good taste because its sprouts are thick, fat, and tender with the best oils, strong fragrances, and crunchiness. WRKYs are plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) and have also been found in protozoans (Giardia lamblia) and amoeboid (Dictyostelium discoideum), indicating a long evolutionary history. The DNA-binding domain of WRKY TFs is 60 amino acids long and has a highly conserved heptapeptide (WRKYGQK) signature motif on the N-terminus and a zinc finger-like motif on the C-terminus. This domain forms a four-stranded β-sheet whose stability is determined by a zinc-binding pocket at the end of the β-sheet, suggesting that the N-terminal conserved sequence can bind directly to DNA. WRKYs are classified into three categories (Groups I–III) based on the number of conserved domains and the type of zinc finger structure. The first type (Group I) has a WRKY domain at the C-terminal and N-terminal, whereas the second type (Group II) also has a WRKY domain, and both types are C2H2 type zinc finger structures. The third type (Group III) is constituted of a single WRKY domain with the zinc finger structure of the C2HC type. Further, group II proteins could be classified into five primary subgroups (IIa+b, IIc, IId+e), depending on the evolutionary relationship of the WRKY domains.Sweet Potato Factor 1 (SPF1), the first WRKY cDNA-encoding DNA-binding protein, was discovered in the 5’ upstream region of three genes associated with the synthesis of sporamin and amylase in sweet potato tuberous roots (Ipomoea batatas L.). Following that, WRKYs are found across the genome and in a multitude of crop species, including cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), mouse-ear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and sesame (Sesamum indicum L.), Banana (Musa acuminata). Significant evidence shows that WRKYs are required for a variety of physiological processes, including embryogenesis, seed dormancy and germination, trichome initiation, root growth, blooming time, fruit ripening, senescence, and metabolic activities. Additionally, WRKYs also act as both positive and negative regulators of plants’ responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. It is worth noting that the regulatory activity of WRKYs is associated with several signaling pathways, including jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid, all of which are related to abiotic stress responses.Furthermore, it is improbable that the role of WRKYs will be confined to coordinated defensive reactions. The WRKYs regulate the biosynthetic genes involved in terpenoid synthesis by activating or inhibiting transcription, either alone or in combination with other TFs. GaWRKY1 from cotton has been demonstrated to bind specifically to the W-box in the CAD1-A promoter and control the activity of the cotton CAD1 gene, implicating a role in sesquiterpene biosynthesis regulation. When methyl jasmonate induces Medicago truncatula, several WRKY genes involved in the production of defensive chemicals (terpenoids and isoflavonoids) are upregulated. In periwinkle(Catharanthus roseus), the CrWRKY1 gene is selectively expressed in roots, following JA and ethylene exposure, and it interacts with the DXS and SLS genes involved in steroid production, as well as with the regulators CrMYC2 and CrZCT. These combined results provide insights on the terpene synthase mechanism of the WRKY gene family in plants. Terpenoids are versatile natural compounds that act as metabolic mediators, ecological communicators, and plant volatiles. As vegetables, terpenes, in addition to their major contribution to the taste of the plant, also have pharmacological effects: anti-cancer, anti-viral, and cholesterol-lowering. Recently, a study discovered 109 chemicals in T. sinensis tissues, including terpenoids, phenylpropanes, and flavonoids. Since the biosynthesis of terpene compounds is usually mediated by the terpene synthase (TPS) family, it is difficult to significantly increase the content of specific terpenoids through the regulation of a single enzyme gene. WRKY gene family regulate the secondary metabolism of various plants, especially the enzymes associated with terpenes biosynthesis. In particular, the WRKY gene family in T. sinensis has not been fully described, and the roles of the genes within the species remain unknown. Therefore, it is critical to identify and fully investigate the WRKY gene family related to terpene biosynthesis in T. sinensis.As one of the best-known vegetables, few terpenoid-relative genes have been identified, and the molecular genetic basis of terpenoid biosynthesis pathways is still unveiled. This work found 78 members of the TsWRKYs genes family and determined their biochemical properties, phylogeny, gene structure, conserved motifs, gene promoters, chromosomal distribution, and evolution processes. In addition, TsWRKYs and terpenoid synthase gene expression patterns were analyzed across different young leaf sampling periods. Our study comprehensively revealed the information of the TsWRKYs, which is beneficial to promoting the discovery of its regulatory network and unique function in regulating the synthesis of volatile aromatic compounds.","The complete genome and proteome sequences of Arabidopsis were downloaded from the Arabidopsis Information Resource 1 . The T. sinensis data reported in this study are available under Accession No. CNP0000958 in the CNGB Nucleotide Sequence Archive 2 . The hidden Markov model (HMM) file of the WRKY domain (Accession Number PF03106) was downloaded from the Pfam database 3 , and HMMER3.0 was used for the identification of WRKY genes with an E-value setting of 1e-5. In addition, SMARAT 4  and CCD 5  were used to confirm all the potential TsWRKY genes. The molecular weights (Mw), instability index (II), aliphatic index (AI), the Grand Average of Hydropathicity (GRAVY), and isoelectric points (pI) of the identified WRKY proteins were predicated on the Expasy website 6 . The subcellular locations were predicted using ProtComp – Version 9 from Softberry website  7 .Multiple sequence alignments were created using ClustalW using default settings, and then the WRKY proteins conserved domain sequences were modified in GeneDoc software. The distribution pattern of intron was analyzed by the Gene Structure Display Server (GSDS)  8 . Conserved motif analysis of the identified T. sinensis WRKY proteins was carried out on the MEME online program  9 . The optimized parameters of MEME are as follows: the maximum number of motifs is 20, the motif width is between 8 and 50 aa, and the rest of the parameters are default. The promoters, which were extracted from 2000 bp upstream of the CDS region of TsWRKYs, were used for Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) prediction analysis by PlantCARE online software  10 .The Circos was used to map the TsWRKY gene information based on T. sinensis genomic data. Tandem and segmental duplication of T. sinensis WRKY genes, as well as the synteny relationship between T. sinensis and six plant species genomes, were evaluated using MCScanX and TBtools. The KaKs Calculator 2.0  was used to estimate the non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution of each duplicated WRKY gene. The sequence of WRKY proteins from Arabidopsis, tomato, citrus, maple, pineapple, and rice was downloaded from the NCBI 11 .The conserved domains from the predicted WRKY proteins sequences were confirmed using multiple sequence alignments. The amino acid sequences of WRKY proteins in A. thaliana and T. sinensis were alignment by ClustalW. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method in MEGA 7.0 with the following pa-rameters: p-distance, pairwise deletion, and 1000 bootstrap replications. The neighbor-joining tree construction method of T. sinensis and other green line species refers to the research of Rinerson. The green line species including: Micromonas pusilla, Ostreococcus tauri, Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Dunaliella salina, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Gonium pectorale, Volvox carteri, Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, Glycine max, Arabidopsis thaliana, and T. sinensis.The T. sinensis var. ‘Heiyouchun’ used in this study is universally recognized as the best variety because of its nutritional value, good taste, and unique aroma. ‘Heiyouchun’ was grown in the field at the Forestry Nursery of the Taihe County, Fuyang City, Anhui Province, China (118°48’8’’ N and 32°3’52’’ E). Young and healthy leaves with at least six branches and 5–10 cm in length were collected in four different sampling periods from March 30 to April 20, 2021. All collected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.Total RNA from samples was extracted using the RNA Extraction Kit 3.0 (Huayueyang Biotech, Beijing, China), with the RNase-free DNase I treatment to remove potential genomic DNA contamination. Qualified RNA was chosen as a template to produce the first-strand cDNA, as determined by gel electrophoresis and the A260/A280 ratio. Complementary cDNA was generated with SuperScript cDNA Synthesis Kit WX2050 (Huayueyang Biotech, Beijing, China). The specific TsWRKY gene primers were designed using Primer Premier 5, and TsActin gene served as the reference gene for normalization of the expression levels in different sampling periods.  Supplementary Table S1  presents all the primer information. The qRT-PCR was performed with a 2×SYBR Green qPCR Mix (With ROX) (Sparkjade, Shandong, China), and amplification was performed using 96-well plates and CFX96 TouchTM RT-PCR system (Biorad, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Each reaction was performed in biological triplicates. The data from qRT-PCR amplification were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCt method. A calculation of Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test was performed using SPSS statistical software version 25. A mean fold change greater than 2 and a p value less than 0.05 were considered significant differences between the two groups.","To thoroughly investigate the candidate WRKY genes in T. sinensis, 78 TsWRKY genes were finally identified, designated as TsWRKY1–TsWRKY78 based on the order of their HMM (Hidden Markov Model) search results, and were used for subsequent analysis. All extensive information TsWRKYs, including chromosomal location, subcellular localization prediction, protein length, molecular weight, GRAVY, instability index, and aliphatic index are provided on  Table S2 . Among the 78 TsWRKY proteins, TsWRKY14 and TsWRKY39 proteins were determined to be the smallest and the largest proteins, with 116 and 1161 amino acids (aa), respectively. The proteins’ mo-lecular weights varied from 13.5 to 125.8 kDa, and their pI values were from 4.94 to 9.73. According to the expected subcellular localization results, 67 and 11 TsWRKY proteins were found in the nucleus and extracellular areas, respectively. All of the TsWRKY proteins have a GRAVY of less than 0, which means that they are all hydrophilic proteins, and more information is shown in  Table S2 .Multiple sequence alignments of the WRKY domains, which cover about 60 amino acids, were used to analyze the evolutionary relationships of TsWRKY proteins. The WRKY domains of seven distinct Arabidopsis WRKY proteins (AtWRKY1, 18, 6, 8, 7, 14, and 30) were randomly chosen as representatives for further evaluation.  Figure 1  shows the substantially conserved WRKY domain sequences. The majority of the proteins in this family (76 out of 78) share the conserved WRKY domain WRKYGQK, while TsWRKY33 and TsWRKY62 differ by an amino acid.The phylogenetic analysis using the WRKY genes of Arabidopsis as a reference revealed that these TsWRKY genes are more precisely classified into groups I, II (a–e), and III. Among the 78 members of the TsWRKY family, group II contains the most TsWRKY proteins (54), followed by group I (11) and group III (11). Additionally, each category may be subdivided into numerous subcategories. There are 11 TsWRKY proteins in group I that contain two WRKY conserved domains that are classified as N-terminal WRKYs (IN) or C-terminal WRKYs (IC) depending on their locations on the protein. Group II of the TsWRKY proteins can be divided into five subgroups, including two subgroups IIa, six subgroups IIb, 27 subgroups IIc, 10 subgroups IId, and nine subgroups IIe ( Figure S1 ,  Table S2 ). The 11 TsWRKY proteins in group III contain a zinc finger motif of the form C-X7-C-X23-H-X-C, which is identical to the AtWRKY30 in Arabidopsis subgroup III ( Figure 1 ). We created a broader WRKY domain dataset for phylogenetic analysis to further understand the evolution of TsWRKYs familly.  Figure 2  shows the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed by WRKY domains for 14 species. A scattered distribution of TsWRKYs was observed in groups I, II (a–e), and III. The TsWRKYs protein sequence branched away from algae, bryopsida, and pteridophyta but showed clustering with dicotyledons and monocotyledons within each subgroup. Interestingly, the TsWRKYs protein sequence branches tend to show close proximity between the two. For example, TsWRKY35-TsWRKY57 and TsWRKY25-TsWRKY51 pairs in group IIb, and TsWRKY13-TsWRKY15, TsWRKY21-TsWRKY67 and TsWRKY48-TsWRKY65 pairs in group IId ( Figure 2 ;  Figure S2 ). Group III WRKY family members could be significantly subdivided into eight clades, but all TsWRKYs proteins were found on Clade 1, 4, 6, and 8.  Figure 3B  depicts the particular condition of the T. sinensis WRKY gene structures. The number of introns, with the exception of TsWRKY39 and TsWRKY59, ranges from 2 to 6, with an average of 3.59. The TsWRKY genes structure are composed of three exons and two introns in more than 60% (47 of the 78) of them. TsWRKY39, in particular, has the most exons and introns of all TsWRKYs, with 12 exons and 11 introns. Gene structures of genes in the same group, like IId and IIe, tend to be consistent in general.The domain prediction results ( Figure 3C ) were validated by utilizing the MEME web server. By sequencing the TsWRKY proteins, 20 distinct motifs were discovered, comprising 8-50 amino acids. The majority of TsWRKYs contained motifs 1, 2, and 5, which corresponded to the DBD domain, while others contained motifs unique to each class. For instance, motif 8 is unique to group IId, while motif 10 is found only in groups IIa and IIb. Most importantly, each class had a distinct motif organization, and two genes that were tightly clustered on the tree usually exhibited identical motif patterns. Despite their heterogeneity in size and sequence, the projected WRKY domains and other conserved domains were cross-confirmed by the two combined approaches, implying that the group classifications are reliable.CREs are genomic sequence motifs located in the 5’ upstream region of genes that bind to motif-specific proteins and function as regulatory switches for downstream genes. As shown in  Figure 4 , the upstream 2000 bp regulatory regions of all TsWRKYs were extracted, several CREs were predicted using PlantCARE, and the 20 most common were visualized using TBtools software.Our analysis revealed that T. sinensis contained many promoters’ core regulatory elements (CAAT-box, TATA-box), light responsive elements (Box 4, G-box, GT1-motif, AE-box, and TCT-motif), and W box elements. We observed a lot of abiotic stress responsive elements as well, such as wound-responsive elements (WUN-motif), drought-inducibility elements (MBS), dehydration, low-temp, salt stress responsive elements (DRE), low-temperature responsive elements (LTR and WRE3), and defense and stress responsive elements (TC-rich repeats). These are the hormone responsive elements: abscisic acid responsive elements (ABREs), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) responsive elements (CGTCA-motif and TGACG-motif), ethylene-responsive elements (EREs), auxin-responsive element (TGA-element), gibberellin-responsive elements (GARE-motif, P-box and TATC-box), and salicylic acid responsive element (TCA-element). Other CREs were also predicted, such as anaerobic responsive elements (AREs) and circadian control elements (circadian).All TsWRKYs had at least one stress response-related CREs in this investigation. A total of 65 TsWRKY genes (83.3%) had one or more ABREs, which could be a sign that they have an ABA response when they are stressed. Additionally, more than 70% of TsWRKY genes have the EREs and AREs that have been speculated as having important promoter roles. TsWRKY27 and TsWRKY72 contained 16 out of 20 promoters in their promoter regions that surpass other TsWRKY genes. We also focused on CREs involved in wound, hypothermia, and drought responses, such as WUN-motif, LTR, MBS, and TC-rich repeats. The WRKY protein can be used efficiently in conjunction with W-box regions to activate or inhibit downstream target gene transcription. It can form protein complexes with other active components, which improves transcription binding activity. Moreover, 62 TsWRKYs possessed one or even more W-boxes, implying that these WRKY genes are regulated by autoregulation or crossregulation.The 78 TsWRKY genes were dispersed randomly throughout the 28 T. sinensis chromosomes ( Figure 5 ). The bulk of the TsWRKYs were found at or at the ends of chromosomes. Of all TsWRKYs, 11 were identified on Chr24, scattered in several clusters, which is the largest number. On the contrary, there is only a single TsWRKY gene on Chr2, Chr4, Chr9, Chr10, Chr17, Chr20, Chr21, and Chr22. Tandem and segmental duplications both contribute to the generation of gene families throughout evolution. Hence, we investigated the occurrences of TsWRKY genes duplication. On cross-referencing with Holub’s published research study, 20 TsWRKY genes (25.7%) were found to be tandem duplicated. Tandem duplication event is a chromosomal region within 200 kb, including multiple (two or more) members of a gene family. There were 10 distinct pairs of tandemly duplicated genes on Chr 1, 6, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 23, and 24. In addition to the tandem duplication events, 83 segmental duplication events involving 72 TsWRKY genes were discovered using the BLASTP and MCScanX approaches.Constructing syntenic graphs between T. sinensis and several typical species allows us to investigate the evolutionary clues for the T. sinensis WRKY gene family ( Figure 6 ). The representative species consist of four dicots, Citrus clementina, Acer yangbiense, A. thaliana, and Lycopersicon esculentum, and two monocots, O. sativa and Ananas comosus. Syntenic links were found between 77 TsWRKY gene members and those in citrus (73), maple (70), tomato (70), Arabidopsis (63), pineapple (51), and rice (34). There were 136, 129, 113, 101, 73, and 45 orthologous pairings between the six species (tomato, citrus, maple, Arabidopsis, pineapple, and rice), respectively. In general, the TsWRKYs comprised more syntenic gene pairs in dicots than in monocots. C. clementina and A. yangbiense, well-known members of Sapindales, show greater synteny with T. sinensis, which belonged to Sapindales. Notably, in the interactive Venn map of WRKY genes across species ( Figure 7A ), 30 TsWRKY genes shared syntenic WRKY gene pairings with all six species, implying that these orthologous pairs existed prior to the ancestral split. Certain TsWRKY genes were shown to relate to 3, 4, or 5 collinear gene pairs (between T. sinensis and maple/citrus/tomato WRKY genes), indicating the possibility that these TsWRKY genes have significant roles in the evolution of the WRKY gene family. Syntenic gene pairings between T. sinensis and other species may be important for elucidating WRKY gene evolution. The Ka/Ks (non-synonymous substitution/synonymous substitution) ratios of the WRKY orthologous gene pairs of six species were computed to assess the evolutionary constraints operating on the T. sinensis WRKY gene family.  Figure 7B  shows that almost all TsWRKY orthologous gene pairs had Ka/Ks < 1. As a result, we speculated that the T. sinensis WRKY gene family may have been subjected to significant purifying selection forces throughout evolution.Six main expression patterns of TsWRKY genes were observed ( Figure 8 ). TsWRKY8 and 74 were upregulated at first and then downregulated, while TsWRKY12 and TsWRKY65 showed the opposite trend. Suppressed expression patterns were seen in 18 TsWRKY genes (7, 16, 17, 21, 26, 44, 46, 51, 55, 58, 59, 60, 61, 67, 69, 76, 77, and 78), while upregulated expressions were observed in 22 TsWRKY genes (5, 6, 18, 19, 22, 24, 32, 33, 35, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45, 53, 57, 62, 63, 64, 66, and 68). Furthermore, the expression of nine TsWRKY genes (2, 13, 14, 15, 23, 28, 31, 34, and 56) were first upregulated, then downregulated, and then upregulated to a high level. The other TsWRKY genes (1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 20, 25, 27, 29, 30, 36, 37, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 54, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, and 78) were not significantly altered (fold change ≥ 2) at different stages.We investigated the expression patterns of the genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in order to unravel the regulatory mechanism of terpenoid accumulation patterns in various developmental stages of T. sinensis. All of the key genes, except for TsFPPS, showed significant changes (fold change ≥ 2) in expression during development ( Figure 9B ). After April 6, the expressions of TsAACT, TsHMGS, TsHMGR, TsDXS, and TsDXR all changed distinctly. Notably, TsIDI, TsDXS, and TsDXR are more than five-fold changes in expression over four periods.The WRKYs usually control the expression of terpenoid synthesis genes by activating or repressing their promoters, thereby regulating the accumulation of terpenoids. We constructed a co-expression network of TsWRKYs with terpenoid synthesis genes ( Table S3 ;  Figure 10 ). The results showed that TsFPPS, TsIDI, TsMTPS, TsWRKY9, TsWRKY24, TsWRKY35, TsWRKY38, TsWRKY39, TsWRKY62, and TsWRKY64 are possible core members of the terpenoid synthesis co-expression network. TsFPPS, TsWRKY36, and TsWRKY75 were negatively correlated with other genes. By contrast, TsWRKY24, TsWRKY35, TsWRKY39, and TsWRKY40 are almost all positive correlated factors.","Since the first WRKY proteins were identified, WRKY TFs have been well recognized in plants for their regulating functions in defense against abiotic and biotic stresses, growth and development, and secondary metabolism. Terpenes are the signature volatile components of T. sinensis, and WRKYs are significantly involved in regulating the terpene pathway. Neither the identification of the WRKY gene nor the regulation of terpenoids, the most iconic volatile substances in T. sinensis, has been reported. We describe WRKY TFs in T. sinensis and present the associated regulatory network of terpene biosynthesis.Variation in the number of gene family members is a key mechanism for shaping adaptive natural variation during the evolution of species. We discovered 78 proper TsWRKY genes in this investigation. The results of the neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree of 14 species constructed with the WRKY protein sequence’s conserved domain indicate that they can be divided into three major groups (I–III) and five subgroups (IIa–IIe). WRKY TFs diverge early in the green lineage and TsWRKYs are more closely related to dicotyledons and monocotyledons. The number of presumed TsWRKYs are comparable to the count of WRKY genes in Fagopyrum tataricum (78), and it is somewhat lower than those in S. lycopersicum L. (81), but much lower than those in O. sativa L. ssp. indica (102) and Glycine max (174). These findings corroborated previous research that suggested herbaceous plants tend to have a larger number of WRKY genes than woody plants.The variety of gene structures reflects the historical evidence of gene family evolution and serves as the foundation for phylogenetic categorization. Wheat and tea plants have 0–5 introns and 0–11 introns, respectively, whereas TsWRKYs have 2–12 introns, suggesting that TsWRKYs have abundant gene structural variation. The intron-exon distribution pattern is comparable across members of the same subfamily, which is the basis for functional similarity among members of the same evolutionary group. For example, the number of introns in almost all members of group III is 2. Furthermore, TsWRKYs from group I contain many more introns than other groups, which implies that it is more likely that other groups came from group I. Twenty conserved motifs were discovered in 78 TsWRKY proteins ( Figure 3 ), with motifs 1 and 2 belonging to the WRKY conserved domains. Partiular motifs that only arose in one group, such as motif 10 in group IIa and group IIb proteins and motif 8 in subgroup IId, which has yet to be characterized for some roles, should be given additional attention.According to a recent study, dicotyledons have experienced less evolutionary loss of the WRKY conserved domain than monocotyledons. This occurrence was validated in this investigation, with the majority of TsWRKYs having the conserved heptapeptid WRKYGQK motif, despite two TsWRKY genes having the variants WKKYGQK (TsWRKY33 and TsWRKY62, Group WKKY) ( Figure 1 ). The WRKY proteins demonstrate a propensity for binding to W-box elements, and WRKYGQK motif changes may affect DNA-binding interactions with downstream genes, as previously discovered. As a result, additional exploration of the functional and binding properties of these two WRKY proteins is required.How did the number of members of the WRKY family expand from 1 in the unicellular green algae to 78 in the T. sinensis? The analysis of segmental and tandem duplications contributed to revealing the number and function of the TsWRKY gene family. Based on the chromosome distribution and synlinearity analysis results of the TsWRKYs, 83 segmental duplication events within 72 TsWRKY genes were observed, while tandem duplication events existed. We found that 20 out of the 78 genes (25.6%) in this family are tandem repeats in T. sinensis, suggesting that the abundance of tandem repeats may be a possible reason for the larger number of TsWRKYs. In addition, whole-genome duplication (WGD) events often lead to the growth of gene families, which is common in the evolution of angiosperms. Previous study revealed that T. sinensis has a large number of gene duplications and that WGD events happened approximately 7.8 and 71.5 million years ago (Mya). We determined that, whereas some TsWRKY genes are the result of tandem duplication, segment duplication events are the driving force behind gene family evolution. The three basic evolutionary mechanisms are segmental duplication, tandem duplication, and transposition events like retroposition and replicative transposition. Individual gene duplication, chromosomal segment duplication, and even complete genome duplication supply the fresh materials required for gene generation. Gene duplication, which is associated with the generation of new gene functions, is one of the primary driving forces underlying genome evolution and also is essential to plant adaptive evolution. Tandem duplications produce highly diverse duplicates that have lineage-specific functions, and new research tea plants suggests that tandem duplication of genes plays an active part in flavor accumulation. Additionally, we speculated that the TsWRKY gene family may have been subjected to significant purifying selection forces throughout evolution because almost all TsWRKYs orthologous gene pairs had Ka/Ks<1. Divergence is a key feature of the evolution of paralogous homologous genes and DNA segments that make up fixed repeats. However, selection on copies of paralogous homologs would be relaxed in the case of full redundancy, which is when any number of functional copies of a gene give the same fitness. Therefore, this negative selection of TsWRKYs are associated with the post-fixation evolution of gene duplications.The main volatile aromatic compounds of T. sinensis are terpenes (isopentene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes), phenyl/phenylpropanes, and fatty acid derivatives. In T. sinensis, the terpenes have been demonstrated as the most important volatile compounds. The aroma of T. sinensis leaves is an important factor in determining its quality and an important criterion for measuring its economic value. During the germination and maturation process of T. sinensis tender buds, aromatic substances are gradually synthesized and accumulated. The results of real-time quantitative PCR revealed that 67.9 percent of TsWRKY had significantly varied transcript levels during the four stages of budding. Although little is known about the transcriptional regulatory network controlling terpenes synthesis, most of the identified regulators are WRKY TFs. It is reasonable to conclude that TsWRKYs expression patterns and the buildup of aromatic compounds are related. Therefore, we further analyzed the expression patterns of terpenoid synthase genes and detected that multiple genes of the MVA and MEP pathways are involved in regulating terpenoid accumulation. TsWRKYs showed a high correlation with the expression trends of 10 terpene synthesis genes. For example, TsFPPS, TsIDI, TsMTPS, TsWRKY9, TsWRKY24, and TsWRKY35 may coordinately regulate terpene synthesis. WRKY genes are essential regulators of secondary metabolite production in plants, while their regulatory functions varied substantially due to distinct binding mechanisms. Evidence suggests that certain WRKYs, alone or in concert with other transcription factors, govern the biosynthesis of valuable natural products. There have been several studies on the regulatory effects of WRKYs upon the activation or repression of genes involved in plant terpenoid production. Individual WRKY can be associated with a number of regulatory mechanisms, as SlWRKY73 transactivates the SlTPS3, SlTPS5, and SlTPS7 monoterpene synthase genes in tomato (S. lycopersicum). Gossypol (sesquiterpene phytoalexins) in Gossypium arboretum, DP (diterpenoid phytoalexin) in rice, Artemisinin (a type of sesquiterpene lactone) in Artemisia annua, ginsenosides (a group of triterpene) in Panax quinquefolius, and tanshinone (one category of bioactive diterpenes) in Salvia miltiorrhiza are all regulated by WRKYs. From correlative analysis in sweet Osmanthus fragrans, it is speculated that the OfWRKY gene participates in aroma synthesis by regulating the synthesis of monoterpene volatiles, and that the expression of OfWRKYs are closely related to monoterpene synthesis. Heterologous expression of WRKY and MYC2 in Salvia sclarea causes coactivation of MEP-biosynthetic genes and accumulation of abietane diterpenes. The co-expression network between several key genes for terpene biosynthesis and TsWRKYs provides important insights into the terpene biosynthesis pathway in T. sinensis. It helps to further characterize the functions of candidate WRKY gene families in T. sinensis and provide new ideas for agronomic genetic improvement and quality variety breeding.","The 78 proper TsWRKYs were discovered in this investigation. Segment duplication events are determined to be the driving force behind the expansion of the TsWRKYs gene family. TsWRKYs proteins may have been subjected to significant purifying selection forces throughout evolution. Several TsWRKYs that may be involved in regulating terpenoid accumulation in the MVA and MEP pathways were identified. In summary, our study provides comprehensive information on TsWRKYs and could facilitate further research into the functions of TsWRKYs in regulating the synthesis of volatile aromatic compounds and improving the aroma of edible leaves based on an understanding of the regulatory network."
90,TA039427,10.1292/jvms.24-0342,In vitro susceptibility testing of essential oils and their main componentsagainst antifungal-resistant Malassezia pachydermatis.,"Canine Malassezia dermatitis (CMD) and otitis externa are generally treated byantifungal drugs. However, azole-resistant strains have been isolated from canineskin and ear canals worldwide. Phytochemicals isolated from essential oils areeffective alternatives for inhibiting Malassezia pachydermatis. To evaluate theusefulness of phytochemicals against azole-resistant isolates, we performed invitro susceptibility testing using the phytochemicals carvacrol, citral, andthymol. Eight antifungal-resistant isolates were obtained from 7 cases ofdermatitis and 1 case of otitis externa during 2022 and 2023 from dogs in Tokyoand Kanagawa, Japan. Fungal susceptibility to carvacrol, citral, and thymol wereassessed using the modified broth microdilution method. The minimum inhibitoryconcentrations (MICs) of the phytochemicals in all isolates were as follows: 0.03to 0.125% for carvacrol; 0.03 to 0.125% for thymol; and 0.03% to 0.125% forcitral. Based on these results, carvacrol, citral, and thymol appear to beeffective against azole-resistant strains. The phytochemicals appear to beeffective for treating antifungal-resistant cases of CMD and otitis externa.","Nojo, Honoka, Murayama, Nobuo, Ishijima, Sanae A, Kano, Rui",2025,The Journal of veterinary medical science,2,False,False,True,"Canine Malassezia dermatitis (CMD) and otitis externa are generally treated by antifungal drugs, such as azoles that work by impairing the ability of fungi to produce ergosterol, an important component of the cell membrane. However, azole resistance has been reported in Malassezia pachydermatis strains isolated from canine skin and ear canals worldwide. Such resistant strains may make it more difficult to provide inexpensive treatments for CMD and otitis externa.Phytochemicals isolated from essential oils are effective alternatives for inhibiting microbial pathogens. The phytochemicals carvacrol, citral, and thymol are known to have antifungal activity against M. pachydermatis. If these substances can also inhibit the growth of antifungal-resistant strains, they may have great therapeutic value. Therefore, we performed in vitro susceptibility testing of antifungal-resistant M. pachydermatis strains, which were recently isolated from the skin and ear canals of Japanese pet dogs, to carvacrol, citral, and thymol.Eight antifungal-resistant isolates were obtained from 7 cases of dermatitis and 1 case of otitis externa in Tokyo and Kanagawa, Japan, during 2022 and 2023 (Table 1).For the sake of convenience, azole resistance was defined according to the previously reported 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of fluconazole (FLZ; >4 mg/L), itraconazole (ITZ; >0.5 mg/L), and miconazole (MCZ; >20 mg/L). The neotype strain of M. pachydermatis (CBS1879T) was used as a reference strain for which susceptibility values have already been reported (Table 1) [, ].Isolates were obtained by culturing skin swabs of canine skin and ear canals on modified Dixon medium (mDixon; 3.6% malt extract, 0.6% peptone, 2.0% desiccated ox bile, 1.0% Tween 40, 0.2% glycerol, 0.2% oleic acid, and 1.2% agar (pH 6.0)) at 32°C for 5 days.Yeast colonies were identified to be M. pachydermatis based on the sequence homology of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of the ribosomal DNA as described previously. The universal fungal primers ITS-5 (5′-GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3′) and ITS-4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) were used to amplify the ITS region of the isolates. Yeast cells (about 1 to 2 mg) from sub-cultures on mDixon were boiled in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-hydrochloride (Tris-HCl; pH 8.0), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). High-molecular-weight DNA was purified from the lysates by extraction with phenol followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting samples were suspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), and used as templates for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification.The DNA samples (100 to 200 ng each) were amplified by PCR in a volume of 30 μL; the reaction mixture contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 200 μM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1.0 unit of Taq polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), and 30 μmol of each primer pair. PCR amplification was carried out for 30 cycles as follows: denaturation for 30 sec at 94°C, primer annealing for 30 sec at 56°C, and extension for 60 sec at 72°C. A final extension step was performed at 72°C for 2 min. The amplicons were electrophoresed on an agarose gel, and an approximately 550-bp-long DNA band was excised from the gel, purified using the ExoSAP-IT® kit (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA), and sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3130 DNA Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) using the PCR primers for sequencing.Comparative nucleotide sequence analysis using the BLAST algorithm on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website showed that the ITS sequences amplified from all 8 isolates were 99% to 100% identical to those of the M. pachydermatis CBS 1879 ITS region from TYPE material (GenBank accession No. NR_126114). Therefore, all isolates were identified to be M. pachydermatis.Fungal susceptibility to carvacrol, citral, and thymol were assessed using the modified broth microdilution method. The phytochemicals and yeast solutions were mixed in Sabouraud’s dextrose liquid medium (1% peptone and 2% glucose) containing 1% Tween 80 (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The tested concentrations of the phytochemicals ranged from 0.001% to 0.5%. These phytochemicals were examined for antifungal activity at percent concentrations for future use as additives in shampoos and ear cleansers for dogs. Fungal susceptibility to azoles was also assessed using the modified broth microdilution method. The MIC value of the phytochemicals was defined as the lowest concentration (%) showing 80% growth inhibition.The MICs of the phytochemicals in all isolates were as follows: 0.03 to 0.125% for carvacrol; 0.03 to 0.125% for thymol; and 0.03% to 0.125% for citral (Table 1).Based on the in vitro susceptibility testing results, carvacrol, citral, and thymol appear to be effective against antifungal-resistant strains, and the tested concentrations of the phytochemicals (less than 0.5%) appear to be effective for the treatment of antifungal-resistant CMD and otitis externa. Since essential oils containing the phytochemicals used in this study have already been used for treating Malassezia otitis externa in dogs, and their efficacy and safety have been reported, the use of phytochemicals is also promising for the treatment of antifungal-resistant CMD and otitis externa. Because the content of active ingredients in natural essential oils can vary depending on the harvesting region and season, adding an industrially synthesized phytochemicals has the advantage of stability and lower cost. In this study, we investigated the anti-Malassezia activity by the three essential oil components, carvacrol, citral, and thymol. Comparing the MIC50 for each chemical, the MIC50 for citral was 0.06% and 0.125% for the other chemicals (Table 1). From this result, the citral was the most effective among the components. The citral is widely used as an aromatic agent in foods, cosmetics, and skin care products, and its safety is well accepted, so it is considered safe for use for canine skin and ears.",,,,
91,TA046930,10.1155/2020/8565760,Catharanthus roseus Combined with Ursolic Acid Attenuates Streptozotocin-InducedDiabetes through Insulin Secretion and Glycogen Storage.,"Catharanthus roseus (C. roseus) and ursolic acid (UA) are ayurvedic medicineswith multiple pharmacological activities including antidiabetic activity, buttill date, no study is available on their combination. This study documented theantidiabetic efficacy of the combination of C. roseus and UA in rats. Rats weredivided into six groups. All groups were given a single dose of Streptozotocin(STZ) at a dose of 50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal route for induction of diabetes,except the normal control group. Group 1 was treated as a normal control (NC)group and fed with saline water, Group 2 as a Diabetes Control group, Group 3 asa STZ+C. roseus ethanolic extract (CREE) group at 50 mg/kg p.o., Group 4 as aSTZ+UA group orally at 50 mg/kg, Group 5 as a STZ+CREE (25 mg/kg p.o.)+UA(25 mg/kg p.o.) group, and Group 6 as a STZ+Glimepiride (0.1 mg/kg) group.Diabetes was confirmed after 72 hours by estimation of blood glucose level, andthen treatment was given for the next 28 days. During the course of treatment,plasma insulin and blood glucose were measured regularly at the interval of 7days. At the end of the protocol, blood was collected and animals weresacrificed. The glucose level, insulin level, liver glycogen storage level, andantioxidant enzymes (LPO, CAT, SOD, GPx, GST) were measured. The blood glucoselevel in Group 5 significantly (P < 0.001) reduced to 98.35 ± 2.45 mg/dl incomparison with that in Group 2 (321.75 ± 5.46 mg/dl). The level of plasmainsulin in Group 5 increased (13.65 ± 0.10 μU/ml) significantly (P < 0.01) ascompared with that in Group 2 (05.93 ± 0.31 μU/ml). In Group 5, the level ofglycogen in liver was significantly (P < 0.01) increased as compared with that inGroup 2 rats. The level of antioxidant enzymes in Group 5 restored toward normalvalues significantly (P < 0.01; P < 0.001) as compared with that in Group 2animals. These findings suggest that low-dose combination of CREE and UA iseffective in the treatment of diabetes.","Alkreathy, Huda Mohammed, Ahmad, Aftab",2020,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2,False,False,True,"Diabetes is a metabolic disease which induced either due to the inability of pancreas to secrete sufficient insulin in body or when body is unable to use insulin effectively for the regulation of blood sugar. In both conditions, a large amount of sugar remains in blood. The increased sugar of blood is an identifying parameter for diabetes and this increased level for long time creates severe injury to multiple organ systems of the body. In year 2014, 8.5% of the adults suffered from diabetes. In year 2016, 1.6 million casualties were linked with diabetes. According to the 2011 Diabetes National Fact Sheet, around 8.3% people in the United States suffer from diabetes. Around 27% of the people already suffering from diabetes do not have knowledge that they have diabetes. The number of patient of diabetes increased more than 400% from year 1980 to 2014. Prevalence of diabetes increased mainly in undeveloped and developing countries, where income of the peoples is low. The diabetes is a main causative factor of kidney failure, blindness, stroke, heart attacks, and the amputation of limb. In year 2016, around 1.60 million casualties were associated with diabetes. Further, 2.20 million casualties were associated with the increased sugar level of blood in the year 2012. World Health Organization estimated that diabetes was the 7th major reason of casualty in the year 2016. This is estimated that approximately 425 million adults were suffering from diabetes in the year 2017 around the globe, as per the reports of the International Diabetes Federation. This is further postulated that the total prevalence of diabetic patients is expected to increase up to 629 million by the year 2045. Lifestyle management is an essential feature of diabetes care, which includes physical work, exercise, healthy food, psychosocial care, maintaining normal weight of body, and avoiding the use of tobacco can delay or prevent the induction of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Catharanthus roseus (C. roseus), popular with periwinkle synonym, is a flowering plant that belongs to the Apocynaceae family. In the ayurvedic system of medicine, its root and bark extract are used traditionally for the treatment of various kinds of diseases. In the Chinese alternative medicine system, decoction was utilized for the treatment of various disorders, which includes Hodgkin lymphoma, malaria, as well as diabetes. Previously, various alkaloids were extracted from this plant, of which vincristine and vinblastine got significant importance and utilized for the management of Hodgkin lymphoma and blood cancer.Ursolic acid (UA) is a very unique triterpenoid molecule present in medicinal plant, kingdom plantae, and utilized as an important part of the human food. Various recently studies reported the wide spectrum pharmacological potentials of UA. It exhibits a variety of effects including antimicrobial, anti-arthritic, and anticancer effects against variety of cancers. Numerous bioactivities of UA have been reported, but till date no clinical work available which demonstrates beneficial effects to human health care. In pre-clinical study, UA decreases the growth of many cancerous cells by inhibition of STAT-3 pathway in cell and also reduce cancerous cell proliferation by induction of apoptotic pathway. UA also inhibits JNK-expression and activation of IL-2 of JURKAT leukemia T-Cells which leads to the proliferation reduction and activation of T-Cell. As per previous work, UA is a weak inhibitor of aromatase enzyme, and it increases the brown fat and muscle amount and decreases the obesity of white fat and related conditions when present in fed of mice. UA under physiological concentrations also induces erythrocyte apoptosis (programmed cellular death of red blood cells). It also reduces the atrophy of muscle and enhances the growth of muscles in mice, which also exhibits significant cardio-protection activity. In animals, UA shows neuronal regeneration property after injury of nerve. UA is effective in the treatment of cognitive impairment in animals. UA is also used in the improvement of cognitive disorders by blockage of stress of endoplasm reticulum and nuclear factor-κB/IκB kinase β-mediated pro-inflammatory path in animals. UA improves lipopolysaccharide-induced cognition disorder in brain of mice by suppression of p38/NF-κB-inflammatory path. UA improves cognition impairment and modulates oxidative stress damage in mice brain induced by D galactose. UA improves regeneration of liver of mice after partial removal of part of liver. UA modulates cellular immunity and improve function of pancreas β-cell in diabetic high fat diet animals. It increases mass of skeletal muscle, exercise capacity, and griping strength. UA attenuates aging metabolic-phenotype by promotion of rejuvenation of skeletal muscle. Recently, a pharmacological and docking studies on the influence of UA on adjuvant-induced arthritis reported that Ocimum sanctum L leaf extract (rich in UA) loaded nanostructured lipid carriers inhibited the COX-1, COX-2, IL-1, and TNF-α; hence, ameliorate the arthritis in rats. Moreover, the in vitro anti-proliferative activities of some novel synthetic quinoline derivatives of UA bearing hydrazide, oxadiazole, or thiadiazole moieties against three cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HeLa, and SMMC-7721) have been recently reported. C. roseus and UA are ayurvedic medicines which possess numerous pharmacological activities including antidiabetic activity, but till date, no study is available on their combination against STZ-induced diabetes in rats. Based on the published literature, it was thought worthwhile to evaluate the antidiabetic activity of C. roseus ethanolic extract (CREE) alone, UA alone, and combination of both C. roseus ethanolic extract (CREE) and UA. Further, it gives the idea about the beneficial effect of low-dose combination of C. roseus ethanolic extract (CREE) and UA. In view of the above background, the current study was designed for evaluation of antidiabetic potential of combination of C. roseus ethanolic extract (CREE) and UA in STZ-induced diabetic rats.","Ursolic acid (UA) and Streptozotocin (STZ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company, St. Louis, (MO, USA). All other chemicals and solvents used in the study were of analytical grade and procured from an approved vendor. Standard pellet diet for animals was obtained from local supplier.Periwinkle leaves (C. roseus leaves) were collected from the gardens in the campus of King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, and was authenticated by one of the botanist at King Abdulaziz University. Leaves were dried in shadow by avoiding direct sunlight for several days. After drying, the leaves were crushed into a coarsely powdered state and 0.1 kg of powdered drug was mixed in petroleum-ether and left aside for two days for removing all chloroplast, wax, and fats. After this, it was filtrated and then suspended in 95% of 500 mL alcohol, and then extracted by using soxhlet apparatus for eighteen hours. After that, ethanol was evaporated by using rotary-evaporator at 40–44°C temperature. After significant evaporation, thick concentrated extract of ethanol was formed which was filtered by the use of a filter paper (coarse sieve). Then obtained filtrate was dried with reduced pressure and lastly it was lyophilized. This dried sample was used for experimentation purpose. The prepared C. roseus ethanolic extract (CREE) at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight was given orally, based on the previous published reports.Healthy male Wistar strain rats (5-6 months old) weighing 100-200 g were procured from the animal facility of King Fahad Medical Research Centre, King Abdulaziz University-Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This research study was carried out by adopting the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC) on the use and care of laboratory animals. The experimental rats were arbitrarily segregated into groups in different cages in standard set-controlled conditions. Before the commencement of the dosing, the rats were acclimatized in the animal room for seven days by maintaining a temperature of 25°C ± 2°C; relative humidity of 30-70%; and 12:12 h light/dark cycle. The rats were given free access to standard quality pallet diet and tap water ad libitum.STZ was be used for the induction of diabetes in rats. The animals were in fasting for sixteen hours before the diabetes induction. STZ was freshly prepared in the 0.05 M citrate buffer with value pH 4.5. A single dose of STZ (50 mg per kg, body weight) was administered to the rats by intraperitoneal injection to induce the diabetes. The diabetes induction was accessed by polyuria, polydipsia, and by the measurement of concentrations of blood glucose after 72 hours of administration of Streptozotocin and then treatment was given for next 28 days.Animals were acclimatized and allocated randomly in the six groups (n = 6) and rats were treated as per the following schedule for the period of 28 days. The body weights of the experimental rats were recorded using an electronic weighing balance before starting the treatments and at the termination of the protocol.Group 1 (normal control group): the rats were fed with normal saline (0.9%) and served as normal control (NC).Group 2 (Diabetes Control group): diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (50 mg/kg, body weight).Group 3 (CREE treated group): STZ+C. roseus ethanolic extract (CREE) at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight by oral route.Group 4 (UA treated group): STZ+UA (50 mg per kg, body weight) by oral route.Group 5 (CREE+UA treated group): STZ+CREE (25 mg per kg of body weight, orally)+UA (25 mg per kg of body weight, orally).Group 6 (Glimepiride-treated group): STZ+Standard Glimepiride (0.1 mg/kg, orally).At the end of protocol, the whole blood was withdrawn from the retro-orbital cavity of the animal in the light anesthesia. On the termination, blood was left aside to stand for thirty minutes at room temperature without anticoagulant. Then it was subjected to centrifuge for ten minutes at 2500 rpm to separate the serum at 4°C. The obtained serum was then held back at lower temperature (2-3°C) for further measurement of different biochemical study. Serum insulin and glucose levels were determined by enzymatic methods with the help of an automated analyzer (Dimension Vista® system, Siemens, Germany) using standard biochemical kits.The animals were euthanized by chloroform overdose, and their liver was isolated and washed in normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl solution in distilled water). The liver tissues were then perfused with 50 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4), which also contained EDTA (0.1 mmol/L), to drain the blood clots and cells. The part of the liver was homogenized in phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 7.4) and carefully centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, 15 minutes at 4°C. The clear supernatant was then used to assess antioxidant enzymes such as Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) by the method of Shivavedi et al., 2017.All the data was analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The data was expressed as Mean ± SEM. The significance among different groups was determined by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. P value of ∗P < .05, ∗∗P < .01, and ∗∗∗P < .001 were considered to be statistically significant, when compared with the control group.","The effect of the treatment on body weight in STZ-induced diabetic rats is represented by the graph in Figure 1. It can be clearly seen that the body weight of Group 2 at the end of the study was significantly decreased (P < 0.01) by 32% (136.86 g), whereas Group 1 had almost no change. On the other hand, between the groups receiving single drug treatment, Group 4 (179.64 g) showed better recuperation of body weight than Group 3 (174.56 g). Contrastingly, Group 5 had the best result (201.76 g) as it was administered the combinational therapy and the results were strikingly similar to that of the standard drug treatment Group 6. The body weight analysis outlines that the combinational treatment has promising results and hence potential antidiabetic activity may be evident.STZ-induced diabetic rats exhibited an increase in the level of blood glucose (P < 0.05); the glucose level peaked more than 3 times than that of Group 1 rats. Over the course of 4 weeks, on the treatment with single drugs, it was found that Group 3 and Group 4 treated with CREE and UA, respectively, had almost similar results where the blood glucose level lessened nearing the normal (Table 1). The decrease in the treatment group was significant as compared with Group 1 (P < 0.05 in all cases) and Group 2 (P < 0.05 in all cases). The combination treatment of rats in Group 5 with CREE and UA showed striking results as the blood glucose level (98.35 ± 2.45 mg/dl) in this group was below the normal rats (101.64 ± 2.82 mg/dl) at the end of the study. The result of Group 6 was considered the standard and hence it showed the best results in lowering the blood glucose level in rats (Table 1).Post STZ administration, on Day 0, the level of plasma insulin was found to be decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the rats of all groups (below 7.00 μU/ml) except Group 1 (15.65 ± 0.24 μU/ml) as evident from Table 2. At the end of the study, it was observed that the levels of plasma insulin were successfully restored in animals of group 3, 4, 5, and 6 significantly (P < 0.01 in all cases). Group 5 which received the combined treatment of CREE and UA showed best restoration of the plasma insulin (13.65 ± 0.10 μU/ml) in a significant manner.The effect of the treatments on liver glycogen storage level in STZ-induced diabetic rats is represented by the graph in Figure 2. Liver glycogen level was found to diminish in the rats administered with STZ, as in Group 2 it was found to decrease by more than 50% (34.34 mg/g tissue) as compared with Group 1 (73.55 mg/g tissue) (P < 0.01). On the administration of the combination of CREE and UA, the liver glycogen level was significantly restored (P < 0.01) in Group 5 (69.65 mg/g tissue) while the single treatment group receiving either CREE or UA showed noticeable elevation in the liver glycogen level (P < 0.01) in Group 3 and Group 4. The standard treatment Group 6 had almost normal level of liver glycogen.The effect of CREE and UA on the activities of GST, SOD, CAT, GPx, and LPO in STZ-induced diabetic rats is illustrated in Figure 3. In the rats treated with STZ, the activities of GST, CAT, GPx, and SOD were noticeably reduced (P < 0.01), whereas LPO was elevated significantly (P < 0.01) as compared with the disease control Group 2 rats (see Figure 3). In posttreatment with CREE and/or UA, the results were reversed, and remarkable restoration of the antioxidant enzyme was observed at the end of the study. In line with our study, plants possessing anti-hyperglycemic effects are used as potential sources for drug development worldwide. Medicinal plants containing flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, glycosides, etc. are often considered to possess anti-hyperglycemic activity.","Our study was aimed at investigating the antidiabetic activity of the combination of CREE and UA in STZ-induced diabetes in rats and also the evaluation of antioxidant capacity of these herbal extracts in order to establish scientific evidence for the use of CREE and UA in the treatment of diabetes. In our study, we deduced that anti-hyperglycemic action of the combination of CREE and UA was mediated by their antioxidant properties. C. roseus contain several biological substances like flavonoids, terpenoids, tannins, phenolics, and glycosides. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is resultant of structural and functional changes in the beta cells of pancreas and is characterized by the reduced insulin secretion. The elevated blood glucose and other biochemical deviations in the serum level are caused due to the deficiency of insulin or due to insulin resistance in target organs (IDF). Out of the several models available for the induction of diabetes, we used STZ model as per the facility available in our research laboratory. STZ is a derivative of nitrosourea and has been used in mimicking diabetes in rodents. STZ enhances the production of free radicals and the free radical scavenger system is inhibited, which gives rise to oxidative stress and finally damages pancreatic beta cells. The selective destruction of beta cells leads to deficiency in the serum levels of insulin consequently leading to hypoglycemic condition. In our study, we used a single dose of 50 mg/kg body weight of STZ for the induction of diabetic condition, following which the fasting blood glucose level elevated rapidly confirming the induction of diabetes in the rats under the study and it was also in confirmation of the previously reported studies.Hyperglycemia is characterized by signs of polydipsia, polyuria, and loss of body weight. The reduction in body weight is associated with proteolysis in the skeletal muscle and the degradation of fats induced by non-availability of energy via breakdown of carbohydrates. In this study, we found that the loss in body weight was noticeable in Group 2 rats, inferring a progressive proteolysis induced by the derangement of carbohydrate metabolism. The administration of combination of CREE and UA recuperated the body weight in Group 5 nearing to the normal and in congruence to the standard treatment Group 6. However, the restoration of body weight in the single treatment Group 3 and 4 was not that significant (Figure 1). The restoration of body weight showed that the treatment possibly worked in preventing muscle wasting by controlling the glycemic status.The decreased level of insulin in the diabetic animals was due to the destruction of the beta cells in pancreas. The treatment of the CREE and UA combination showed best efficacy in Group 5, which was in equivalence to the activity of the standard drug in Group 6 (Table 2). It is assumed that it might be due to the stimulation of beta cell to secrete insulin or it may also be possible due to the regeneration of beta cells of pancreas. Our results corroborate the previously reported research studies of similar kind.The synthesis of hepatic glycogen content is decreased due to diabetic condition, and it may be due to the low level of insulin in the body which inactivates glycogen synthase mechanism. The decrease in glycogen synthesis has been reported in several previously reported research articles. The restoration of hepatic glycogen content in Group 5 indicates that the combination of CREE and UA stimulates the glycogen synthase enzyme by boosting the insulin production from beta cells (Figure 2).Antioxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, GSH, and GPx play an important character in the prevention of damage caused by oxidative stress in the cells. SOD scavenges upon the radical of superoxide and changes it into hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, CAT reduces hydrogen peroxide into water molecule and hence protects the tissues from reactive hydroxyl radicals. GSH is also involved in the same process. When the level of SOD is increased unproportionally to GPx increase, there is an overload of peroxide that builds up inside the cell. In diabetic condition, elevated blood glucose can inactivate these antioxidant enzymes and hence an oxidative stress occurs which subsequently causes lipid peroxidation. The activities of SOD, CAT, GSH, and GPx was elevated and restored to normal while that of the LPO was reduced to normalize; this led to the attenuation of oxidative stress (Figure 3).","The present study concludes that CREE and UA showed potent hypoglycemic activity in STZ-induced diabetes in Wistar strain rats when compared with the normal rats. This combination treatment of CREE and UA is found and shown to enhance the efficacy and reduce the side effects. Significant improvement in body weight, levels of serum insulin, liver glycogen, and antioxidant enzymes activity were observed with best effect in the combined treatment group rather than the single drug treatment group. More detailed investigations are required to further strengthen these novel findings and further researches required in order to determine the specific mechanism of action of the antidiabetic effect."
92,TA042968,10.1016/j.phytol.2022.07.010,Synthesis and evaluation of diterpenic Mannich bases as antiviral agents againstinfluenza A and SARS-CoV-2.,"A chemical library was constructed based on the resin acids (abietic,dehydroabietic, and 12-formylabietic) and its diene adducts (maleopimaric andquinopimaric acid derivatives). The one-pot three-component CuCl-catalyzedaminomethylation of the abietane diterpenoid propargyl derivatives was carriedout by formaldehyde and secondary amines (diethylamine, pyrrolidine, morpholine,and homopiperazine). All compounds were tested for cytotoxicity and antiviralactivity against influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) in MDCK cells andSARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in BHK-21-hACE2 cells. Among 21 tested compounds, sixderivatives demonstrated a selectivity index (SI) higher than 10, and theirIC(50) values ranged from 0.19 to 5.0 μM. Moreover, two derivatives exhibitedpotent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity. The antiviral activity and toxicitystrongly depended on the nature of the diterpene core and heterocyclicsubstituent. Compounds 12 and 21 bearing pyrrolidine moieties demonstrated thehighest virus-inhibiting activity with SIs of 128.6 and 146.8, respectively, andappeared to be most effective when added at the time points 0-10 and 1-10 h ofthe viral life cycle. Molecular docking and dynamics modeling were adopted toinvestigate the binding mode of compound 12 into the binding pocket of influenzaA virus M2 protein. Compound 9 with a pyrrolidine group at C20 of17-formylabietic acid was a promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent with an EC(50) of10.97 µM and a good SI value > 18.2. Collectively, our data suggested the potencyof diterpenic Mannich bases as effective anti-influenza and anti-COVID-19compounds.","Tret'yakova, Elena V, Ma, Xinyuan, Kazakova, Oxana B, Shtro, Anna A, Petukhova, Galina D, Klabukov, Artem M, Dyatlov, Danil S, Smirnova, Anna A, Xu, Huan, Xiao, Sulong",2022,Phytochemistry letters,2,False,False,True,"The search for new antiviral agents is one of the priority areas of research in modern medicinal chemistry due to the spread of a wide range of viral infections and the emergence of new dangerous viral diseases caused by pathogenic strains, such as coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses, etc. For example, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in China at the end of 2019 has generated a global response and is a significant health challenge.An innovative approach to the development of new antiviral agents is the use of available plant metabolites as initial building blocks for the synthesis of libraries of derivatives and the study of the structure-antiviral activity relationship. Compounds of the terpene series are among the natural compounds that are promising for creating new antiviral agents. Natural terpenoids and their synthetic analogs are a promising source of new drugs for treating various diseases. These compounds are characterized by a massive variety of molecular structures, low toxicity, and the ability to affect several specific targets inside cells, which determines a wide range of their biological activity, including anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antiviral properties.Terpene compounds, in particular diterpene acids, are promising for the development of antiviral drugs based on them. Therefore, diterpene derivatives of the abietane series can help treat or prevent an influenza viral infection where the virus is an enveloped virus that undergoes hemagglutinin-mediated fusion with a host cell and/or the resultant symptoms. Dihydroquinopymaric acid amides and their 1β-succinyl and 1β-phthalyl derivatives containing amino acid residues show moderate activity against the reproduction of influenza virus A/FPV/Rostock/34 (H7N1), while quinopimaric acid derivatives with esters fragments are characterized by more pronounced antiviral properties against influenza A/California/07/09 (H1N1) with selectivity indices of 10 and greater. The conjugate with cinnamic acid shows the highest SI = 56.6. Dihydroquinopimaric acid is found to be moderately active against influenza virus type A (H1N1) (EC50 4.5; IC50 >100; SI >22), whereas its oxidized product is moderately active against influenza virus type A (H1N1 and H3N2) (EC50 3.2; IC50 >100; SI >31 and EC50 2.6; IC50 >100; SI >38) and papilloma virus HPV-11. An excellent antiviral activity of maleopimaric acid oxidized product and dihydroquinopimaric methyl-(2-methoxycarbonyl)ethylene amide is found toward HPV-11 with SIs 30 and 20, respectively. Methyl (2-methoxycarbonyl)ethylene-, 1-hydroxy-5′-kaprolaktamo- and 4-hydroxy-4,14α-epoxy-13(15)-ene-dihydroquinopimaric acid derivatives have also shown activity against replication of HCV nucleic acid low toxicity.Therefore, in the present study, we introduced heterocyclic moieties into the diterpene skeleton by Mannich reaction ( Fig. 1) and evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity and cytotoxicity of the target compounds against influenza virus A (H1N1) and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.","The synthetic protocols, spectral characteristics of compounds, and biological methods are described in Supporting Information.","The target compounds bearing a heterocyclic moiety were synthesized, as shown in Scheme 1. The starting 1a,4a-dehydroquinopimaric acid 1 was prepared from quinopimaric acid in two steps as previously described. For the synthesis of diterpene indole 5 with a morpholine fragment, primarily intermediate 2 was obtained as a result of the interaction of acid 1 with methylaminocrotonate by the Nenitzescu reaction, which was used in the further reaction. 1a, 4a-Dehydroquinopimaric acid propargylamide 3 was obtained by chloride method from acid 1 and propargylamine by heating in CH2Cl2 for 2 h. The maleopimaric acid propargylamide 4 was synthesized in a similar manner previously.Key compounds 5–7 were prepared by aminomethylation of indole 2 and alkynes 3, 4 with the secondary amines and the formaldehyde at room temperature in a 1,4-dioxane medium in the presence of CuCl catalyst (Scheme 1).The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed using various spectroscopic methods, including 1H and 13C NMR (see Supporting Information).Propargyl esters of abietic, 17-formylabietic, dehydroabietic, maleopimaric, and dihydroquinopimaric acids using Mannich reaction afforded compounds 8–25 holding diethylamine, pyrrolidine, and morpholine fragments as previously described ( Fig. 2).The prepared compounds 5–25 were evaluated for their in vitro antiviral activity against the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus (for MDCK cells). Oseltamivir carboxylate was used as a reference compound. The resulting data were expressed as virus-inhibiting activity (IC50), cytotoxicity (CC50), as well as selectivity index (SI), which is the ratio CC50/IC50, and presented in Table 1. Compounds with SIs greater than 10 were considered active.Among 21 tested compounds, six of them were considered as prospective with SIs higher than 10 and IC50 values from 0.19 to 5.0 μM. Analysis of the obtained data demonstrated that the antiviral activity against influenza virus A H1N1 depended on the nature of the heterocyclic moiety and the type of diterpene scaffold. Therefore, the Mannich bases obtained based on diterpene indole, as well as abietic and dehydroabietic acids 7, 8–10, and 14–16 showed a moderate inhibitory activity (IC50 89–12.6 μM) and relatively high toxicity against cells (CC50 140–7.9 μM), which was expressed by the low values of the SI. Similar results were obtained for aminoalkylated analogs of 17-formylabietic, maleopimaric, and dihydroquinopimaric acids as well as methyl 1β,4α-dihydroxydihydroquinopimarate containing morpholine and diethylamine moieties 13, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25 (IC50 37.4–5.48 μM, CC50 92–19.8 μM, SI 5.45–0.49) except for compound 11, which showed low toxicity but weak antiviral activity (IC50 72.6 μM, CC50 718 μM, SI 9.89).At the same time, diterpene Mannich bases with homopiperazine and pyrrolidine moieties 5, 6, 12, 18, 21, and 24 had SIs more than 10. Consequently, they can be recognized as perspective compounds. Among them, the 1a,4a-dehydroquinopimaric acid homopiperazine derivative 6, as well as the methyl 1β,4α-dihydroxyquinopimarate pyrrolidine derivative 24, showed high antiviral activity, exceeding the activity of the reference drug by 34 and 25 times, respectively, but exhibited high toxicity. For the maleopimaric acid Mannich bases with homopiperazine 5 and pyrrolidine fragments 18, antiviral activity was two times higher than the activity of oseltamivir, and the toxicity compared with the above compounds was decreased. Compounds 12 and 21 with the pyrrolidine fragment were the most effective against the influenza virus. The dihydroquinopimaric acid analog 21 with SI 146.8 was 13-fold more active than oseltamivir (IC50 0.47 μM) but still showed relatively high cytotoxicity (CC50 69 μM). Finally, 17-formylabietic acid derivative 12 exhibited potent viral inhibitory activity and low toxicity, indicating a high therapeutic index (SI 128.6) compared with the reference drug.We performed time-of-addition experiments to determine the suggestive target for the virus-inhibiting activity of the most active compounds in the virus life cycle (Fig. S5, Supporting Information). As suggested from the data, compounds 12 and 21 showed the greatest activity when added at time points 0–10 and 1–10, but not (−1)− 10. These results indicated that a possible target for compounds might be the viral entry into the cell, uncoating, and the early stages of replication, but not the binding of the virus to the receptor.Therefore, the possible target of the compounds might be M2-protein or (less likely) HA-protein or NP. Moreover, it was impossible to exclude cellular proteins involved in endocytosis.We investigated the binding mode of compound 12 into the binding pocket of influenza A virus M2 protein (PDB code: 6BKL) by docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The Schrödinger program (version 2018) was employed, and the docked conformation of compound 12 was determined based on the minimum free energy analyses. According to the computer-aided docking data, compound 12 occupied the M2 proton channel formed by four adjacent subunits with an estimated binding energy of − 5.47 kcal/mol. Subsequently, we performed a 20.0-ns molecular dynamics simulation on the docking structure. The results showed that compound 12 matched better to the binding site (Fig. S6, Supporting Information).HIS37 of subunit C formed a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl of compound 12, and SER31 of subunit D also formed a hydrogen bond with another hydroxyl. In addition, multiple hydrophobic interactions were observed between ligand and protein, namely residues VAL27, VAL28, ALA30, ILE32, ILE 33 of subunit A, VAL27, ALA30, ILE 33 of subunit B, VAL27, ALA30, ILE 33 of subunit C, and LEU26, VAL27, ALA30, ILE 35 of subunit D. Many van der Waals contacts were also observed (Fig. S7, Supporting Information).To explore the spectrum of antiviral activity, we further assessed the anti-SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus activity of compounds 5–25 in BHK-21-hACE2 cells, and the primary screening results are summarized in Table 2. In addition, amodiaquine, an effective inhibitor of viral entry of SARS-CoV-2, was utilized as the positive control. Among the 21 tested compounds, four of them (6, 11, 18, and 22) showed a certain degree of cytotoxicity to BHK-21-hACE2 cells at a concentration of 20 μM with cell viability less than 50% and were not evaluated for inhibition of viral replication. Regarding the anti-antiviral effect, when BHK-21-hACE2 cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and cultured in the presence of 20 µM compounds 9, 15, and 24, there was a significant reduction in the number of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus-infected cells.Two compounds 9 and 15 showed significant antiviral activity with an inhibition rate over 60% at 20 μM and were selected for the dose-response assays ( Fig. 3). Of particular note, compound 9 showed a higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus activity (EC50 10.97 µM) and lower cytotoxicity (CC50 > 200 µM) compared with compound 15.",,"In summary, we developed a practical approach to the novel abietane derivatives with high antiviral potency. The method was based on the three-component CuCl-catalyzed reaction of diterpene acetylenes with formaldehyde and secondary amines to form Mannich bases. Minimal toxicity with the highest antiviral activity against influenza virus A was demonstrated by compound 12 bearing a pyrrolidine fragment. The compound 12 appeared to be most effective when added at the time points 0–10 and 1–10 h of the viral life cycle, and the possible target was M2-protein. Molecular docking and dynamics modeling investigated the binding mode of compound 12 into the binding pocket of influenza A virus M2 protein. The in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in BHK-21-hACE2 cells revealed that compound 9 could effectively inhibit pseudovirus replication with no apparent toxicity."
93,TA042074,10.3390/ijms242216322,In Vitro Cytotoxic Effects of Ferruginol Analogues in Sk-MEL28 Human MelanomaCells.,"Ferruginol is a promising abietane-type antitumor diterpene able to induceapoptosis in SK-Mel-28 human malignant melanoma. We aim to increase this activityby testing the effect of a small library of ferruginol analogues. After ascreening of their antiproliferative activity (SRB staining, 48 h) on SK-Mel-28cells the analogue 18-aminoferruginol (GI50 ≈ 10 µM) was further selected formechanistic studies including induction of apoptosis (DAPI staining, p < 0.001),changes in cell morphology associated with the treatment (cell shrinkage andmembrane blebbing), induction of caspase-3/7 activity (2.5 at 48 h, 6.5 at 72 h;p < 0.0001), changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (not significant)and in vitro effects on cell migration and cell invasion (Transwell assays, notsignificant). The results were compared to those of the parent molecule(ferruginol, GI50 ≈ 50 µM, depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane p < 0.01 at72 h; no caspases 3/7 activation) and paclitaxel (GI50 ≈ 10 nM; caspases 3/7activation p < 0.0001) as a reference drug. Computational studies of theantiproliferative activity of 18-aminoferruginol show a consistent improvement inthe activity over ferruginol across a vast majority of cancer cells in the NCI60panel. In conclusion, we demonstrate here that the derivatisation of ferruginolinto 18-aminoferruginol increases its antiproliferative activity five times inSK-MEL-28 cells and changes the apoptotic mechanism of its parent molecule,ferruginol.","Shao, Luying, González-Cardenete, Miguel A, Prieto-Garcia, Jose M",2023,International journal of molecular sciences,2,False,False,True,"Natural products are a continuous source of cytotoxic compounds that lead to cancer treatment. Malignant melanoma, the most aggressive skin cancer, accounts for about 3% of malignant tumour cases. Its incidence is rising worldwide, becoming resistant to therapeutic agents.Our recent review highlighted the therapeutic potential of diterpenes against melanoma. This class of phytochemicals exhibits high structural diversity and potent biological activities due to their unique carbon skeletons. They have traditionally been a source for developing new anticancer agents. Taxol, the first “blockbuster diterpene,” was initially selected for its activity on murine melanoma cells. The most recent discovery in this class of metabolites is ingenol mebutate, indicated for the chemoprevention of melanoma in patients with actinic keratosis.Abietane-type diterpenes, characterised by a tricyclic ring system, include some compounds that show significant cytotoxicity against melanoma cells. We have extensively reviewed their chemistry and biology in a previous work. Examples include carnosol and carnosic acid, two well-known phenolic diterpenes from Rosmarinus officinalis L. extracts, and other lesser-known diterpenes such as Parvifloron D from Plectranthus ecklonii Benth, 11,12,16-trihydroxy-2-oxo-5-methyl-10-demethyl-abieta-1[10],6,8,11,13-pentene from Premna serratifolia L. and 7a-acetoxyroyleanone and horminone from roots of Peltodon longipes A. St. Hill. Ex Benth. All these plants belong to the same botanical family (Lamiaceae). Another abundant source of these diterpenes is the rosin from coniferous species such as pine trees. Abietic acid and dehydroabietic acid, the primary diterpenic acids found in Pinus rosin, have potential as anticancer agents. They have demonstrated significant growth inhibitory activity against various human cancer cells, including breast, ovary, prostate, colon, liver, lung and cervix lines.Ferruginol (1, Figure 1), another promising abietane-type antitumor diterpene with a characteristic phenolic ring, is found in the Lamiaceae and Cupressaceae families. It has shown significant cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, including gastric, prostate, lung, cervical, breast and colon cancer cells, leukaemia and melanoma cells in vitro. When administered intraperitoneally, it inhibited tumour growth in mice CL1-5 xenografts. Sugiol, the C7-oxidized derivative of ferruginol (11, Figure 1), has also demonstrated in vitro cytotoxic activity against human pancreatic and melanoma tumour cell models and in vivo antitumor properties in a prostate DU145 mouse xenograft model. Ferruginol induces apoptosis in SK-Mel-28 human malignant melanoma cells using P-p38 and NF-κB mediation. These antecedents prompted the creation of a library of semisynthetic ferruginol derivatives (Figure 1) by one of the authors (M. Gonzalez-Cardenete) and their collaborative screening against a panel of representative human cancer cells (SUM149, MDA-MB231, T47D and MCF07A549, HBL-100, HeLa, SW1573, T-47D, WiDr, NALM-06, KOPN-8, SUP-B15, UoCB1 and BCR-ABL), and also parasites (Leishmania sp.) and viruses (Zika, Dengue, Herpes simplex type 1 and Chikungunya) with promising results.In light of the above-discussed precedents, we aim to expand our understanding of the effect of a library of ferruginol analogues (Figure 1) on human SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells.","Ferruginol and synthetic analogues (Figure 1) were synthesised as described previously by one of the authors (M. Gonzalez-Cardenete): compounds 1 and 2 and compounds 3–11. The characterisation data for all tested compounds were in excellent agreement with those reported by us and similar purity, above 95% (NMR data are available on request). All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) Sulforhodamine B, trichloroacetic acid, Trizma base, propidium iodide, Ribonuclease A, formaldehyde and crystal violet. Glacial acetic acid, ethanol and methanol were from Fisher (Leicestershire, UK). Minimum essential media (MEM), heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin–streptomycin antibiotic, non-essential amino acids solution (NEAA), sodium pyruvate, TrypLE Express (1×, trypsin, EDTA, phenol red), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), ReadyProbes® cell viability imaging kit, trypan blue and the MitoProbe JC-1 kit were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Matrigel was from BD Bioscience (San Jose, CA, USA), Caspase-Glo® 3/7 from Promega and DAPI staining from Cell Signalling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). CytoSelect Cell Migration Assay kit was from Cell Biolab Inc (San Diego, CA, USA).SK-MEL-28 cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and was maintained in MEM containing GlutaMAx and supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% NEEA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1% penicillin–streptomycin antibiotic all from Gibco (Waltham, MA, USA) under a humidified atmosphere (Air 5% CO2) and at 37 °C.This assay determined the ability of the extract to inhibit cellular growth by measuring the cell density, thereby estimating cell number. This assay was performed according to previously described methods. Cells were seeded at a density of 8000 cells/well in a 96-well plate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and left overnight to attach at 37 °C. Afterwards, cells were treated with ferruginol and its derivatives for 48 h. Upon the completion of the incubation period, the cells were fixed with a trichloroacetic acid solution for one hour at 4 °C. After washing with water, the cell proteins were stained with SRB solution and left at room temperature for one hour. Then, the plate was washed four times with 1% acetic acid and flicked to remove unbound dye. Then, Tris base buffer solution was added to each well, and the absorbance was measured at 510 nm. Cell growth was calculated using the following equation:The selectivity index (SI) has been calculated as indicated by Indrayanto, Putra and Suhud:The apoptosis induced using compounds was determined by measuring the activity of caspase-3/7 using Caspase-Glo® 3/ according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). SK-MEL-28 cells were seeded in a 96-well white plate and treated with compounds or DMSO for different time points (12, 24 and 48 h). Afterwards, 100 μL of culture media of each well was transferred to a 96 white multi-well plate, and 100 μL of Caspase-Glo® 3/7 reagent was added and incubated for one hour at room temperature. When the incubation period was completed, the luminescence of each sample representing the enzymatic activity of caspase was measured using a plate-reading luminometer (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). The assay was performed in three independent experiments, and each sample was performed in triplicate (mean ± SD, n = 9).A morphological assessment of the cells was performed to detect the cellular changes induced using the tested compounds according to a previously reported method. Cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells in 12-well plates with or without compounds/DMSO for 48 h. Treated cells with typical morphological changes of apoptosis were imaged using a phase-contrast inverted microscope (EVOS cell imaging system, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cells were treated in the same condition and examined with a fluorescence microscope using DAPI staining dye (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). The dyes were added and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the wells were visualised using the EVOS cell imaging system. The quantitative results were obtained by capturing images from six random fields for each sample using three pictures per replicate. The fragmented nuclei were then calculated using the open-access software ImageJ v. 1.53k (National Institute of Health, LOCI, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA).The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) was determined using the fluorescent probe JC-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). One thousand cells/well (6, 12 and 24 h) and five thousand cells/well (72 h) were seeded into 96 well, black plates with transparent bottoms and incubated. After incubation, the treated cells were washed with the warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice, JC-1 (2 μM, dye) and CCCP (50 μM, positive control) were added and further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The fluorescence-stained cells were measured by a fluorescence plate reader (Tecan Infinite M200, Männedorf, Switzerland) with red fluorescence in excitation (550 nm)/emission (600 nm) and green fluorescence in excitation (485 nm)/emission (535 nm). Cell migration was measured using the CytoSelect Cell Migration Assay kit (CBA-100-C, Cell Biolab Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA). Polycarbonate filters with 8-µm pore size inserts were placed in a 24-well plate. To assess invasion, the polycarbonate filters with 8-µm pore size inserts coated with a protein matrix isolated from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumour cells to form a membrane layer. The coated inserts required rehydration with 300 µL warm, serum-free medium before cell seeding. To assess migration, the polycarbonate filters were not coated. SK-MEL28 cells were seeded in a serum-free medium with testing drugs onto the inserts, and the lower chambers were filled with the same serum medium containing drugs and incubated for 24 h and 48 h. Later, the remaining cells were gently removed using a cotton swab, and the inserts were washed and fixed with cold methanol. Then, the migrated cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 10 min, and then inserts were washed with PBS and let air dry. Air-dried inserts were dissolved in 10% acetic acid to obtain a coloured solution. The number of the cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter was measured at 560 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Tecan Infinite® M200, Männedorf, Switzerland) and presented as relative absorbance compared to control (mean ± SD) from three independent experiments.Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments. All data were analysed using One-way ANOVA and unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test with a p-value of <0.05 considered significant to find the statistical significance between treated groups and controls using InStat v.3 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).The DRUDIT online 1.0 (STEBICEF-University of Palermo, Italy) service runs on four servers that are automatically selected according to the number of jobs and online availability. Each server can support up to 10 simultaneous jobs while the exceeding jobs are placed in a queue. DRUDIT consists of several software modules implemented in C and JAVA and running on MacOS Mojave. The input structures were drawn directly in the web interface. The MOLDESTO (molecular descriptor tool), implemented in DRUDIT, calculates more than 1000 molecular descriptors (1D, 2D and 3D) for each input structure.The MOLDESTO file for each molecule is then submitted to the AAP tool as described by the authors. It comprises the fingerprint (FP) and cell line (CL) modules, which cooperate simultaneously to assign the predicted −logGI50 values to each input structure. In each module, the performed calculation is dynamic; indeed, it can be modulated by appropriately tuning the values of the available parameters. The FP module parameters are a choice of biological activity, such as GI50, TGI, LC50, or G%, but in this work, only the first one was considered. The N (-b), the best number of the dynamically selected molecular descriptors; Z (-m), the number of descriptors for which |v − m|/m < <value> applies (v: descriptor value, m: target mean) were set at ½ Max value to allow for an equal bias to all cells in the panel and the Gaussian smoothing function used was set in “c mode”.","Cell proliferation is a critical step in determining the effectiveness of cytotoxic small molecules. We here chose the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) staining assay, developed and utilised by the US National Cancer Institute, as it is considered the gold standard for this screening method.Figure 2 presents the 50% growth inhibitory concentration (GI50, µM) of all ferruginol analogues tested on SK-MEL-28 cells in the SRB assay for 48 h. In our experiments, we used paclitaxel as a positive reference. Its GI50 was approximately 10 nM, an order of magnitude lower than the ferruginol derivatives.The results indicate that the introduction of an amino group in position 18 is the only chemical modification that enhances the antiproliferative activity of (+)-ferruginol (1) (GI50 = 47.5 µM). This modification results in a compound (2), termed 18-aminoferruginol, which exhibits approximately five times greater activity (GI50 = 9.8 µM). This activity is not significantly different from paclitaxel, the reference drug used in this study. Figure 3 illustrates the range of their antiproliferative effects.These results must be compared with the antiproliferative effects of ferruginol and 18-aminoferruginol in normal cells. Fibroblasts are normal human foreskin cells utilised to test for general cytotoxicity. These cells are typically sensitive to compounds that induce necrosis or apoptosis and serve to calculate a selectivity index (Table 1). The results show a more favourable cytotoxicity profile for 18-aminoferruginol when compared to its parent molecule, ferruginol.To understand the antiproliferative activity of 18-Aminoferruginol, we evaluated cell viability and apoptosis qualitatively (Figure 4) and quantitatively (Figure 5). We used phase contrast microscopy (Figure 4, right column) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Figure 4, left column) staining to confirm the cytotoxicity of the compounds to melanoma cells. Phase contrast images (Figure 5, left column) reveal that untreated cells grew to near confluence and spread regularly on the slide. Treated cells exhibited several apoptotic features, such as cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing over the incubation period.After 48 h of exposure treatments, the percentage of blue-stained cells decreased compared to the control. We quantitatively evaluated the images by counting the total number of nuclei and normalising them to untreated controls. We also counted the total number of fragmented nuclei. This decrease indicates that both compounds promoted cell death (Figure 5). The extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways converge at the activation of caspase-3. The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is known to precede apoptosis and chemical hypoxia-induced necrosis. To understand the mechanisms behind the apoptotic features observed in our microscopy studies, we examined the effects of ferruginol and 18-aminoferruginol on mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 6) and caspase-3/7 activity (Figure 7), which serve as markers for early and late phase apoptosis, respectively.Ferruginol (10 µM) caused depolarisation of mitochondrial membranes after a 24 h treatment, an effect that persisted up to 72 h. However, this did not lead to significant activation of caspases 3/7 after three days of treatment. The reference compound CCCP (2 µM) consistently depolarised SK-MEL-28 cells from 6 h onwards, confirming the model’s sensitivity to this effect.In contrast, 18-aminoferruginol (10 µM) did not cause depolarisation of the mitochondrial membranes. Unlike ferruginol, it promoted caspase-3/7 activity at all time points (12, 24 and 48 h), similar to the effects of the reference drug paclitaxel (10 nM).While chemotherapy drugs typically target cancer cell viability, this does not prevent the metastasis of surviving cancer cells. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether cytotoxic agents can also inhibit cancer cell motility, a key factor for success in advanced stages of cancer.Cell motility encompasses two distinct concepts in experimental biology: migration and invasion. Migration refers to the directed movement of cells on a substrate, such as basal membranes, extracellular matrix (ECM) fibres, or plastic plates. In contrast, invasion involves the movement of cells through a 3D matrix, requiring a more complex set of cellular processes that include restructuring the surrounding 3D environment.The ability to migrate is a prerequisite for invasion; a cell can migrate without invading but not without migrating. Several cell migration assays are available to evaluate the anti-metastatic activity of drugs, including 2D assays (such as wound healing/scratch assays) and 3D assays (such as transwell assays and Boyden chamber assays).Our results with antiproliferative concentrations of either ferruginol and its derivative compound 2 (18-aminoferruginol) show that they reduced the motility, although in a non-significant manner. (Figure 8). In our study, we conducted an in vitro migration assay using plain transwell assays and then coated them with an appropriate matrix to simulate cell migration/invasion (refer to Section 4.7 for details). These protocols, together with the study of proliferation using the SRB staining technique, are considered conventional label-based endpoint methods of choice. However, they compromise in two aspects: real-time monitoring and a realistic 3D environment. This may contribute to experimental variation and challenges in identifying and validating new cancer drug targets using these cellular assays. There is a possibility that with improved techniques, such as 3D-microfluidics using a wider range of concentrations (MNTC to GI50), the errors may be reduced and significance reached.","We can deduce the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of compounds 1–11 (Figure 1) from the data obtained in the SK-MEL-28 cell line (Figure 2). Most compounds exhibited less activity than the parent molecule, with only compounds 1, 2 and 5 showing moderate activity. Compound 2 (18-aminoferruginol) was the most potent.Acetylation on the hydroxyl group at C-12 produced more potent compounds (3 and 5 vs. 4 and 8). However, oxygenation at C-7 to produce ketone analogues of sugiol (11) and methyl ester or carboxylic acid at C-18, such as compounds 8 and 9, led to inactive compounds. Our previous study showed a similar trend with leukaemia cell lines.These abietane-diterpenoid derivatives are promising sources of bioactive molecules with interesting pharmacological and drug-like properties. Table 2 data show that despite half of the compounds violating Lipinski’s rule of Log p < 5, some compounds like ferruginol (1), methyl 12-acetoxy dehydroabietate (3), 18-hydroxyferruginol (7) and sugiol (11) exhibit moderate activity. In contrast, some compounds that comply with Lipinski’s rule, such as methyl 18-carboxy sugiol (8) and 18-carboxy sugiol (9), show no activity. The most active analogue, 18-aminoferruginol (2), complies with Lipinski rules and reveals an increased polar surface area and decreased lipophilicity, which increases its drug-likeness and—according to expectations—is here associated with much lower GI50 values. It is important, however, to keep in mind that although increasing lipophilicity is considered to be an advantage in experimental models as it favours a passive entrance to the cell via diffusion through the membranes, it does not always translate well into favourable clinical parameters.A mitochondrial permeability transition event usually indicates cellular apoptosis initiation, while caspase 3/7 activation signals the late apoptosis phase. Ferruginol induces apoptosis in several melanoma cell lines, including SK-MEL-28. In our study, ferruginol triggered early depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane in SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells, but this did not lead to caspase 3/7 activation. Only its 18-amino derivative activates caspases at later time points. Conversely, 18-aminoferruginol did not replicate its parent molecule’s depolarising effect on mitochondrial membranes but activated caspases as effectively as the reference drug paclitaxel. This seemingly counterintuitive effect aligns with emerging data suggesting that dissipation of Δψm may or may not be an early event in the apoptotic pathway, depending on the cell system under investigation and the apoptotic stimuli used.The relationship between caspases and mitochondrial membrane potential is an evolving paradigm. Single-cell imaging experiments have demonstrated that the mitochondrial membrane potential depolarises after or concurrently with the release of a cyt-C-GFP fusion protein, a process described as caspase-dependent. In addition to apoptosis, emerging data suggest a direct link between mitochondria and caspases in regulating non-apoptotic processes such as mitochondrial dynamics, autophagy, mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation, immune responses and differentiation. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL significantly regulate intrinsic apoptosis by protecting the mitochondrion. Previous studies on abietane diterpene derivatives have shown that even overexpression of these protective proteins does not confer resistance to abietane diterpene-induced cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines. Future research should explore the effects of such compounds on apoptosis resistance factors like Smac/DIABLO and AIF.The anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of abietane diterpenoids appear to be poorly defined. Previous research reports that abietic acid exhibits such effects in non-human B16 melanoma cells at similar concentrations, while tanshinone II reduces CXCL12-induced human melanoma A375 cell invasive ability and migration in a dose-dependent manner. However, in our experiments, ferruginol and its derivatives did not significantly affect SK-MEL-28 cell movement in transwell models at 10 µM. Therefore, more efforts are needed to screen additional abietane diterpenes to determine their potential to inhibit cancer cell motility.The effects of semisynthetic ferruginol and some selected analogues, including 18-aminoferruginol, have also been tested by one of the authors in four breast cancer cell lines, namely SUM149, MDA-MB231, T47D and MCF-7. Then, again, 18-aminoferruginol consistently showed better cytotoxicity than its parent molecule while keeping low cytotoxicity towards the non-tumorigenic cell line BJ. A selective effect is considered a crucial parameter for effective cancer treatment to exert high antitumor activity and minimal toxicity to normal tissues. Therefore, it is considered a good indicator of reduced side effects. Notably, a ferruginol analogue containing a phthalimide group at C18 also showed increased antiproliferative activity and a selectivity index similar to 18-aminoferruginol. Further research is needed to understand the exact nature of the improvement due to adding the amino group at C-18. This finding aligns with previous studies using slightly different parent abietane templates. For instance, dehydroabietylamine—also called leelamine—proved to be a better antitumor agent than its parent molecule, dehydroabietic acid. It has the same amino group in position 18 and targets multiple key signalling pathways in melanoma cells, including uncommon ones such as cancer cell death via inhibiting intracellular cholesterol transport. This data prompted the synthesis of further derivatives—such as abietylamine—to improve these bioactivities and protect intellectual property. A significant difference between these derivatives and ferruginol is the absence of the phenol group. In our study, we have retained it as an integral part of the pharmacophore moiety or the privileged structure that we are examining in the parent ferruginol.These data and the above considerations for leelamine indicate that the derivatisation of abietane diterpenes in C18 is a promising way to find new, improved anticancer lead compounds. We, therefore, employed the Antiproliferative Activity Predictor (AAP) tool to calculate the GI50 values of 18-aminoferruginol and its parent molecule against the NCI60 panel. This ligand-based protocol has proven highly reliable and robust, making it particularly suitable for predicting activity against the SK-MEL-28 cell line. It also uses data based on the same antiproliferative test we chose. Figure 9 shows the predicted results for ferruginol and 18-aminoferruginol (−logGI50), with values between 4 and 6 considered more reliable.The overall data reveal an improvement in ferruginol’s antiproliferative activity after amination at position 18 across most cells in the panel. Exceptions include T-47D (breast cancer), HT29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) and HOP-62 (lung adenocarcinoma). In the first case, Gonzalez-Cardenete and coworkers showed that 18-aminoferruginol is not significantly more active (>50 µM) in the CellTitre® assay than ferruginol (>100 µM), but both were considered inactive against this cell line.The predicted MCF-7 (breast cancer) values align with our previous MTT test values: ferruginol 19 µM vs. 18-aminoferruginol 10 µM. It is noteworthy that similar values for M19-MEL are due to a known limitation of the AAP for this particular cell line. For all other melanoma cells, the improvement in activity for 18-aminoferruginol was more evident across all SK-Mel cell lines.Our findings demonstrate that converting ferruginol into 18-aminoferruginol increases its antiproliferative activity fivefold in SK-MEL-28 cells. It also alters the apoptotic mechanism to activate caspases 3/7 without prior mitochondrial membrane depolarisation. In silico predictions align with experimental data, showing that 18-aminoferruginol is more cytotoxic to a panel of 60 cancer cells than its parent molecule. These findings encourage future broader applications.In summary, we demonstrate here that the derivatisation of ferruginol into 18-aminoferruginol increases its antiproliferative activity five times in SK-MEL-28 cells as well as changing the apoptotic mechanism to activation of caspases 3/7 without previous depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane. In silico predictions agree with experimental data in that 18-aminoferruginol is more cytotoxic to a panel of 60 cancer cells than its parent molecule, thus encouraging future broader applications. These data—and the previous reports for non-phenolic abietanes such as leelamine—suggest that derivatisation of abietane diterpenes at C18 could be a promising approach to discovering new, improved cytotoxic lead compounds.",

Br.","Four previously undescribed highly oxygenated diterpenoids (1-4),zeylleucapenoids A-D, characterized by halimane and labdane skeletons, wereisolated from the aerial parts of Leucas zeylanica. Their structures wereelucidated primarily via NMR experiments. The absolute configuration of 1 wasestablished using theoretical ECD calculations and X-ray crystallographicanalysis, whereas those for 2-4 were assigned using theoretical ORD calculations.Zeylleucapenoids A-D were tested for anti-inflammatory activity against nitricoxide (NO) production in RAW264.7 macrophages, of which only 4 showed significantefficacy with an IC(50) value of 38.45 μM. Further, active compound 4 was alsoevaluated for the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-αand IL-6 and was found to have a dose-dependent inhibitory effect, while itshowed nontoxic activity for zebrafish embryos. A subsequent Western blottingexperiment revealed that 4 inhibited the expression of inducible nitric oxidesynthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Furthermore, molecular dockinganalysis indicated that the possible mechanism of action for 4 may be bind totargets via hydrogen and hydrophobic bond interactions.","Zhao, Ting, Zhang, Xuan, Nong, Xu-Hua, Zhou, Xue-Ming, Chai, Ru-Ru, Li, Xiao-Bao, Chen, Guang-Ying",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"Inflammation has been closely related to the immune defense response of patients with chronic diseases. The discovery of new anti-inflammatory agents gave hope for the treatment of inflammation-linked diseases, such as metabolic syndromes, autoimmune diseases, and so on. Medicinal plants were an important source for the development of lead drugs. Hitherto, investigations of the chemical constituents of medicinal plants have attracted much attention from chemists. Diterpenoids are a large group of naturally occurring chemical constituents found in terrestrial plants, microbes, insects, and marine organisms, which exhibit a wide variety of bioactivities, such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antitumor, and analgesic activities.Leucas species are perennial herbs and distributed mainly in East Africa and the subtropical area of Asia. There are about 125 Leucas species globally, of which 7 species grow in southern China. Studies on a few species led to the isolation of diterpenoids as active constituents, which exhibited anti-inflammatory and anti-mycobacterial activities. The aerial parts of L. zeylanica have been used as folk medicine in treating inflammatory diseases, e.g., pertussis, asthma, headache and indigestion.Our previous chemical investigations of L. zeylanica led to the identification of labdane diterpenoids and flavonoids. In search of novel, bioactive, and structurally diverse natural products from traditional Chinese folk medicine, four undescribed highly oxygenated diterpenoids, compounds 1–4, were isolated from the aerial parts of L. zeylanica. Among them, compound 1 was elucidated to be a halimane-type diterpenoid, while 2–4 were labdane-type diterpenoids (Figure 1). Here, we report the structures, anti-inflammatory effects and the potential mechanisms of the isolated diterpenoids.","The optical rotation value was tested through a JASCO P-1020 digital polarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan), while the acquisition of ECD spectra was carried out using a Jasco J-815 (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) circular dichroism spectrometer at room temperature. Briefly, 1D and 2D NMR data were recorded on a Bruker AV (Bruker Corporation, Basel, Switzerland) spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C), while TMS was used as an internal reference. The acquisition of HRESIMS data was carried out via a Q-TOF Ultima Global GAA076 LC (Billerica, MA, USA) mass spectrometer. Semi-preparative HPLC was carried out on an Agilent 1260 LC (Agilent Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA) infinity series, by loading an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 column (9.4 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Agilent Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA), using a DAD-UV detector. Silica gel (Qing Dao Hai Yang Chemical Group Co., Qing dao, China; 100–200, 200–300 mesh) was employed in column chromatography (CC). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (Yan Tai Zi Fu Chemical Group Co., Yan Tai, China, G60, F-254) was used to monitor the separation of samples. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using a Microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, California, USA) as a template reader.The aerial parts of Leucas zeylanica (Lamiaceae) were collected from Changjiang city, Hainan province of China, in July 2020, and were authenticated by Professor Yu-Kai Chen (School of Hainan Normal University, Changjiang, Hainan, China). The specimens (no. C20-L02) were deposited at the Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University (Haikou, Hainan, China).The aerial parts of L. zeylanica (10.0 kg) were extracted with 95% EtOH (3 × 25 L). A dark-brown crude extract (1.1 kg) was obtained after concentration in vacuo to remove most of the EtOH. The crude extract was suspended in distilled water and partitioned with PE (60–90) (3.0 × 1.0 L), EtOAc (3.0 × 1.0 L) and n-BuOH (3.0 × 1.0 L), yielding 90, 295 and 354 g of residues, respectively.The PE-soluble fraction (87 g) was subjected to silica-gel column chromatography (CC) (100–200 mesh) with gradient elution (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 0:100; v/v, 6 L each) to obtain four major fractions (Fr. P1-P4).The Fr. P-3 (15 g) part was separated by a silica-gel column and eluted with gradient mixtures of petroleum ether–acetone (from 5:1 to 1:1) to obtain fractions (Fr. P3-1-P3-5). Fraction Fr. P3-3 (6 g) was separated on Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia, Beijing, China) (CHCl3: MeOH, 1:1) and a RP-C18 silica-gel column (Qing Dao Hai Yang Chemical Group Co., Qingdao, China) (MeOH/H2O, from 70% to 100%) to obtain fractions of Fr. P33-1-P33-6 on the basis of TLC analysis. Fraction Fr.

E1-E2).Fr. E-3 (24.2 g) was subjected to an ODS column and eluted with MeOH/H2O (from 10:90 to 100:0 v/v), obtaining seven sub-fractions (Fr. E3-1-Fr. E3-7). Fr. E3-3 (1.7 g) was purified on a silica-gel column (200-300 mesh, petroleum ether–EtOAc, 100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 0:100 v/v) to yield five additional fractions (Fr. E33-1-Fr. E33-5). Fr. E33-3 (336 mg) was decolorized using a silicone column and eluted via gradient elution (MeOH-H2O, from 80:20 to 100:0 v/v), to yield three subfractions (Fr. E333-1-Fr. E333-3). Compounds 3 (2.1 mg) and 4 (5.6 mg) were obtained from Fr. E333-2 (87 mg) via HPLC (MeOH-H2O, 61:39 v/v).Fr. E-5 (1.2 g) was subjected to silica-gel column chromatography (CC) (200–300 mesh) using CHCl3-MeOH (100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 0:100; v/v) with gradient elution to retrieve five fractions (Fr. E5-1-Fr. E5-5). Fr. E5-3 (540 mg) was subjected to an ODS column eluting with MeOH/H2O (from 20:80 to 100:0 v/v) to obtain four subfractions (Fr. E53-1-Fr. E53-4). Fr. E53-3 (118 mg) was further purified via HPLC (MeOH-H2O, 68:32) to obtain compound 2 (7.8 mg).Colorless block crystals; [α]25D +11.43 (c 0.14, MeOH); mp 156.6–157.9 °C; UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 220 (3.91), 266 (3.02), 275 (2.95) nm; CD (c 0.0005, MeOH) λmax (Δε) 205 (+59.40), 293 (+9.90) nm; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD) and 13C NMR (100 MHz, CD3OD), see Table 1; HR-ESI-MS m/z 443.2415 (calcd as 444.2410 for C24H36O6Na).White powder; [α]25D +51.7 (c 2.1, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 222 (3.99), 306 (3.02), 318 (2.93) nm; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD) and 13C NMR (100 MHz, CD3OD), see Table 1; HR-ESI-MS m/z 444.2725 (calcd as 444.2726 for C24H39NO5Na).Colorless gum; [α]25D +24.84 (c 1.0, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 220 (3.90), 266 (3.25) nm; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD) and 13C NMR (100 MHz, CD3OD), see Table 2; HR-ESI-MS m/z 429.2256 (calcd as 429.2253 for C23H34O6Na).Colorless gum; [α]25D +20.53 (c 1.5, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 219 (3.95), 267 (3.69) nm; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD) and 13C NMR (100 MHz, CD3OD), see Table 2; HR-ESI-MS m/z 429.2260 (calcd as 429.2253 for C23H34O6Na).Crystals of compound 1 were obtained from MeOH at room temperature.

Using the direct methods (ShelXS) and refinement with the ShelXL program, structure determination and refinement were performed. Crystallographic data of compound 1 were deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC numbers: 2225700 for 1).

CCDC no. 2225700 (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).All isolated compounds were evaluated for their inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW264.7 cells activated by lipopoly saccharide (LPS) using the Griess assay with dexamethasone (DEX) as a positive control. RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/mL. After 12 h of incubation, the cells were pre-treated with the compounds (50 μM) and DEX (50 μg/mL) for 1 h and following additional LPS (1 μg/mL) treatment for 24 h at 37 °C. After 24 h, the quantity of NO accumulated in the culture medium was measured. Briefly, to the cell culture medium (50 µL) was added an equivalent volume of the Griess reagent. The absorbance was measured using a microplate reader at 540 nm wavelength.Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/mL. Incubation was performed for 12 h after which the compounds (50 μM) were used to treat the cells for 24 h. Subsequently, 20 μL of the MTT stock solution (5 mg/mL) was added to the wells. After 4 h incubation, the supernatants were aspirated. The formazan crystals in each well were dissolved in DMSO (150 µL), and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm using a microplate reader. The data were expressed as mean percentages of the viable cells compared to the respective control.Adult wild-type zebrafish (Danio rerio) were raised at a standard facility, which allows the control of stationary light and temperature. The zebrafish were treated with a light/dark photoperiod in 14:10 h cycles, and fed live brine shrimp 2 times a day. Further, the embryos were produced from the spawning of adult fish using a hatch box, and the incubation process from embryo to larvae was maintained at 28 °C. The larvae were collected and used for the toxic experiments. All the zebrafish procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Committee of Hainan Normal University.Although the anti-inflammatory activity of diterpenoids in zebrafish models has been reported previously, it is still not very common. Compound 4 was evaluated for zebrafish larval toxicity studies. Four hours post-fertilization (hpf) larvae were placed in 6-well plates at a count of 10 fish/well and compounds were added in the fish water at 4 different concentrations (12.5, 25, 50, and 100 µM). The EVOS digital microscope (4×) was used to detect toxic activity for the larval zebrafish up to 120 hpe (hours post-exposure). Prior to the test, larval zebrafish were checked for their viability, where a lack of heartbeat was considered death (acute toxic dose). Other indications of toxicity involved swim position, and morphological deficits such as malformations, larval length, tail curvature, and swim bladder inflation level.Cytokine levels were quantified using ELISA kits in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. After pretreatment with compound 4 (12.5, 25 and 50 μM) and DEX (50 μg/mL) for 1 h, cells were incubated with compound 4 and LPS for an additional 24 h, and cell culture supernatants were collected. The expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in the culture medium were assessed by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.RAW264.7 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates for 24 h. Cells were then pretreated with compound 4 for 1 h and stimulated with LPS (1 µg/mL). After 24 h of continuous incubation, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and collected. Cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing a freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail and phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride. The lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected to obtain the total protein concentration. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Equal amounts of protein were separated via SDS-PAGE(Beijing Liuyi Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at room temperature and then the membranes were further incubated with a primary antibody (iNOS and COX-2) at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Finally, protein blots were visualized using an ECL detection kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). β-actin was used as an internal reference. Each band was quantified using Image J software.Molecular docking was conducted in AutoDock using the hybrid Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA). The 3D structure of iNOS (PDB:3E6T) and COX-2 (PDB:1PXX) was downloaded from RCSB PDB (, accessed on 5 December 2022). The 3D structure of 4 was drawn in ChemDraw (, accessed on 5 December 2022) as ligands. The protein and ligand were converted to a PDBQT format using AutoDockTools. The ligands were set to flexible; the receptor was set to rigid. The conformation with the lowest binding free energy was finally identified as the best probable binding mode. Water molecules and the original ligand of the receptor were manually removed using PyMol software. Prepare_ligand4.py and prepare_recptor4.py scripts from AutoDockTools 1.5.6 were used to prepare the initial files of ligands including adding charges and hydrogen atoms.","Zeylleucapenoid A (1) was obtained as colorless crystals. Analysis of the HR-ESI-MS spectrum showed it had a molecular formula of C24H36O6, indicating seven degrees of unsaturation. The 1H and 13C-NMR spectral data of 1 (Table 1) suggested that they were very similar to those of Leucasperone B, except for the absence of an oxygenated methine at (δH 4.15/δC 71.3, CH) in Leucasperone B, and the additional presence of a methylene at (δH 1.56/δC 30.0, CH2) in 1. Based on this, compound 1 was considered an analogue of Leucasperone B. Further, the COSY cross-peak between H2-11/H2-12 confirmed that the methine of C-11 in Leucasperone B was replaced by a methylene in 1, which was supported by the key HMBC correlations from H2-11 to C-8/C-10/C-13, and from both H-8 and H3-20 to C-10/C-11 (Figure 2). The partial relative configuration of 1 was determined via NOESY correlations showing cross-peaks between both H-6 and Me-17 with Me-19, and H-8 with Me-20, which indicated that H-6 and Me-19 were in the same orientation (Figure 3), while H-8 and Me-20 were in another orientation. Finally, a comparison of the experimental and calculated ECD spectra of 1 suggested that the absolute configuration of C-4/C-6/-C-8/C-9 in 1 was that of 4S,6R,8R,9R, which is attributed to the spectrum of the isomer (4S,6R,8R,9R) of 1 which showed a similar trend to the experimental curve (Figure 4). However, the absolute configuration of C-13 in 1 was still not assigned. Fortunately, a single crystal of 1 was attained and the absolute configuration of 1 (Figure 5) was clearly defined to be (4S,6R,8R,9R,13S) via X-ray diffraction analysis (CCDC no. 2225700), and named as zeylleucapenoid A.Compound 2 was purified as a white powder. Its molecular formula, C24H39NO5, was defined using the HR-ESI-MS spectrum with an ion peak at m/z 444.2725 [M+Na]+ (that calcd for C24H39NO5Na was 444.2726), corresponding to six degrees of unsaturation. The 1H NMR data of 2 (Table 1) showed characteristic resonances for an olefinic proton at δH 6.79 (H-14), three methines including an oxygenated proton at δH 5.23 (H-6), and five methyls at δH 0.85 (H-17), 0.88 (H-19), 0.94 (H-18), 1.19 (H-20) and 1.98 (H-22). The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited 24 carbon signals in total, including two amide/ester carbonyls at δC 170.8 (C-16)/169.9 (C-21), two sp2 carbons at δC 139.5 (C-13)/135.3 (C-14), four methyls at δC 33.4 (C-19)/23.5 (C-18)/21.6 (C-22)/16.0 (C-17), three sp3 methines at δC 69.5 (C-6)/46.7 (C-5)/31.1 (C-8), three sp3 quaternary carbons at δC 75.6 (C-9)/43.4 (C-10)/33.5 (C-4), and nine methylenes. These spectral data indicated that 2 was an analogue of vitexlactam A, except for the additional existence of an ethoxy moiety in 2. Further analysis of 2D-NMR spectra of 2 confirmed the assignment above. In the COSY spectrum, the correlation between H2-23 and H2-24 was observable. In the HMBC spectrum, there were long-range correlations from H2-15 to C-23, and from H2-23 to C-15/C-16 (Figure 2), which suggested that the ethoxy moiety was connected to the nitrogen atom. The relative configuration of 2 was determined to be the same as that of vitexlactam A via an observation of NOESY correlations (Figure 3). In the NOESY spectrum, there were cross-peaks between Me-20 and H-8/H2-11/Me-18, indicating they were α-cofacial, while H-5/H-6/Me-19/9-OH were β-cofacial. The absolute configuration of 2 was determined to be 5R/6S/8S/9S/10R via a comparison of its specific rotation [α]25D + 51.7 (c 2.1, MeOH) with that of vitexlactam A [α]25D−10.7 (c 0.42, CHCl3), showing an opposite sign. Furthermore, a comparison of the calculated optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) spectrum of 2 tothe experimental one also supported that assignment, in which the calculated ORD spectrum of 5R,6S,8S,9S,10R of 2 agreed well with the experimental curve for 2 (Figure 6). Thus, 2 was elucidated as shown in Figure 1, and named zeylleucapenoid B.Compound 3 was isolated as a colorless gum. Its molecular formula was determined to be C23H34O6 using HR-ESI-MS data at m/z 429.2256 (calcd as 429.2253 for C23H34O6Na). The 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 2) of 3 were found to be similar to those for 6β-acetoxy-9α,13-epoxy-16-norlabd-13Z-en-15-al, as previously reported from L. zeylanica by our team, except for an additional appearance of an acetyl group (δH 2.03/δC 20.5, δC 173.1) and an oxygenated methylene (δH 4.48/δC 67.6) in 3, and the absence of a methyl (δH 1.05/δC 24.0) in 6β-acetoxy-9α,13-epoxy-16-norlabd-13Z-en-15-al. These data indicated that the methyl group in 6β-acetoxy-9α,13-epoxy-16-norlabd-13Z-en-15-al was oxygenated with an acetyl group in 3. This was supported by the HMBC correlations from H-5 to C-18, H2-18 to C-3/C-4/C-19 and C-21, Me-19 to C-4/C-5 and C-18, and Me-22 to C-21. The (Z) configuration of the Δ13(14) double bond was defined by the NOESY correlation of H2-12/H-14 (Figure 3). The relative configuration of 3 was assigned to be the same as that of 6β-acetoxy-9α,13-epoxy-16-norlabd-13Z-en-15-al, based on the NOESY correlations. The absolute configuration of 3 was established via a comparison of the experimental and calculated ORD spectra for it, which indicated that the calculated ORD spectrum (Figure 6) of 4R,5R,6S,8S,9S,10R of 3 agreed well with the experimental curve for 3. Thus, the structure of zeylleucapenoid C (3) was established as shown in Figure 1.Compound 4 was isolated as a colorless gum. Its molecular formula was determined to be C23H34O6 using HR-ESI-MS data at m/z 429.2260 (calcd to be 429.2253 for C23H34O6Na). The 13C NMR data (Table 2) closely resemble those of 3 except for a few deviations of chemical shifts from the signals for C-9 (ΔδC +1.8), C-11 (ΔδC −0.9), C-12 (ΔδC −0.8), C-13 (ΔδC −3.0), C-14 (ΔδC −1.0), and C-15 (ΔδC −2.5) in 4. Analysis of its 2D NMR spectra showed that 4 is a stereoisomer of 3. The main difference was the geometrical configuration of the Δ13(14) double bond. The lack of NOESY correlations observed between H2-12 and H-14 and the 3J12,14 = 2.0 Hz (3J12,14 = 0 Hz in 3) also verified that the Δ13(14) double bond was E-formed. Because the experimental ORD spectrum (Figure 6) of 4 was similar to that of 3, the absolute configuration of 4 was determined to be (4R,5R,6S,8S,9S,10R), and named zeylleucapenoid D.Considering the traditional anti-inflammatory efficacy of L. zeylanica, compounds 1–4 were examined for their ability to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production. Prior to the bioassay, the in vitro cytotoxic effects against cell viability were detected using the MTT method, and compounds 1–4 showed no cytotoxic activity with CC50 values of >100 μM. At non-cytotoxic concentrations, compound 4 exhibited significant effects on reducing the LPS-induced NO production with an IC50 value of 38.45 μM in RAW264.7 macrophages, while the positive control dexamethasone showed an IC50 value of 79.34 μM (Figure 7). Meanwhile, the zebrafish embryo toxicity test was thought to be suitable for the evaluation of the toxic property of drug candidates. Herein, active compound 4 was evaluated for toxicity activity using the zebrafish embryo model, which indicated that 4 showed nontoxic activity at the concentrations of 12.5, 50 and 100 μM, respectively (Figure 8). A subsequent ELISA assay uncovered that 4 could strongly suppress the secretion of LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines in a dose-dependent manner for RAW264.7 macrophages (Figure 9). In order to understand the possible anti-inflammatory mechanism, the effects of 4 on iNOS and COX-2 protein expression levels were examined via Western blotting, which indicated that compound 4 dose-dependently attenuated the levels of the inflammatory mediators iNOS and COX-2 (Figure 10). Based on the above, these data disclosed that compound 4 played an important role through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory enzyme expression, leading to an anti-inflammatory effect. To the best of our knowledge, there are a few reports of halimane-type diterpenoids without anti-inflammatory activity against NO release. Combining our results of anti-inflammatory activity for 1–4, it may be concluded that the substituent with a spiro-ring unit at C-9 was a potentially functionalized group. In addition, our discovery of non-toxicity against zebrafish embryos and binding with iNOS and COX-2 for 4 will promote the yield of lead compounds via further structural prioritization.To further recognize the possible binding modes of anti-inflammatory activity for 4, a molecular docking study was performed on 4 and both iNOS and COX-2 proteins. The result showed that 4 was well-accommodated in the binding pocket of iNOS, primarily interacted with Tyr341 and Arg375 residues through stable hydrogen bonds, and interacted with residues Trp84 and Val346 through hydrophobic bonds (Figure 11). Meanwhile, in the binding pocket of COX-2, compound 4 mainly formed stable hydrogen bonds with Tyr348, Val523 and Arg120 residues, and formed hydrophobic bonds with residues Val523 and Tyr355 (Figure 11). The lower binding energies of −5.862 and −6.722 kcal/mol also provided reliable evidence to confirm their strong affinity (Table 3). Therefore, the molecular docking analysis provided a perspective on the potential targets for 4, which will be helpful for discovering the specific binding site in a follow-up experiment.",,"Chemical investigations of the 95% EtOH extract of L. zeylanica allowed the obtention of four undescribed highly oxygenated halimane-type and labdane-type diterpenoids (1–4). The absolute configuration of the new compound, 1, was determined using theoretical ECD calculations and single-crystal diffraction. The absolute configuration of new compounds 2–4 was determined using theoretical ORD calculations. Among them, compound 4 showed significant anti-inflammatory activity against LPS-induced NO, TNF-α and IL-6 production, and the inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 protein expression levels. The molecular docking analysis indicated that 4 had a strong affinity with both iNOS and COX-2 through hydrogen and hydrophobic bond interactions with a few amino acid residues. These results were significative of the discovery of anti-inflammatory target and lead compounds for the treatment of inflammation-linked diseases."
95,TA048510,10.3390/md17110628,Effects of Astaxanthin from Shrimp Shell on Oxidative Stress and Behavior inAnimal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of astaxanthin (ASX) extracted and ASXpowder from shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) shells on Wistar rats with Alzheimer'sdisease, induced by amyloid-β (1-42) peptides. In this task, the rats weredivided into eight groups: (1) Control, (2) sham operate, (3) negative control(vehicle) + Aβ(1-42), (4) ASX extract+Aβ(1-42), (5) commercial ASX + Aβ(1-42),(6) ASX powder + Aβ(1-42), (7) blank powder + Aβ(1-42), and (8) vitamin E +Aβ(1-42). All treatments were orally administrated for 30 days. At 14- and29-days post injection, animals were observed in behavioral tests. On the 31stday, animals were sacrificed; the hippocampus and cortex were collected. Thosetwo brain areas were then homogenized and stored for biochemical and histologicalanalysis. The results showed that the Aβ(1-42) infused group significantlyreduced cognitive ability and increased memory loss, as assessed by the Morriswater maze test, novel object recognition test, and novel object location test.Moreover, the Aβ(1-42) infused group exhibited a deterioration of oxidativemarkers, including glutathione peroxidase enzymes (GPx), lipid peroxidation(MDA), products of protein oxidation, and superoxide anion in the cortex and thehippocampus. Meanwhile, ASX powder (10 mg/kg body weight) showed a significantreduction in cognitive and memory impairments and oxidative stress which isgreater than ASX extract in the same dose of compound or vitamin E (100 mg/kgbody weight). Our study indicates the beneficial properties of ASX in alleviationof cognitive functions and reducing neurodegeneration in Wistar rats induced byamyloid-β (1-42) peptides.","Taksima, Takunrat, Chonpathompikunlert, Pennapa, Sroyraya, Morakot, Hutamekalin, Pilaiwanwadee, Limpawattana, Maruj, Klaypradit, Wanwimol",2019,Marine drugs,2,False,False,True,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, which can damage memory and cognitive function while the biological mechanisms involved in AD are not yet fully understood. However, there is evidence to support the hypothesis that free radical-induced oxidative damage may be important. AD is associated with the overproduction of β-amyloid protein (Aβ), which accumulate in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Aβ appear to play a role in inducing oxidative stress through the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Oxidative stress has been reported to have many negative effects in humans, including lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, inflammation, disturbance of cell functions, apoptosis, and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. These disturbances can result in the loss of synaptic connections between neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, leading to reduction in cognitive function and dementia. One reliable way to protect cells from the damages of oxidative stress is to increase the potential of the endogenous oxidative defense through antioxidants, which can be part of the diet of pharmacological supplements. During the past decade, novel applications of naturally-occurring antioxidant compounds have been shown to have potential benefits.Astaxanthin (ASX) is a ketocarotenoid pigment, and naturally exists in plants, microorganisms, and aquatic animals such as crabs, shrimp, and salmon. ASX has been reported to exhibit potential pharmacological activity, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and immunomodulation. Moreover, according to its ability to traverse the blood-brain-barrier, ASX also has neuroprotective effects. Although previous studies demonstrated that ASX can prevent AD symptoms, all of published reports used ASX from Haematococcus pluvialis, which is quite difficult to cultivate in Thailand, the location of our study. However, a promising alternative source of ASX is processing waste from Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), which is a major export for the country. Thus far, scientific support of AD protection from this source of ASX has not yet been established. The ASX molecule, however, is unstable during the extraction process and in storage because its nonpolar structure is highly unsaturated, resulting in easily lost biological activity and thus considerably limiting its application in foods and dietary supplements. Encapsulation technology, a method of packing sensitive compounds within wall materials to protect from adverse conditions, is therefore applied to tackle such problems. Moreover, encapsulation has further benefits of enabling controlled release and delivery to the desired site of action. Microencapsulation of ASX can be accomplished by various processes including emulsion/solvent evaporation, coacervation, liposome formation, solvent displacement, and spray drying. However, little is known about the use of cryogenic incorporated freeze-drying to create a powdered form of ASX. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ASX extract and encapsulated ASX on cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in an animal model of amyloid beta-induced AD.","ASX was extracted from fresh Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) shells. Alginate was purchased from Union Chemical 1986 Co., Ltd. (Bangkok, Thailand). Modified starch was supplied by National Starch and Chemical (Bangkok, Thailand). Commercial ASX was purchased from GmbH (Staufen, Germany). Amyloid beta (1-42) peptides (Sigma, Camarillo, CA, USA), protein carbonate content assay kit (Sigma, USA), BCA protein assay kit (#23225, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), Anti-beta Amyloid antibody (ab2539, Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA) and Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) (ab6721, Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA) were also procured for the study. All chemicals and reagents used in this study were of AR grade.Adult male Wistar rats, eight weeks old, weighing 250–300 g were obtained from Nomura Siam International Co., Ltd. Rats were maintained (at room temperature: (22 ± 3 °C) with humidity of: 55% ± 10%), on a 12 h light-dark cycle (lights on 06.00–18.00), and with ad libitum access to water and foods. This study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of animal care outlined by the Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University (MOE 0521.11/105).ASX extraction was prepared according to a previously described method. To produce the ASX-powder, the emulsions were prepared by homogenizing the crude ASX (2 g/100 mL of wall material solution) with the wall material solution (alginate (2.0 g/100 mL) and modified starch (20 g/100 mL), mass ratio of 1:1) using a homogenizer (IKA T-25-Werke Gmbh & Co.KG, Staufen, Germany) at a rotational speed of 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The emulsion was converted into powders using cryogenic incorporated with freeze drying. The ASX-powder was collected and, stored in amber bottles.The rats were randomly divided into eight groups, each group consisted of eight rats, as follows: Group 1 was the control group (C); group 2 served as a sham control group (SO) and received artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF); groups 3–8 were Aβ1-42 infused groups in that they were injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with amyloid beta peptides Aβ1-42 by using stereotaxic apparatus. To produce neurotoxicity in groups 3–8, 10 µL of normal saline-dissolved Aβ1-42 at a concentration of 2 mg/mL, was injected bilaterally on the first day. After injection of Aβ1-42, infused group 3 received propylene glycol (negative control; V), infused group 4 received ASX extract at 10 mg/kg/day p.o. (AE), infused group 5 received commercial ASX at 10 mg/kg/day p.o. (AC), infused group 6 received ASX powder at 10 mg/kg/day p.o. (AP), infused group 7 received powder blank at 10 mg/kg/day p.o. (BP), and infused group 8 received vitamin E at 100 mg/kg/day p.o. (VE). All treatments were orally administered for 30 days after Aβ1-42 infused. On days 14 and 29 post injection, animals were observed in the following behavioral tests: Morris water maze test, object location test, and object recognition test. The animals in all groups were assessed on spontaneous locomotor behaviors before doing all experiment.The Morris water maze test (MWM) was developed by Richard Morris in 1981, and is a commonly used cognitive and behavioral assessment tool to evaluate both working and long-term spatial memory. Results of the test are thought to reflect the subject’s hippocampus function. MWM as shown in Figure S3, was performed on days 1–5 for training phases and on 14 and 29 day after oral administration compound of our experimental protocol, for testing phases. In the training phase, each rat was given four swimming trials per day for five consecutive days. In the testing phase, each rat receives the swimming trial or probe trial for the searching hidden platform, and the escape latency time was recoded. Twenty-four h later, the swimming trials or probe trial were conducted again, in which the platform was removed and rats were free to swim in the pool for 60 s. Time spent by the rat in the target quadrant (target quadrant occupancy or located that hidden platform stand) for the search of the removed platform were recorded. Data were recorded by using video-image camera connected with a computer analysis system to observe swimming time.The object location memory test is used to assess cognition, particularly in spatial memory and discrimination, in rodent models of central nervous system disorders. The fundamental concept of this test is that rodents are prone to give more time exploring a novel object than a familiar object and can remember when an object has been moved to a new location as shown in Figure S4. In our study, the test occurred in an open field arena, to which the animals were habituated beforehand. After habituation, two objects made of similar material were introduced to the arena. During the familiarization trial, the animals were allowed to explore the arena with the two objects for 3 min. After intervals of 30 min and 24 h, testing trials were done, in which one of the objects had been moved to a new location. Between trials, the objects and test areas were cleaned with 70% (v/v) ethanol to remove odor cues for later trials. The exploration activity, defined as sniffing while directing the nose toward and within 2 cm of the object, was separately scored for each object. Finally, the scores were used to calculate the discrimination index (ID) according to the formula: ID = (t [novel] − t [familiar])/ (t [novel] + t [familiar]) × 100.The object recognition test was used to assess the subject’s perception of color, shape, and texture as shown in Figure S5. In this test, each rat received two consecutive 3 min object exploration trials, separated by 1 and 24 h inter-trial intervals. During the familiarization trial, rats were individually presented with two similar objects. In the second trial, one of the two objects was randomly selected and replaced with a third, novel object. During the two trials, exploration of each object was defined as sniffing, licking, chewing, or having moving vibrissae while directing the nose toward the object, while within 2 cm of the object. Time of exploration was recorded separately for each object. Between trials, the objects and test areas were cleaned with 70% (v/v) ethanol to remove odor cues. Finally, the discrimination index was calculated as time spent exploring the novel object compared with the familiar object relative to the total time spent exploring all objects, according to the formula: Discrimination Index = (t [novel] − t [familiar])/(t [novel] + t [familiar]) × 100.After completion of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed and the brains were quickly collected. The hippocampus and cortex (n = 5) were dissected and the tissues were frozen and stored at −80 °C. The cortex and hippocampus tissues were homogenized in 0.2 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 25 min. Supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C for later determination of GPx activity and the levels of protein carbonyl, MDA, and superoxide anion.Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was determined by previously published methods, in which the activity is measured indirectly by a coupled reaction with glutathione reductase. Oxidized glutathione, produced upon reduction of hydrogen peroxide by glutathione peroxidase, is recycled to its reduced state by glutathione reductase and NADPH. The oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ is accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The rate of decrease in the A340 nm is directly proportional to the glutathione peroxidase activity. Our final 1 mL of system mixture contained 48 mM sodium phosphate, 0.38 mM EDTA, 0.12 mN β-NADPH, 0.95 mM sodium azide, 3.2 units of glutathione reductase, 1 mM glutathione (GSH), 0.02 mM DL-dithiothreitol, 0.0007% H2O2, and the standard enzyme glutathione peroxidase solution or a homogenate brain sample. The glutathione peroxidase solution was used as a standard for enzyme activity. The standard curve was plotted as the rate of A340 nm per min against GPx activity. One unit activity was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to catalyze the oxidation by H2O2 of 1 µmole of GSH to GSSG per min at pH 7 at 25 °C. Data were reported as units of GPx per mg protein.The O2− level was determined by spectrophotometric procedure according to Ukeda et al., and based on a xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XO) assay which is marked by a color change from nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT)-yellow to formazan-blue. The reagent mixture included ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), NBT, xanthine, and xanthine oxidase (XO), along with sample. Absorbance of formazan chromophore was measured at 560 nm against blank and standard curves of TEMPOL. The data were expressed as % inhibition, as calculated following the Equation (1). A = OD of reagent only and B = OD of reagent and sample.Protein carbonyl, produced during protein oxidation in the biological sample, was measured by using a commercial assay kit (Sigma, USA). Malondialdehyde (MDA) is produced during lipid peroxidation, and was measured using the methods of Ohkawa et al.. A calibration curve was prepared using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (TMP). A volume of 0.2 mL sample supernatant was mixed with 1.5 mL acetic acid (20%) at pH 3.5, 1.5 mL thiobarbituric acid (0.8%), and 0.2 mL sodium dodecyl sulphate (8.1%) and were added to processed tissue samples (0.1 mL), and then heated at 100 °C for 60 min, then cooled. A volume of 5 mL of n-butanol-pyridine (15:1) and 1 mL of distilled water were added and the mixture was vortexed vigorously. After centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min, the organic layer was withdrawn and absorbance was measured at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer (ASYS UVM340, Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Concentration of MDA was expressed as nmol/g tissue. The total brain protein assay was analyzed by the methods of Lowry et al. with slight modification using Pierce BCA assay kit.After test animals were sacrificed, the whole brains (n = 3) were fixed in Bouin solution (Bio-optica, Milano, Italy) for 72 h. The brains were washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and dehydrated sequentially in 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol and then transferred to toluene. They were infiltrated and embedded in paraffin, sliced to a thickness of 5 μm using a rotary microtome, Leica RM2235 (Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany), and then placed on silane-coated slides. They were deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated in 100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, and 70% alcohol, and finally stained with cresyl violet (0.5%) to determine the neuronal density in hippocampal CA1, CA3, and cortex regions. Neurons morphology was observed and captured by a Nikon E600 microscope with a DXM 1200 digital camera, using ACT-1 software (Nikon Inc., Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands). For all experimental groups, the surviving neurons were counted and recorded as number of neuron cells (size greater than 7 µm) using ImageJ (Java 1.4.2, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA, USA).For immunohistochemistry, the brain sections from the different groups were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated in ethanol as above. Endogenous peroxidase was removed using 3% H2O2 in 100% methanol for 90 min. After washing three times with 0.1 M PBS containing Tween-20 (PBST), the sections were incubated in 1% glycine in 0.1 M PBST for 15 min and then washed three times with 0.1 M PBST. The brain sections were then incubated in blocking solution containing bovine serum albumin (4%) and 2% normal goat serum in 0.1 M PBST for 2 h. The slides were then incubated with primary antibody: Anti-beta amyloid antibody (1:200; catalog no. ab 2529, Abcam, CA, USA) at room temperature overnight. They were washed three times for 5 min each with PBST and were then incubated with secondary antibody: HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; catalog no. ab 6721, Abcam) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing three times with PBST, liquid DAB-Plus Substrate Kit (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA, USA) was added onto the brain sections to develop the color for 2 min and the reaction was then stopped by RO water. The slides were counter-stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin and mounted with permount. The results were recorded using a Nikon E600 microscope with a DXM 1200 digital camera, and ACT-1 software. Data were expressed as positive staining of β-amyloid (% area; total area covered with plaques relative to the total area) using ImageJ.All data are presented as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Significant differences between groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by the LSD’s post hoc test. Statistical significance was assumed at a p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 17.0 software package for Windows.","The effect of ASX on spontaneous motor behaviors including grooming, rearing, and licking behaviors were demonstrated in Figure S1 in supplementary data. The results showed that all groups failed to show significant changes in all spontaneous motor behaviors. These indicated that the cognitive results from Morris water maze test, object recognition test, and object location test could be excluded from the false positive effect.The effects of ASX on spatial memory of rats were assessed by the escape latency and time spent in target quadrant in the Morris water maze (MWT) test as illustrated in Figure 1. Discrimination index scores recorded from the novel object location test (NOL) were shown in Figure 2C,D. The effect of ASX on non-spatial memory as determined by the object recognition test was shown in Figure 2A,B.Figure 1A,B, show that artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) produced no significant change in either escape latency or time spent in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze test. Intracerebroventricular administration of Aβ1-42 significantly increased escape latency and decreased time spent in target quadrant (p < 0.05, Figure 1A,B). These showed that the memory impairment was induced by Aβ1-42. Treatments with vitamin E (VE), ASX extract (AE), commercial ASX (AC), and ASX powder (AP) significantly decreased escape latency and increased time spent in target quadrant (p < 0.05) for all treatments. Interestingly, the AC and AP groups had significantly lower escape latency and higher time spent in target quadrant than the AE and VE treatment groups (p < 0.05).For the object recognition and location memory tests, the discrimination index was lower in Aβ1-42 treated rats compared with a sham control group (SO), while the groups treated with VE, AE, AC, and AP had significantly higher discrimination index. With the blank powder encapsulation, the discrimination index was not increased. In contrast, the discrimination index for the AC and AP treatments was significantly higher than the AE group for both the object recognition and location tests (Figure 2A–D). The aforementioned results confirm that treatments with ASX from white shrimp shells significantly improved learning and reduced memory dysfunction in the AD model induced by Aβ1-42 (p < 0.05). The AP treatment showed better learning and memory than AE (p < 0.05) and was equivalent with AC. Notably, the AE treated group did not improve the learning and memory functions than those of AP and AC treated mice.The lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA), level of protein carbonyl, glutathaione peroxidase (GPx) assays, and percent inhibition of superoxide anion were used to evaluate the free-radical scavenging capacity of ASX in both the cortex and hippocampus to compare non-treated, V-treated, VE-treated, and blank powder (BP)-treated groups. As shown in Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6, AE, AC, AP, and VE treated groups had decreased MDA, and protein carbonyl, while increased percent inhibition of superoxide anion and GPx activity when compared to the V-treated and BP-treated groups (p < 0.05). These results indicate that the effectiveness of ASX from white shrimp shell was not significantly different (p ≥ 0.05) from commercial ASX.The CA1 and CA3 in hippocampus, as well as the cortex regions were used as the reference zones because they are involved in memory and neuronal loss in these regions resulted in Alzheimer’s disease. The low power views of the mouse hippocampus and cortex were shown in Figure S2. Cresyl violet staining was used to evaluate the surviving neurons in the cortex and hippocampal CA1, CA3. Figure 7 shows that surviving cells in the control group (a, I, and q) showed round and pale-stained nuclei in the cortex and hippocampus whereas the Aβ1-42 treated group showed serious cell death (c, k, and s). The SO treatment was shown as not significantly different in the surviving neurons when compared to the control group. AC and AP (10 mg/kg) treatments showed a significant decrease in neuronal degeneration in CA1 and CA3 regions of hippocampus and the cortex, whereas the AE group showed a significant decrease in neuronal degeneration in the cortex only (t). The VE group treatment showed a significant decrease in neuronal degeneration in CA1 of hippocampus and cortex (g and w). The BP treated group with alginate and modified starch vehicle did not show any protection against neuronal injury (h, p, and x). On the other hand, significant accumulation of positive staining of β-amyloid (% area) was observed in the hippocampal and cortex of Aβ1-42 peptide infused rats using immunohistochemistry staining. Hippocampal CA1, CA3, and cortex of rats treated with ASX in various forms (AE, AC, AP, and VE) for 30 days showed a reduction of positive staining of β-amyloid when compared with other Aβ1-42 treated groups. Interestingly, AC and AP showed better biological activity than other treatments (Figure 8).","In recent years, ASX has gained attention for its potential therapeutic role in neurodegenerative diseases. Numerous reports that ASX treatment is effective at protecting neurons from various forms of CNS damage in models of specific neuronal damage and neurodegenerative disease. There are few studies investigating the benefits of ASX from Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) shell in neurodegenerative disease model, while there are many using Haematococcus pluvialis. In fact, our ASX extract from Pacific white shrimp shell processing waste contains higher proportion of ASX diester and higher PUFA content (61.74%) than Arabian red shrimp (PUFA content of 29.85%) and Haematococus pluvialis. This implies that the powerful antioxidant properties of carotenoid extract of Litopenaeus vannamai may be attributed to the antioxidant synergism of ASX and PUFAs contained when in compared to other sources of ASX.In this study, we determined the effects of ASX from white shrimp shells on spatial and non-spatial memory, and on neurodegeneration in various sub-regions of brain in the animal model of AD induced by Aβ1-42. The results clearly demonstrated that ASX from white shrimp shell significantly improved spatial memory (Figure 1; Figure 2C,D) as indicated by Morris water maze and object recognition tests, improved non-spatial memory (Figure 2A,B) as indicated by object recognition test, and reduced neurodegeneration, as indicated by surviving neurons and amyloid beta plaque level (Figure 8).Recently, oxidative stress has been detected in the early stage of AD through Aβ accumulation and progression via mitochondrial dysfunction, caused by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduction in the level of detoxifying enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and GPx. ROS destroys the polyunsaturated fatty acids of cellular membranes to generate lipid peroxidation products such as MDA, which may serve as an indicator of the oxidative damage level and induce neuronal deterioration. In addition, protein carbonyl is another hallmark of oxidative damage. As expected, the observed neuroprotection by ASX from white shrimp shell was due to its antioxidant property through support of the activity of GPx, and percent inhibition of superoxide anion, as well as reduction of MDA and protein carbonyl levels, compared to vehicle-AD groups (p < 0.05) as shown in Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6. This is consistent with our previous study, where we showed that the ASX from white shrimp shells eliminates superoxide anion, which causes lipid peroxidation. It is also consistent with the effects of ASX from Haematococcus pluvialis. ROS are associated with the formation of senile plaques in the brains of patients with AD, which may result in neuronal death. Our results showed that scavenging of ROS by orally administered ASX from white shrimp shells significantly reduced neuronal loss in both cortex and hippocampus when compared to vehicle-AD group (p < 0.05) as shown in Figure 7.We observed that amyloid plaque formation or aggregation via immunohistochemistry staining of amyloid beta peptide. The results shown in Figure 8, display that ASX significantly reduced positive staining of Aβ1-42 when compared to the vehicle-AD group (p < 0.05). The results were consistent with Rahman et al. (2019) who reported that ASX treatment showed significant protection against Aβ mediated neuronal damage and forming plaque in the hippocampus.In the last decade, the encapsulation technique has been shown to be an effective method to protect bioactive compounds within a shell and provides many other advantages. ASX is a highly unsaturated molecule and naturally not stable, and thus its functional ability is easily degraded during processing and storage. Another disadvantage is that ASX from shrimp shells may change the color and flavor of food. Encapsulation is an effective means to protect the stability of ASX within the selected wall material also it can help increase the surface area for release to the intestine. Our results showed that AP could improve learning both spatial and non-spatial memory compared with AE, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. In addition, AP showed significantly decreased oxidative damage and amyloid plaque level, and increased survival of neurons in both cortex and hippocampus areas when compared with those of the AE treatment groups. Therefore, use of encapsulation technology to improve the stability and efficacy of ASX extract in powder form is recommended for potential application in disease prevention of AD.","Here, we observed that after oral administration for one month, ASX from shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) shells protected Wistar rats from Aβ1-42 induced oxidative stress and resulted in improved learning and memory. Our study aimed to compare the effects of ASX in various forms, and we found that ASX powder showed better protection against cognitive dysfunction than the ASX extract at the same dose of compound. On the basis of these results, we suggest that ASX powder may be a promising candidate as a functional food product to protect from brain disorders, including in AD therapy."

']nan","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais.The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed.To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C).A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes).To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil.To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable.","['results and discussion ', 'transposon insertion mutagenesis Transposon insertion mutagenesis was performed by using the mini-Tn5 plasmid and biparental conjugation as described by Larsen et al.

Geraniol and geranial accumulated transiently to 7 and 10 μM, while geranic acid accumulated up to 200 μM. Low cellular concentrations of the toxic geraniol and geranial are due to high affinities of the corresponding enzymes, which is part of a cellular defense [\\[29](#page-7-0)].

Proteins annotated as linalool isomerase, geraniol dehydrogenase, the two subunits of geranyl-CoA carboxylase as well as a 3-hydroxy-3-isohexenylglutaryl-CoA:acetate lyase were identified together with ![](_page_3_Figure_9.jpeg) Fig. 2 Growth of T. linaloolentis 47LolT on 2 mM (R,S)-linalool under denitrifying conditions. a Optical density at 600 nm as a measure for growth and linalool concentration in mM, b Optical density at 600 nm as a measure for growth and geraniol, geranial and geranic acid concentration in μM. Experiment was performed in duplicates. Initial increase in linalool concentration is due to time-dependent dissolution of linalool in medium. Linalool decreased accompanied with an increase in optical density. Geraniol and geranial accumulated only transiently, while geranic acid accumulated up to 200 μM the two subunits of the methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase and the isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase of the leucine degradation pathway (liu operon). ', 'genome annotation Two publicly available draft genomes of T. linaloolentis 47Lol<sup>T</sup> were assembled and yielded a draft genome with 23 contigs of 4,402,076 bp, an overall G + C content of 66.6 %, 4084 open reading frames, 46 transfer RNA genes and 1 ribosomal RNA operon. The genome completely covers central metabolic pathways, e.g. citric acid cycle, β-oxidation of fatty acids, oxygen respiration and denitrification. Genetic information from P. citronellolis, P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Atu and Liu pathway) and C. defragrans 65Phen (linalool isomerization and geraniol/geranial oxidation) were used to identify homologous genes in T. linaloolentis 47Lol<sup>T</sup> (Table [1\\)](#page-3-0). Annotations were fully supported by the aforementioned protein identification. One result of the reassembly was the formation of two large contigs that contained all genes of the Atu and Liu pathways over a region of 24 and 9.1 kb, respectively. The atu genes were organized with the putative linalool isomerase gene lis downstream of atuCFE and the genes for the geraniol oxidation geoAB upstream of atuA (Fig. 3). The genes in between were annotated as hypothetical proteins. Gene homologs for atuB and atuG, the putative citronellol and citronellal dehydrogenases, were identified in the draft genome but did not show significant similarity in a reciprocal best match analysis.

Enzyme activities of a linalool isomerase, geraniol and geranial dehydrogenases together with the formation of geranic acid demonstrated the initial degradation pathway. Mass spectrometry identified the carboxylases of Atu and Liu pathways which indicated the utilization of these pathways for geranic acid degradation. The draft genome contained the atu genes together with candidate genes for the initial degradation pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an active Atu pathway outside of the genus Pseudomonas and under anoxic conditions. ']"

Lipidnanosystems have great potential for transdermal drug delivery. Nanoemulsions andnanoemulsion gels were prepared to enhance percutaneous permeation.Microstructure and in vitro/in vivo percutaneous delivery characteristics oftriptolide (TPL)-nanoemulsions and TPL-nanoemulsion gels were compared. Theintegrity of the nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels during transdermal deliveryand its effects on the surface of skin were also investigated. The penetrationmechanisms of nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels were investigated bydifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR). The transport characteristics of fluorescence-labellednanoemulsions were probed using laser scanning confocal microscopy. A chronicdermatitis/eczema model in mice ears and the pharmacodynamic of theTPL-nanoemulsion gels were also investigated. RESULTS: Compared to TPL gels,significantly greater cumulative amounts of TPL-nanoemulsion gels andTPL-nanoemulsions penetrated rat skin in vitro. The in vivo microdialysis showedthe concentration-time curve AUC(0-t) for TPL-NPs is bigger than the TPL-gels. Atthe same time, TPL-NPs had a larger effect on the surface of skin. By hydratingkeratin and changing the structure of both the stratum corneum lipids andkeratin, nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels influence skin to promotepercutaneous drug penetration. Both hairfollicles and the stratum corneum arealso important in this transdermal drug delivery system. Moderate and highdosages of the TPL-nanoemulsion gels can significantly improve the symptoms ofdermatitis/eczema inflammation and edema erythematic in mice ears and can reducethe expression of IFN-γ and IL-4. Moreover, the TPL-nanoemulsion gels cause lessgastrointestinal damage than that of the Tripterygium wilfordii oral tablet does.CONCLUSIONS: Nanoemulsions could be suitable for transdermal stably releasingdrugs and maintaining the effective drug concentration. The TPL-nanoemulsion gelsprovided higher percutaneous amounts than other carriers did. These findingssuggest that nanoemulsion gels could be promising percutaneous carriers for TPL.The TPL-nanoemulsion gels have a significant treatment effect ondermatitis/eczema in the mice model and is expected to provide a new,low-toxicity and long-term preparation for the clinical treatment ofdermatitis/eczema in transdermal drug delivery systems.","Yang, Meng, Gu, Yongwei, Yang, Dishun, Tang, Xiaomeng, Liu, Jiyong",2017,Journal of nanobiotechnology,2,False,False,True,"Triptolide belongs to the Celastraceae family and is used extensively as an antirheumatoid, anti-eczema, immunosuppressive, nephrotic syndrome and malignant tumour agent in traditional Chinese medicine. The pharmacological effects of TPL are attributed to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-tumor and immune-regulating properties. However, the oral intake of TPL exists in a high-toxicity region, and the digestive system and urogenital system have adverse reaction rates of 35.8 and 22.8%, respectively, severely limiting its clinical application. Transdermal drug delivery is an important approach to effectively reduce these adverse reactions. Transdermal delivery is superior to oral administration as a route for TPL because it avoids the first-pass metabolism in liver, reducing its oral drug damage to the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney. However, its composition is complicated by poor water solubility and difficult entry through the skin, which affects the extent of its curative effect and the pharmacokinetics of its metabolic conversion in the skin, for which both of the mechanisms are unclear. O/W nanoemulsion gels, used as transdermal drug delivery carriers, can enhance a drug’s solubility and can move it easily through the skin, improving its efficiency. Additionally, nanoemulsion gels can control the drug’s release, maintaining stable and lasting blood drug concentrations.Lipid-based nanosystems are relatively new nanocarriers that are used for transdermal drug delivery. Nanoemulsions is a kind of transparent or semi-transparent and thermodynamic unstable system formed by an appropriate proportion mixture of mixing oil phase, aqueous phase, surfactant and co-surfactant. Nanoemulsions can’t form spontaneously and require external shear to overcome surface tension. Compared to the others formulates, the nanoemulsions could maintain a longer stability in the process of storage and application. Higher stability and better solubility of solutes are also the characteristics of nanoemulsions, and the drugs may be loaded in the internal phase or distribute in the external phase of nanoemulsions. The W/O nanoemulsions can extend the water-soluble drugs release time and effect, O/W nanoemulsions can increase the lipophilicity drug solubility and the B.C nanoemulsions is the transition states between the W/O and O/W, which is little practical application. Nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels are two types of nanocarriers that have been shown to enhance transdermal permeation. Compared with other transdermal vehicles such as gels, creams, tinctures, and lipid-gels, they enhance drug solubility and have a simple preparation process, a good physical stability, a low viscosity, a good targeting effect and a controlled release for long-term effects. However, the facts that the lack of adhesion with skin and water phase evaporating in the storage process and that the skin irritation all need further studies for the application of nanoemulsions. Alves etc. put forward the concept of nanoemulsion gels which was prepared by nanoemulsions with a proportional gel matrix. Nanoemulsion gels have the beneficial properties of nanoemulsions but overcome their limitations, including chemical instability and skin irritation. Furthermore, nanoemulsion gels have been confirmed to produce efficient transdermal drug permeation.A number of strategies were carried out to investigate the pharmacokinetic of TPL formulations and to obtain more reasonable treatment of this active compound. In this study, we prepared and evaluated TPL-nanoemulsions and TPL-nanoemulsion gels, to observe them physicochemical, transport, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics in blood and in skin as percutaneous administration.","Triptolide was purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Biological technology co., LTD (Shanghai, China).

Tripterygium wilfordii tablets were purchased from China resources san-jiu (Yellowstone) pharmaceutical co., Ltd. (Hubei, China). All other chemicals were of analytical purity and commercially available.Male SD rats were of clean grade, weighed 200 ± 20 g and were approximately 2 months of age. Male ICR mice were of SPF grade, weighing 22–26 g. The animal study was approved by the Experimental Animal Center, Second Military Medical University. Animals were acclimatized for at least 7 days before the start of the study and were kept in an agreeable environment with free access to water and rodent diet.Triptolide samples were analyzed using an Agilent HPLC system (HP 1260, Agilent Technologies, Inc., California, USA) with a Hypersil BDS C18 column (Dalian Elite Analytical Instruments Co., Ltd, Dalian, China), (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase consisted of a solution of methyl alcohol and water (48:52, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 25 °C, and the detector was set at 218 nm. Quantified samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm filter membrane (Shanghai Boguang biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) before automatic injection into the HPLC system. The automatic injection volume was 20 μL and the sensitivity was 0.01 AUFS.The in vivo and in vitro dialysate samples were analyzed using an Agilent 6400 Series Triple Quad LC/MS. The FAR 12.211 data analysis system was used. Chromatographic separation was achieved on an XTerraR MS C18 column (Waters, USA), (2.1 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm) maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase consisted of methyl alcohol: 0.1% (v/v) aqueous formic acid (60:40 v/v) with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min, and the injection volume was 3 μL. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive mode. The spry voltage was set to 4000 kv, and the capillary temperature was set at 350 °C. The atomizer pressure was 33 psi. The selected reaction monitoring mode was multiple reactions monitoring (MRM), and quantitative analysis was performed on ions at m/z 361.3/105.2, minus the internal standard monitored at 361.3/147. Before automatic injection into the LC/MS, the quantified samples were centrifuged at 10,000 r/min for 5 min.TPL-nanoemulsions were prepared by the high-energy emulsification method with Capryol 90, OP-10 and 1,2-propanediol as the lipid, surfactant and co-surfactant, respectively. TPL was dissolved in a certain proportion of capryol 90, OP-10 and 1,2-propanediol. The required amount of the aqueous phase (distilled water) was then added to the oleic phase dropwise under seed mixing using a constant-temperature magnetic stirrer (MS-H-Pro, Rocky Hill, USA). Carbomer 940 was used as the gels matrix, and 1.5% Carbomer 940 was mixed with a suitable amount of grinding glycerin for wetting. Then, the prepared nanoemulsions were gradually added to a vessel to achieve uniform grinding. After swelling, TPL-nanoemulsion gels were acquired.The Malvern Autosizer Nano ZS 90 inspection system (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) was used to measure the average size and the zeta potential (ZP) of every prepared nanoemulsions via dynamic light scattering. The appearance of the TPL-nanoemulsions was examined by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Libra 200, Carlzeiss, Germany). The samples were placed on a copper coated film to dry for approximately 30 min. Then, a drop of 2% phosphotungstic acid was added to the film and allowed to dry for 15 min. The samples were examined with the TEM. Then, the ultra-filtration method was used to measure the amount of free drug. Centrifugal filter tubes (10 kDa, Pall Corporation, NY, USA) were used to estimate the DL. The DL was calculated using the following equation:where Wtotal, Wfree and Wlipid are the total amount of TPL in the preparation, the amount of untapped TPL and the amount of lipid used in the formulation, respectively.The dialysis method was used to assess the initial drug release. Dialysis bags (molecular weight cutoff: 10 kDa) containing 2 mL of the test formulations were firmly tied and immersed in 30 mL of PBS (pH = 7.4) containing 20% anhydrous ethanol at 37 ± 0.5 °C and stirred at 100 rpm. Aliquots of receiving liquid (1 mL) were taken from receiving pool at 0.167, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h and then replaced with the same volume of fresh medium. The withdrawn samples were centrifuged under 10,000 r/min for 5 min and measured using HPLC. All experiments were performed in triplicate.Abdominal skin from the male SD rats was excised after hair was removed with depilatory, and then the subcutaneous fat and connective tissue were carefully removed. The obtained skin was rinsed with physiological saline and put in freezer for later use. In vitro permeation experiments were conducted using a Franz diffusion cell (Haimen yaohua glass instrument plant, Jiangsu, China), whose donor compartment had a diffusion area of 0.785 cm2, and each receptor compartment was filled with 5 mL of PBS (pH = 7.4) containing 20% anhydrous ethanol. The PBS was maintained at a temperature of 37 ± 1 °C and stirred at 300 rpm using a homemade transdermal diffusion apparatus. The saturated aqueous solution, 0.5 mL of the triptolide nanoemulsions and triptolide ordinary gels, and 0.5 g of the triptolide nanoemulsion gels were added to the donor compartment. After 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h, 1 mL of receiving liquid (and 1 mL from the receptor compartment) was removed and centrifuged at 10,000 r/min for 5 min. Collected samples were analyzed using HPLC.The microdialysis system used was composed of a Baby Bee Syringe Drive (MD1001), a 1 mL Bee Stinger Gastight Syringe (MD0100), a Work Bee Controller (MD1000, MD-1020), a Linear Microdialysis Probe (MD-2000, LM-10) and a Vascular Microdialysis Probe (MD-2310, IV-10), all of which were purchased from BASi (West Lafayette, America).Standard solutions were prepared by dissolving triptolide in PBS (pH = 7.4). The concentrations of the standard solutions were 100, 500, 1000 ng/mL.The in vivo and in vitro recovery rates of microdialysis probes were shown in Additional file 1.9 SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, and their abdominal hairs were wiped off before the day of the experiment, according to the procedure described for the in vivo recovery validations of the implanted linear microdialysis probe and the vascular microdialysis probe. The probe was continuously perfused with PBS (pH = 7.4) at a flow rate of 3 μL/min. After an equilibration period of 60 min, the ordinary gels, the nanoemulsions or the nanoemulsion gels of triptolide was applied to the abdomen of each group of animals. Doses of 0.5 g were administered to dosing areas measuring 3 × 4 cm2, which was covered with polyethylene film. During the experiment, the probe and the application site were kept at same level. Dialysate samples were collected in vials and were replaced every 30 min to produce 90 μL samples. Dialysis sampling was performed for 12 h. Determination of the dialysis samples was performed by LC–MS, and Kinetica 5.0 software was used to draw a pharmacokinetic curve and set the computational medicine dynamics parameters.Using the same procedure described for the in vitro transdermal experiments, samples of rat abdominal skin were prepared. Using a Franz diffusion cell, the skin was treated for 12 h with normal saline (as a blank control), the TPL-nanoemulsions, the blank nanoemulsions, the TPL-nanoemulsion gels, a blank nanoemulsion gels and TPL-gels. Then, the treated skin was flushed with normal saline and fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Skin samples were embedded in paraffin, and slices were prepared and subjected to HE staining. Observation with a light microscope (Leica, Buffalo Grove, Germany) was used to study the different carrier effects on the structure of the skin surface.Using the same procedure described for the Histopathological examination, the skin was removed and rinsed clean with distilled water. To prepare the sample, it was wrapped in moisture-absorbent paper and placed into a − 80 °C refrigerator to precool for 1 h before dehydrating for 48 h in the freeze dryer. The microstructure of the cutin layer of the skin was observed with an SEM (HITACHI S-4800, Tokyo, Japan).Using the same procedure described for the Histopathological examination, the skin was put into a − 80 °C refrigerator to precool for 1 h and then was dehydrated for 48 h in the freeze dryer and cut into small pieces. Skin samples (4 mg) were put in an aluminium plate for DSC (Shimadzu DSC-60, Kyoto, Japan). The scanning rate was 10 °C/min and the temperature range was 30–400 °C. Analysis the DSC curve was performed to study the different carrier effects on the phase behavior of the cutin layer of the skin.Using the same procedure described for the Histopathological examination, the skin was put into a − 80 °C refrigerate or to precool for 1 h and then dehydrated for 48 h in the freeze dryer and cut into small pieces. Adequately sized samples were taken to conduct the FTIR (Nicolet 6700 FT-IR, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) analysis. The resolution was 2 cm−1; the sweep number was 100; the scan range was 650–4000 cm−1. Analysis of the spectra revealed the different carrier effects on cuticle protein and keratin.Coumarin-6 (Yuanye biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) fluorescent probes were used to mark the TPL-nanoemulsions and TPL-nanoemulsion gels. Using the same conditions described for the in vitro transdermal experiments, coumarin-6-TPL nanoemulsions and the coumarin-6-TPL nanoemulsion gels were used to treat the skin for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 min. The skin was removed and rinsed clean with distilled water, according to the detection requirements, to study the skin. A fluorescence microscope (Leica, Buffalo Grove, Germany) was used to observe the different nanocarriers transports and dynamic distribution processes in the skin.The mice model of dermatitis/eczema was established using a solution of DNCB acetone, a thickness gauge to measure the thickness of the ears of the ICR rat and evaluate the ear-swelling rate and the degree of inflammation. The 72 male ICR rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, model, a low dose of TPL-nanoemulsion gels (15 mg/kg), a moderate dose (45 mg/kg), a high dose (90 mg/kg) and a control group that was given Tripterygium wilfordii tablets (10 mg/kg). After starting the sensitization of the rats, the nanoemulsion gels groups were given different doses of TPL-nanoemulsion gels on the abdomen at 0.5 g once a day. The control and model groups were given the same amount of gels-containing medicine. The groups of Tripterygium wilfordii tablets were given via intragastric administration, at doses of 0.2 mL, once a day. The above groups were administered for 14 consecutive days. We measured and rated the ear thickness before and after the excitation. At 24 h after the last excitation, the ear thicknesses were measured, the mice were sacrificed, and their blood was centrifuged at 3000 r/min. The upper serum was saved in a − 70 °C refrigerator for later use. The mice ears and stomach were fixed with 4% poly formaldehyde for later use.The ELISA method was used to measure the cytokine concentration of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-8 in the animal serum. The ELISA detection procedure is as follows: First, removed the microplate from the sealed bag that has been balanced to room temperature. Second, added the different concentration standards, quality control samples and experimental samples to corresponding hole (100 μL/hole). Third, sealed the reaction space with adhesive tape and incubate for 2 h at room temperature. Fourth, used the automatic washing machine to wash the microplate, added 300 μL of washing liquid to each hole, repeated 4 times and then turned the microplate upside down. Fifth, added 200 μL enzyme markers antibody to microporous, sealed the reaction hole and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Sixth, washed the microplate again, added 200 μL chromogenic substrate, incubated in dark at room temperature for 30 min. Lastly, added 50 μL terminated liquid in each hole using a microplate reader measured the absorbance values of 450 nm within 30 min.The mice’s ears and stomachs were treated to make paraffin sections, and then H&E staining was performed to observe the pathological changes in the tissue’s structure.Results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). P < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant; P < 0.01 were considered to be extremely significant. The pharmacokinetic parameters of skin and blood were calculated using the Kinetica 5.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., USA). The pharmacodynamic was calculated using Graphpad 6.02 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, USA).","The optimal procedure for the preparation of the TPL-nanoemulsions included 0.025% triptolide, 18% Capryol 90, 30% OP-10, 15% 1,2-propylene glycol and 37% water. The particle size and PDI are important characteristics of nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels that describe the distribution of nanoparticles. The nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels had PDI values of 0.13 ± 0.018 and 0.19 ± 0.023, respectively, and narrow size distributions of 45.6 ± 1.7 and 62.1 ± 9.9 nm, respectively. Additionally, the DL of the nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels associated with TPL were 0.025 ± 0.30 and 0.0245 ± 0.33%, respectively.The morphologies of the TPL-nanoemulsions and TPL-nanoemulsion gels were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1, the nanoemulsions have uniform spheres and an obvious two-layered structure. Together, the core and the surrounding external parts is approximately 30 nm. A roughly normal distribution is observed for the particle size, showing that it meets the requirements of nanoemulsions and that the preparation has good uniformity. The cumulative release percentage profiles of TPL from the TPL-nanoemulsions, the TPL-nanoemulsion gels and the TPL-gels are shown in Fig. 2. Both the nanoemulsion gels and the nanoemulsions dispersions significantly enhanced the in vitro TPL release for 24 h. The nanoemulsion gels, the nanoemulsions and the gels formulations show a controlled release with a sudden release at 12, 6 or 8 h, respectively (of 70, 56 and 48%, respectively). The results showed the TPL dispersions from nanoemulsion gels, the nanoemulsions and the ordinary gels were 76.2 ± 2.0, 61.2 ± 0.4 and 53.2 ± 0.4, respectively. The total amounts of the drug that releases from the nano-formulations were slightly greater than that released from the ordinary gels. In this study, the nanoemulsion gels enhanced the transdermal permeation of TPL (as shown in Fig. 3) more effectively than the nanoemulsions did. Initially, TPL was released rapidly from both the nanoemulsions and the nanoemulsion gels, but they later showed a sustained release, which is consistent with the in vitro release study. The results shown in Table 1 include the cumulative osmotic quantity and penetration rate of the 4 drug delivery systems, which are ranked as follows: TPL-nanoemulsion gels > TPL-nanoemulsions > TPL-gels > TPL-saturated aqueous solution. The triptolide saturated aqueous solution has difficulty passing through the skin, and preparation of the drug into the nano-formulations enhances the percutaneous absorption of the drug.  In vivo time-concentration profiles of TPL after topical application of the TPL-nanoemulsions and the TPL-nanoemulsion gels on the skin of rats are depicted in Fig. 4, and the resultant pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The peak concentrations (Cmax) of the TPL-nanoemulsions and the TPL-nanoemulsion gels were similar at approximately 6 h after administration. The Cmax were 833.75, 976.21 and 375.15 ng/mL (for skin) and 747.41, 762.98 and 312.75 ng/mL (for blood) for the samples treated with the TPL-nanoemulsion gels, TPL-nanoemulsions and the TPL-gels, respectively. The areas under the concentration–time curves (AUC0–t) of the nanoemulsion gels and the nanoemulsions were 2.26- and 2.25-fold higher in the skin, respectively (2.93- and 2.54-fold higher in the blood, respectively) than that of the TPL-gels. The TPL-gels had difficulty passing through the skin, causing the skin and blood concentrations to be lower than that of the TPL-nanoemulsions and the TPL-nanoemulsion gels, which have better transdermal effects. Compared with the TPL-nanoemulsions, the TPL-nanoemulsion gels has a higher AUC in the skin and blood after the percutaneous drug delivery, and the drug concentration is released more smoothly, providing a sustained release effect and an improved bioavailability.  Histopathological analysis of microscopic slides of the rat skin (Fig. 5) shows that the surface of the control rat skin (without any treatment) had a tightly compacted stratum corneum that was smooth and intact (Fig. 5a). However, the surface of the skin exposed to the TPL-gels (Fig. 5b), the TPL-nanoemulsions (Fig. 5c) or the TPL-nanoemulsion gels (Fig. 5d) formulation showed a fall-off phenomenon, which includes thinning of the stratum corneum and widening of its cracks. The treated rat skin was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to inspect the effect of the different formulations on the structure of the stratum corneum. Compared with the control group, the TPL-gels made the corneous layer loose and irregular, while the TPL-nanoemulsions resulted in a curly and deformed stratum corneum and the TPL-nanoemulsion gels causes the cuticle to further fall off the skin.The influences of each formulation on the stratum corneum were investigated by DSC and FTIR. Thermograms corresponding to reference data from rat skin treated with the normal control, the TPL-gels, the TPL-nanoemulsions and the TPL-nanoemulsion gels are shown in Fig. 6. This study shows three endothermic peaks: T1, T2 and T3. After the formulations were applied, T1 showed a gradual decline, indicating that the formulation changed the structure of the lipids in the skin and improved the liquidity. T2 (as shown) was caused by the denaturation of cell proteins, and in contrast with the control group, the gels-treated group showed degeneration of the stratum corneum proteins. The keratin in the nanoemulsions-treated group degraded substantially, whereas the keratin of the nanoemulsions-treated group degraded the most. T3 was the high-temperature absorption peak, and with increases in the water content, the endothermic peak became sharp and shifted toward lower temperatures. The T3 peak of the control group was 178.16 °C, which fell to 137.85 °C for the group treated with the TPL-nanoemulsion gels. The lipids in the stratum corneum appeared in the infrared spectrum at characteristic peaks between 3000 and 2800 cm−1, which mainly correspond with lipid CH2 symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations. The asymmetric stretching vibration frequency of CH2 was between 2920 and 2930 cm−1, and the symmetric stretching vibration frequency was between 2850 and 2860 cm−1. As Fig. 7, after the formulations acted on the skin, the lipid structure in the stratum corneum became disordered, this weakened the CH2 symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration peak. This implies awaked lipid barrier in the stratum corneum, especially for the TPL-nanoemulsion gels group but also for the TPL-nanoemulsions group, and, least of all, for the TPL-gels group. Typical hydration of the corneous layer is characterized by strong amino (1500–1700 cm−1) and water (3000–3600 cm−1) peaks. The characteristic peaks of the amide I and amide II vibrations (1600–1700 and 1500–1600 cm−1, respectively) were due to the keratin in the stratum corneum. The vibration of the amide I from 1647 to 1636 cm−1, and the vibration of the amide II from 1545 to 1513 cm−1 suggest that the corneous layer of keratin may transition from an alpha helix to a random coil. The symmetric stretching vibration frequency of O–H was between 3200 and 3300 cm−1, and the substantial increase in the O–H vibration from 3293 to 3276 cm−1 suggests that keratin became hydrated. Both keratin hydration and the structural changes to the lipids and keratin can reduce the barrier function of the stratum corneum and thus promote the percutaneous penetration of the drug. Three fomulations FTIR peak areas of methylene, carbonyl, amide I and amide II were shown in Table 3.  Figure 8 shows the fluorescence photomicrograph of skin treated with coumarin-6-TPL-NPs fluorescent probes. The fluorescence was mainly detected in the stratum corneum at first, with no evidence of diffusion into the epidermis. Coumarin-6 fluorescence was primarily localized in the hair follicles as well as in the stratum corneum. After 30 min, there was a more significant fluorescence in the hair follicles treated with either the coumarin-6-TPL-nanoemulsion gels or the coumarin-6-TPL-nanoemulsions. It is clear that coumarin-6 fluorescence was largely retained in the hair after laser exposure, revealing that substantial amounts of the drug passed through skin appendant organs such as hair follicles, to percutaneous absorption. At longer durations, a broad and continuous fluorescence band extended from the stratum corneum into the deeper layers of the epidermis. A similar result was both observed for the A and B groups, but the B group reached the epidermis before the A group, and the A group caused the stratum corneum to show a fall-off phenomenon. According to the earlier report that established the dermatitis/eczema model in rats, ear symptoms such as swelling and thickening are common after building the model, as shown in Fig. 9a, b. After the last excitation, the thickness of the rat’s ears in the control and model group were 0.225 ± 0.010 and 0.332 ± 0.036 mm (P < 0.01), respectively, indicating that the model was successful. ELISA was used to measure the cytokine concentration of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-8 in the animal serum. The results show that the concentrations of IFN-γ and IL-4 were significantly increased in model group. Moderate and high doses of the TPL-nanoemulsion gels can significantly reduce IFN-γ and IL-4 expression. The concentration of IFN-γ was reduced from 257.17 ± 8.48 to 129.79 ± 3.41 and 76.46 ± 3.19 ng/mL for the moderate and high doses, respectively (P < 0.01), and the concentration of IL-4 reduced from 45.54 ± 1.77 to 29.68 ± 1.60 and 25.01 ± 1.57 ng/mL, respectively (P < 0.01); Tripterygium wilfordii tablets also show an obvious inhibitory effect on IFN-γ and IL-4. However, the model, TPL-nanoemulsion gels and the Tripterygium wilfordii tablets have no significant influence on IL-8 expression. The results are shown in Fig. 9c. The thickness of ear was measured by a thickness gauge, scored by macroscopic observation, and graded against a standard that was obtained from the literature. Results showed that when compared with model group, medium and high doses of the TPL-nanoemulsion gels could significantly inhibit the degree of mice ear swelling (P < 0.01). The positive control drug also significantly inhibited the degree of mice ear swelling and skin erythematic; its role had no significant difference with the TPL-nanoemulsion gels. The low-dose group showed no significant difference compared with the model group. These results are shown in Table 4. They show that the moderate- and high-dose groups of the TPL-nanoemulsion gels can significantly improve the symptoms of dermatitis/eczema inflammation and edema erythematic in mice ears. Pathological examination found that, compared with the control group, the dermis skin of the model group rats was obviously thickening (edema) and that the dermis was full of a large number of infiltrating neutrophils and lymphocytes and included visible eosinophil infiltration. The drug treatment significantly reduces edema, and the infiltration of the inflammatory cells reduces accordingly (Fig. 10). The TPL-nanoemulsion gels can reduce rat’s ear inflammation that is pathological in the eczema mice model. However, comparing the thickness of the gastric mucosa shows that Tripterygium wilfordii tablets have more irrigation to control than the TPL-nanoemulsion gels does, and the TPL-nanoemulsion gels causes less gastrointestinal damage than the Tripterygium wilfordii tablets do. ","The sizes of TPL-nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels are 45.6 ± 1.7 and 62.1 ± 9.9 nm, respectively, both large than 36 nm, could be absorbed by trans-follicular routes or the aqueous pores.The TEM image of nanoemulsions clearly reveals a core–shell structure that is an evidence of the presence of two different compositions on the same droplet. The decrease of droplet size and the relative increase of the droplet surface area may increase the function of bioactive compounds encapsulated in the nanoemulsions. When droplet size is reduced, the ability of lipid interact with the biological membranes is also enhanced, thereby promoting their biological activity. In this article, encapsulating TPL in nanoemulsions may improve their availability and effectiveness. The drug may be wrapped in a hydrophobic interior or hydrophilic droplet surface, or both. As other literature reported, the smaller particle size appears to play a key role in maximizing the interface area of the encapsulated compounds to the aqueous phase. Kotyla etc. demonstrated that when compared to micronized emulsion preparations of this compound nanoemulsion system improved the bioavailability of the transdermal applied delta tocopherol. Bos etc. has raised that small molecule surfactants are widely used in the stability of nanoemulsion because of their absorbing ability in oil–water interface. They thought the small molecule surfactants are usually most suitable emulsifiers for producing the nanoemulsions because of their fast adsorption kinetics, low surface load and low interfacial tension. Jenning etc. also proposed the mechanism that nanocarriers’ action can be attributed to their association with skin surface. The size of the small particles ensured close contact with the stratum corneum. The number of capsules penetrated into the skin can promote drug transport by changing the keratin partition coefficient of the vehicle/stratum.Although the nanometer size and surface area plays a fundamental role in terms of increasing drug penetration, other nanoemulsion properties of the exciting agent type and concentration, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, as well as the nanoemulsions’ permeability membrane can also have the same effect. Other interesting nanoscale vehicles, are able to determine whether the drug’s osmotic enhancement or the effects of the drug on the skin. The surfactant on the skin surface expands the cuticle and the intact vesicle can penetrate the intact skin.In vitro release experiments results showed drug release from nano-formulations was slightly greater than that released from the ordinary gels. This disparity is most likely due to the structure of the nano-formulations, which exhibited higher solubilizations. Additionally, compared with the nanoemulsions, the nanoemulsion gels have a sudden release that is relatively slow and releases more drugs, because when the drug releases from the nanoemulsion gels, the drug comes out of the nanoemulsions before being released from the gels. During the experiment, the nanoemulsion gels released greater cumulative amounts of TPL than that released from the nanoemulsions. The enhanced drug release from the nanoemulsion gels formulations may be attributable to the drug repository that exists in this formulation that allows the nanoemulsion gels to sustain a stable release of the drug for longer and thus maintain effective drug concentrations to achieve better treatment for longer.For the mechanisms of the in vitro percutaneous permeation experiments, our results demonstrated that transform, especially in the nanoemulsions-treated and nanoemulsion gels-treated groups, the lipids, surfactants and co-surfactants in these vehicles may erode the stratum corneum and thereby disrupt the lipid arrangement. The stratum corneum of skin was loose and irregular, even resulted in a curly and deformed. The above mentioned two disruptive effects on the skin may have been exacerbated by this occlusive effect on the nanoscale lipid particles. Therefore, the carrier changed the skin, the interactions with the lipids and proteins in the stratum corneum, and the structure of the lipids in the skin; furthermore, the carrier improved the liquidity of the skin, changed the protein conformation and hydrated the keratin. This combination of interactions lowered the barrier function of the stratum corneum and promoted the percutaneous penetration of the contained drugs. In comparison with other vehicles, the enhanced transdermal permeation of drugs in the nanoemulsion gels and the nanoemulsions is mainly due to the more effective hydration of the stratum corneum, superior skin occlusion characteristics, and increased surface area with the skin corneocytes.The in vivo skin-vessel synchronous microdialysis experiment was carried out to study the pharmacokinetics of TPL. The drug concentrations at the application sites of the nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels increased first and then decreased, which implied similar patterns of percutaneous drug absorption for both of the nanometer formulations. The nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels cause occlusive effects and hydration of the stratum corneum that enhanced the transdermal drug permeation. Drug absorption can be enhanced by the formation of a lipid membrane that coalesces on the stratum corneum, allowing the drug to permeate into the skin. Moreover, the drug molecules must first be released from the nanoparticles before they can be absorbed, which may cause drug levels to fluctuate in the skin.The fluorescence analysis can be used to detected the location of a permeating molecule in skin epidermis and dermis. We found that coumarin-6 fluorescence was largely retained in the hair after laser exposure, revealing that substantial amounts of the drug passed through skin appendant organs such as hair follicles, to percutaneous absorption. At longer durations, a broad and continuous fluorescence band extended from the stratum corneum into the deeper layers of the epidermis. Fluorescence microscope showed the uniform fluorescence intensity in nano-therapy, and showed the high penetrability of nanoemulsion gels through goat skin, and enhanced the residue of the drug through the skin.","Nanoemulsions could be suitable for transdermal stably releasing drugs and maintaining the effective drug concentration. The TPL-nanoemulsion gels provided higher percutaneous amounts than other carriers did. The current results support the use of TPL-nanoemulsions and TPL-nanoemulsion gels as a technological platform for TPL delivery through the skin after topical administration. They influence skin, hydrating keratin and changing the structure of both the stratum corneum lipids and keratin. Both keratin hydration and the structural changes to the lipids and keratin can reduce the barrier function of the stratum corneum and thus promote the percutaneous penetration of the drug.The fluorescence photomicrograph of skin demonstrated that the fluorescence was mainly detected in the stratum corneum at first, then with obvious evidence of diffusion into the epidermis. In addition, the fluorescence was largely retained in the hair after laser exposure, revealing that substantial amounts of the drug passed through skin appending organs to percutaneous absorption, such as hair follicles. For pharmacodynamic study, the TPL-nanoemulsion gels have a good treatment effect on dermatitis/eczema in a mice model and is expected to provide a new, low-toxicity and long-term preparation for the clinical treatment of dermatitis/eczema in transdermal drug delivery systems."
98,TA043775,10.3390/molecules27196352,Production of Siamenoside I and Mogroside IV from Siraitia grosvenorii UsingImmobilized β-Glucosidase.,"Siraitia grosvenorii is a type of fruit used in traditional Chinese medicine.Previous studies have shown that the conversion of saponins was often carried outby chemical hydrolysis, which can be problematic because of the environmentalhazards it may cause and the low yield it produces. Therefore, the purpose ofthis study is to establish a continuous bioreactor with immobilized enzymes toproduce siamenoside I and mogroside IV. The results show that the immobilizationprocess of β-glucosidase exhibited the best relative activity with aglutaraldehyde (GA) concentration of 1.5%, carrier activation time of 1 h andbinding enzyme time of 12 h. After the immobilization through GA linkage, thehighest relative activity of β-glucosidase was recorded through the reaction withthe substrate at 60 °C and pH 5. Subsequently, the glass microspheres withimmobilized β-glucosidase were filled into the reactor to maintain the optimalactive environment, and the aqueous solution of Siraitia grosvenorii extract wasintroduced by controlling the flow rate. The highest concentration of siamenosideI and mogroside IV were obtained at a flow rate of 0.3 and 0.2 mL/min,respectively. By developing this immobilized enzyme system, siamenoside I andmogroside IV can be prepared in large quantities for industrial applications.","Chen, Hung-Yueh, Lin, Ching-Hsiang, Hou, Chih-Yao, Lin, Hui-Wen, Hsieh, Chang-Wei, Cheng, Kuan-Chen",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2,False,False,True,"Siraitia grosvenorii has been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal ingredient to treat lung fever and sore throat, etc. In addition to basic nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids and vitamins, Siraitia grosvenorii contains lots of flavonoids, phenols and terpenoids. These compounds represent the biochemical basis of Siraitia grosvenorii, which possesses various medicinal properties. Siraitia grosvenorii contains a proportion of saponins with cucurbitane-type triterpenoids called mogrosides that are composed of several glycosylated saccharides linked to the non-glycosyl moiety with β-bonds. Mogrosides have a number of biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-infection properties, etc., and have great potential to be developed into biopharmaceuticals. Among them, mogroside V is the main type making up the greatest proportion of content, accounting for about 0.8–1.3% (w/w). Compared with the other mogrosides, siamenoside I has a slightly lower physiological activity, but is the sweetest among all mogrosides. Mogroside IV and siamenoside I are two intermediate products upon mogroside V hydrolyzation, which is further hydrolyzed into mogroside IIIE by β-glucosidase.β-D-Glucosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.21) mainly catalyzes β-D-glucopyranosides from β-1,4 and β-1,6 of non-reducing sugar ends. β-D-Glucosidase is widely used in the food, medicine and biomass energy industries. The main principle is to use the process of hydrolysis to produce glucose and the required substances, such as those that engender better aroma in grape juice and red wine, or the daidzin and glycitin in soy milk are cleaved from the glycosidic bond to generate non-glycosidic daidzein and glycitein. The immobilized enzyme has the following characteristics: (1) the resistance to temperature and pH value is improved; (2) the storage stability is enhanced; (3) the enzyme can be reused in different reaction environments; and (4) the enzyme activity can be improved by reacting in an organic solvent.Since mogroside IV, mogroside V and siamenoside I have different physiological activities, in this study, in addition to optimizing the β-D-glucosidase immobilized system through an adjustment of immobilizing conditions, a continued bioreactor was designed to control the production of various mogrosides by simply adjusting the flow rate. The continued bioreactor is a type of packed bed reactor, which has been extensively applied in food manufacturing and processing for different purposes, such as hydrolyzing lactose in milk to produce lactose-free milk, hydrolyzing sucrose to produce syrup with higher fructose content, and clarifying apple juice.","Siraitia grosvenorii was purchased from Huang Changsheng Traditional Chinese Medicine Store in Taipei City. p-Nitrophenylglucopyranose (p-NPG), β-glucosidase, glass particles, sodium carbonate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, glutaraldehyde (GA), nitric acid, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (3-APES), formic acid, Bio-rad reagent, and hydrocorticoid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Methanol and ethanol were purchased from ECHO Chemical Co., Ltd. (Miaoli, Taiwan).To prepare carriers, glass microspheres were prepared following a modified version of the method by Chen et al.; a total weight of 2 g glass microspheres was first treated with 40 mL 10% nitric acid (HNO3) at 90 °C for 1 h, and then washed several times with distilled water. After the first treatment, glass microspheres were treated with 40 mL 10% 3-amino-propyltriethoxysilane (APES) aqueous solution at 70 °C for 3 h, then washed several times with distilled water and stored at 4 °C. For the activation of glass microspheres, modified version of the method by Chen et al. was used, a total weight of 2 g glass microspheres was treated with 1.5% (w/v) GA and stirred at 100 rpm at room temperature for 1 hr, then washed three times with distilled water. After activation, glass microspheres were treated with 1% (w/v) β-glucosidase solution at 4 °C for 12 h, then washed three times with 0.1 M phosphate buffer and stored at 4 °C. The concentration of immobilized β-glucosidase was calculated by the Bradford method.In this study, p-NPG was used as the substrate to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of β-glucosidase in various systems (with and without immobilization). The glass microspheres with and without β-glucosidase immobilization were dried by lyophilizer, then the surface morphologies were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Model JSM-6300, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV after gold sputtering. The covalent bonding between glass microspheres, GA and β-glucosidase was confirmed by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA, VG MICROTECH, MT-500, British).The determination of the optimal reaction temperature was evaluated by 0.5 mg/mL p-NPG as a substrate in pH 4 citric acid buffer at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 °C for 10 min. The optimal reaction pH value was examined by 0.5 p-NPG as a substrate at 60 °C in different pH values (from 4 to 8). The β-glucosidase activity was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 425 nm using a Multiskan GO microplate spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).To determine kinetic parameters of β-glucosidase, including K, τ50, τcomplete, the Michaels–Menten kinetic constant (Km) and maximal velocity (Vmax), different concentrations of p-NPG (from 0 to 20 mM) as the substrate for the reaction of free and immobilized β-glucosidase for different reaction times (from 0 to 90 min) were used. The parameters of K, τ50 and τcomplete represents the rate constant (min−1), the time required to reach required p-NPG and the time necessary to complete p-NPG, respectively. The β-glucosidase activity time curve fitted Equation (1), and the Vmax and Km were calculated based on the Lineweaver–Burk plot (Equation (2))  The evaluation of the storage stability was determined for the immobilized β-glucosidase activity for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 days storage at 4 °C. The reusability was determined by running reactions using immobilized β-glucosidase 10 times in 1 day. Both reusability and storage stability were reacted under the optimal conditions, and β-glucosidase activity in the first reaction and day 0 was a relative activity of 100%.As in the β-glucosidase immobilized bioreactor shown in Figure 5, the column was fixed by the rack. The outer layer of the column was connected to a constant temperature water bath to maintain the reaction temperature, and the inner layer was full the immobilized glass microspheres. For the β-glucosidase catalysis, three times volume of Siraitia grosvenorii extract was passed into the reactor from below and collected from above through the pump, the final product was collected in a bottle at 4 °C to terminate the enzyme activity.The extraction of Siraitia grosvenorii was performed using a modified version of the method by Zhang et al., Siraitia grosvenorii was broken by a grinder, screened by 60 mesh, and then stored at room temperature in the drying oven. To extract Siraitia grosvenorii, 15 g Siraitia grosvenorii powder was added to pH 5 citric acid buffer at 100 °C for 10 min, then filtered by suction and the supernatant stored as the Siraitia grosvenorii solution for subsequent use. For the bioreactor system, 27 mL Siraitia grosvenorii solution was added into the column at different flow rates (from 0.1 to 035 mL/min).The analytic process was modified according to Shen et al., the resolution of Siraitia grosvenorii extract, which included siamenoside I and mogroside IV, was performed by a YMC-Pack-ODS-AMC C18 column (5 mm, 250 × 4.6 mm) attached to a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system containing the pump (PU-2089, JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) and the analytical mixer. The results were analyzed using a SISC chromatography data system (SISC, New Taipei City, Taiwan). The detection was performed by UV absorption at 210 nm, and the injection volume and the elation rate were 20 mL and 0.6 mL/min, respectively. A 0.01% formic acid solution and methanol were used as the eluent.All experiments are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and performed at least in triplicate. The data analysis was measured using Prism, Minitab, Excel and Sigma plot, and the statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and Fisher’s LSD. The p-value was set at 0.05.","The β-glucosidase was immobilized on glass microspheres using glutaraldehyde (GA) as the cross-linker. To determine the situation of the immobilization, a scanning electronic microscope (SEM) was used to observe the surfaces of glass microspheres with and without β-glucosidase immobilization (Figure 1A–C). The interaction between carriers and the enzyme provides specific chemical, physical, biochemical and kinetic properties for each immobilized enzyme.In general, when the diameter of the carrier is smaller, the specific surface area will increase, resulting in more enzymes being immobilized. A carrier with a smaller size will reduce the diffusion limitation, which usually decreases the reduction of enzyme activity. The surfaces of glass microspheres without β-glucosidase were smooth and the average diameter was about 8 μm. After β-glucosidase immobilization through covalent binding with GA, the surfaces of glass microspheres became rough and granulated with a lot of flocci attached to them, as indicated by the red arrow. The morphology results showed that β-glucosidase was successfully immobilized on the glass microspheres through GA modification.Figure 1D,E shows the ESCA spectra of glass microspheres with and without β-glucosidase immobilization, which were used to investigate the chemical bonding between the enzyme and the carriers. The glass microspheres were cross-linked with the β-glucosidase using GA as the cross-linker. GA is a type of cross-linking agent that is commonly used due to its high commercial availability, colorlessness, low cost, water solubility and, most importantly, quick reaction with an amine group on an enzyme. Before immobilization, the characteristic signals at 284.6, 285.8, 286.2 and 288.9 eV corresponded to C-C, C=N, C-OH and C=O, respectively. After immobilization, the signal at 286.2 eV was reduced, and the signal at 285.8 eV was enhanced, which means that β-glucosidase was successfully linked on the surfaces of glass microspheres by GA and formed the Schiff base. According to the results, the β-glucosidase was successfully immobilized on the glass microspheres using GA as the cross-linker.Using GA as the crosslinker significantly affected the enzyme activity, which includes the GA concentration, the activation time and the coupling time. Figure 2A–C shows that β-glucosidase had the maximal relative activity, in which the GA concentration was 1.5%, the activation time was 1 h and the coupling time was 12 h. More GA concentration, activation time and coupling time may change the enzyme structure due to excessive crosslinking between GA and enzyme, which in turn decreases the enzyme activity.To optimize the catalytic activity, the reaction temperature and the pH value were considered, both of which significantly affected the enzyme activity. In order to determine the optimal reaction conditions for the immobilized system, the catalytic activity of β-glucosidase was evaluated at different reaction temperatures and pH values. The results for the reaction temperature show that the relative activity of β-glucosidase with and without immobilization was the same at 60 °C (Figure 2D). However, when the reaction temperature changed, the relative activity of the free enzyme changed more drastically than the immobilized enzyme, which means that the resistance to the reaction temperature was increased after enzyme immobilization. That may be because the immobilized enzyme reduced the flexibility and thermal vibration of the configuration, and then reduced the probability of protein denaturation. Just as the relative activity was recorded at its highest at the same reaction temperature of 60 °C both with and without immobilization, β-glucosidase also demonstrated the greatest relative activity at the same pH value of 5 under the two conditions (Figure 2E). Based on the results, a reaction temperature of 60 °C and a pH value at 5 were be used for subsequent experiments.The kinetic parameters, Vmax and Km represent the affinity between the enzyme and the substrate, which was calculated by the reaction time and the catalytic activity. These Michaelis–Menten kinetic constants are important characteristics to compare different enzyme systems. As shown in Figure 3 and Table 1, the Vmax and Km of free β-glucosidase were 5.15 mM/min and 2.36 mM, respectively, and the Vmax and Km of immobilized β-glucosidase were 1.04 mM/min and 3.31 mM, respectively. After enzyme immobilization, the Vmax was decreased, and the Km was increased due to changes in the enzyme structure and the diffusion limitation. Table 1 also shows the kinetic parameters of τ50 and τcomplete with and without immobilization, in which τ50 represents the time required for half of the reaction to complete and τcomplete represents the time required for the reaction to complete. Both parameters are calculated by plotting the relative activity at different reaction times. As shown in the results, the τ50 of the free enzyme was 1.33 min and the τcomplete was 4.43 min, whereas the τ50 of the immobilized enzyme is 6.43 min and the τcomplete is 21.36 min. The results of τ50 and τcomplete were similar to those for Vmax and Km, the catalytic time of immobilized β-glucosidase was increased. That was due to the diffusion limitation of immobilized β-glucosidase and the reduced probability of the substrate binding to the enzyme active site.Enzyme immobilization has attracted much attention in recent years, due to the enzyme storage stability and reusability reducing costs and increasing environmental sustainability. Figure 4A shows the results of the reusability of immobilized β-glucosidase by covalent bonding to glass microspheres as the carriers. The immobilized β-glucosidase still showed 80% relative activity after four catalysis reactions, and retained 50%.The parameters τ50 and τ100 represent the time needed to catalyze 50% and 100% of the p-NPG, respectively.Relative activity after 10 times of catalysis. Previous studies reported that the relative activity of β-glucosidase immobilized on chitosan was lower than 50% by reusing the reaction seven times. In contrast, β-glucosidase immobilized on glass microspheres effectively enhanced the enzyme activity. The catalytic activity of β-glucosidase was decreased in the subsequent cycles, due to the conformation changing of enzymes, the blocking of some reaction substrate, the loss of carriers and the removing of enzyme from carriers. The storage stability of immobilized β-glucosidase is shown in Figure 4B, the relative activity of immobilized β-glucosidase was above 90% after storage at 4 °C for 35 days, which indicates that this immobilization system maintained the superior stability and allowed long-term operation. These results suggest that β-glucosidase immobilized on the glass microspheres had increased storage stability and reusability, bearing out excellent potential for industrial applications.The β-glucosidase immobilized bioreactor was adopted according to the design diagram of the reactor (Figure 5A) and filled with glass microspheres, and the actual diagram is shown in Figure 5B. There are two types of bioreactor systems, namely suspension and immobilization. Some reactors use a combination of these two systems to achieve the best culture mode by taking into account the advantages of both, for example, immobilization of cells or enzymes on a carrier in a stirring, gas-lifting or bubbling reactors. Through comprehensive comparison of all types, the immobilization system known as a packed bed type is considered to be the most suitable for applications relating to enzyme reaction due to its design simplicity and low cost. The methodology used in a packed bed type involves fixing enzyme to carriers in the reactor’s column and allowing the reaction solution to flow from the bottom of the column to the top.The operation efficiency of a packed bed type reactor is high since the carrier is not subjected to mechanical shear force. Moreover, it is commonly used in enzyme-catalyzed reactions that consist of different phases of solid and liquid. The results of each flow rate to convert Siraitia grosvenorii extract into mogroside IV, mogroside V, mogroside IIIE, and siamenoside I are shown in Figure 6. The total amount of Siraitia grosvenorii extract at different flow rates had no significant enhancement, which means that the alteration and the catalysis of different Siraitia grosvenorii extracts had no inference from variables of this bioreactor design. For the mogroside V production, the amount of mogroside V was enhanced according to the increase in the flow rate. Given that mogroside V was the precursor of other mogrosides, the faster the flow rate (meaning the shorter the reaction time), the more mogroside V was produced. On the other hand, the production of mogroside IIIE as the final product was the opposite of mogroside V. The slower the flow rate (meaning the longer reaction time), the more mogroside IIIE was generated. In addition, the two intermediate products, siamenoside I and mogroside IV, had the highest production at flow rates of 0.3 mL/min and 0.2 mL/min, respectively. In conclusion, the production of these mogrosides, especially siamenoside I and mogroside IV, was significantly influenced by the flow rate, and the bioreactor designed in this experiment could control the flow rate to obtain two intermediates with higher conversion rates.",,"The optimal process for β-glucosidase immobilization was successfully developed with 1.5% GA concentration for 1 h activation, and coupled with β-glucosidase for 12 h. According to the results as presented, although the optimized conditions of both reaction temperature and pH value were not significantly affected by whether enzyme immobilization was carried out, the resistance of β-glucosidase to temperature was increased after immobilization. Moreover, the kinetic parameters of immobilized β-glucosidase were worse than free enzyme, due to the diffusion limitation and the conformation change after GA covalent bonding. Because of the advanced resistance to reaction conditions, the gainful storage stability of 35 days and the usability of more than 10 times were recorded. The increasing amount of research into mogrosides has pointed out that siamenoside I is 563 times sweeter than 5% sucrose aqueous solution and has a better flavor than other types of mogrosides, making it more suitable for use as a sweetener. Also, mogroside IV can slow down the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis and inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells, thus has great potential in the biopharmaceutical industry. In this study, the β-glucosidase immobilization was optimized by GA concentration, activation time, coupling time, reaction temperature and pH value. Moreover, this study establishes a β-glucosidase immobilization system for the continued reaction of different mogrosides by controlling the flow rate. Therefore, this immobilized β-glucosidase system has the potential to be applied in industry."

Undoubtedly, the main source of these metabolites is the red alga Laurencia viridis, endemic algae of the Canary Islands that grow on basaltic rocks in the lower intertidal zone at early spring when the coastal temperature is about 18 °C.

The third fraction (4.43 g) was chromatographed by a medium pressure silica gel chromatography Lobar LiChroprep-Si60with CH2Cl2:acetone (8:2) as eluent.

The solution was stirred for one hour at 40 °C and the resulting material was filtered off and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was chromatographed in HPLC (μ-Porasil column, n-Hex/AcOEt/MeOH14:5:1, flow rate 1 mL/min) to afford the 1,2-dehydropseudodehydrothyrsiferol 1.0 mg, (2.0 μmol). On other hand, To a mixture of dehydrothyrsiferol (1) (10 mg, 17 μmol) in 1 mL MeOH:H2O (1:1) was added AgNO3 (4.4 mg, 25.4 μmol) and the reaction solution was stirred for 30 min a room temperature. The resulting solution was filtered off and the 2 mL of MeOH:H2O was removed in vacuo. The crude oil was purified in HPLC (μ-Porasil column, CH2Cl2/MeOH 19:1, flow rate 0.5 mL/min) afforded 4.8 mg (9.1 μmol) of pseudodehydrothyrsiferol (6) 3.5 mg (6.5 μmol) of 2-methoxypseudodehydrothyrsiferol and 0.7 mg (1.3 μmol) of 2-dehydroxy-3-methoxypseudodehydrothyrsiferol.Jurkat (human T-cell acute leukaemia), MM144 (human multiple myeloma), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), and CADO-ES1 (human Ewing’s sarcoma) cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Jurkat, MM144, CADO-ES1) or DMEM (HeLa) culture medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in air containing 95% humidity and 5% CO2. Cells were periodically tested for Mycoplasma infection using the MycoAlert© Mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) as well as the Venor©GeM Advance Mycoplasma PCR detection Kit (Minerva Biolabs, Berlin, Germany), and found to be negative.The effect of compounds 1–5 in the proliferation of human tumor cell lines (cytostatic activity) was determined as previously described by using the XTT (sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4- tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate) cell proliferation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) as previously described. Cells (1.5–5.0 × 103 in 100 μL) were incubated in RPMI-1640 (Jurkat, MM144, CADO-ES-1) or DMEM (HeLa) culture medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, in the absence and in the presence of the indicated compounds at a concentration range of 10−4 to 10−9 M, in 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates, and following 72 h of incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of air/CO2 (19/1) the XTT assay was performed. Measurements were done in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated three times. The IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) value, defined as the drug concentration required to cause 50% inhibition in the cellular proliferation with respect to the untreated controls, was determined for each compound. Data are shown as means ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.Quantitation of apoptotic cells was calculated by fluorescence flow cytometry as the percentage of cells in the sub-G1/G0 region (hypodiploidy) in cell cycle analysis as previously described, by using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer (San Jose, CA, USA).","Iubol (2), was isolated as an amorphous white solid, [α]25 D +14.8 (c 0.27, CHCl3). The molecular formula, C30H51O6Br, determined by ESI-HRMS (m/z 609.3679/611.3607, [M + Na]+), turned out to be identical to that found for dehydrothyrsiferol (1). The structure of 2 was mainly determined from the analysis of its NMR data. Interpretation of its 1H and 13C NMR spectra together with the examination of the HSQC experiment showed that 2 consists of seven methyls, eleven methylenes, six methines and six quaternary carbons. Analysis of the 1H–1H COSY spectra enabled us to set five independent proton-proton spin systems, in a similar way to that found in other polyethers isolated from L. viridis. Specifically, the fragment C-1→C-18 of 2 closely resembles that of 1, with the presence of the same four spin systems: Fragment I [H-3 (δH 3.89), H2-4 (δH 2.10/2.24), H2-5 (δH 1.53/1.80)]; Fragment II [H-7 (δH 3.08), H2-8 (δH 1.45/1.72), H2-9 (δH 1.50/1.77)]; Fragment III [H-11 (δH 3.42), H2-12 (δH 1.63/1.78), H2-13 (δH 1.82/2.03), H-14 (δH 4.27)] and Fragment IV [H2-16 (δH 2.12/2.46), H2-17 (δH 1.38), H-18 (δH 3.30)] (Figure 2; Table 1). On the other hand, notable differences were found towards the terminal moiety of the molecule (C-19→C-24), where the COSY spectrum revealed coupling between the characteristic proton H-22 (δH 3.38) and H2-21 (δH 1.75) and these sequentially to both H2-20 (δH 1.50/1.79). Finally, the structure of 2 was unambiguously assigned by the HMBC correlations. Thus, significant correlations between methyl H3-29 (δH 1.18) with C-18 (δC 77.0), C-19 (δC 76.1) and C-20 (δC 27.9), as well as those of methyls H3-24 (δH 1.24) and H3-30 (δH 1.25) with C-22 (δC 75.2) and C-23 (δC 75.7), were observed (Figure 2).The high coincidence between the 1H and 13C NMR data of the C-1→C-14 fragment in 2 with those observed for 1 indicated that both compounds share the same relative configuration at C-3, C-6, C-7, C-10, C-11 and C-14 (Table 1). This conclusion was further supported by the analysis of the NOESY experiment, where identical correlations between 1 and 2 were observed. In particular, those connecting H-3 with H3-1 (δH 1.26), H-4α (δH 2.10) and H-5α (δH 1.53); H3-25 (δH 1.39) with H3-26 (δH 1.20) as well as H-11 with H-7 and H-14 together with those of H3-27 (δH 1.22) with H-8β (δH 1.45) and H-12β (δH 1.63) secured the relative configuration of this fragment. With regard to the C-18→C-24 fragment, when H-22 (δH 3.38, dd, J = 5.1, 10.5 Hz) was selectively irradiated in the 1D-gNOESYexperiment, only H3-29 and H3-24 showed enhancements indicating that all protons are on the same side of the tetrahydropyran ring. From these coupling constant values and NOESY correlations we concluded that only a twist-boat conformation with 19R*, 22R* relative configuration is possible for the D ring, as shown in Figure 3.From a biogenetic viewpoint, most of the polyoxygenated squalene-derived ethers isolated from Laurencia species seem to arise from a common precursor: the (10R,11R)-squalene 10,11-epoxide isolated from L. okamurai. This compound can evolve to (6S,7S,10R,11R,14R,15R,18S,19S)-squalene tetraepoxide as a common intermediate. Therefore, the new tetrahydropyran ring found in 2 could be biosynthesised from the diepoxide fragment 18S, 19S, 22R by protonation of the (20R)-epoxide followed by hydroxylation at C-23 yielding 18S, 19S-epoxy-20R-hydroxy as intermediate. The subsequent cyclization process with configuration inversion at C-19 would give the 18S*, 19R*, 22R* relative configuration as illustrated in Figure 4. Importantly, this hypothesis is consistent with the experimental data used to proffer the relative configuration of C-19 and C-22 offering simultaneously a solution for the configuration of C-18.22-Hydroxy-15(28)-dehydrovenustatriol (3), was obtained as an amorphous white solid, [α]25 D +15.2 (c 0.07, CHCl3). The molecular formula of 3, C30H51O7Br, deduced by ESI-HRMS (m/z 625.2695/627.2723, [M + Na]+), indicated the presence of an additional oxygen atom with respect to dehydrothyrsiferol (1). Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data of 3 with those reported for 1 clearly revealed that 3 shares the same carbon skeleton with 1, but contains an additional oxygen atom at the C-19→C-24 moiety (Table 2). Thus, a detailed analysis of the 1H–1H COSY and HSQC spectra confirmed the existence of the same four 1H–1H spin systems (Fragments I–IV) observed in the C-1→C-18 portion of 1 (Figure 5). However, in contrast with 1, the terminal moiety of the molecule contains only a four-proton spin system formed by H2-20 (δH 2.00) and H2-21 (δH 1.80/1.91), missing the characteristic H-22 signal. Finally, we used the HMBC experiment to connect the new and characteristic 13C signal of C-22 (δC 112.5) with H2-20 (δH 2.00), H3-24 (δH 1.29) and H3-30 (δH 1.31). In addition those correlations observed between H3-29 (δH 1.44) and C-18 (δC 84.8), C-19 (δC 86.9) and C-20 (δC 29.3) allowed us to build up the structure of the C-18→C-24 portion of 3.Comparison of the 3JH–H coupling constants, 1H and 13C chemical shifts together with a detailed analysis of the NOESY experiment established the relative configuration of the C-1→C-14 fragment in 3 as identical to dehydrothyrsiferol (1). However, the absence of NOE correlations between H3-29 with H3-24 and H3-30, excluded any definitive conclusion although it clearly suggests a trans configuration for this oxolane ring. The relative configuration of this moiety can be proposed making use of a biogenetic hypothesis. Thus, the presence of a hemiacetal group at C-22 can be rationalized via an intermediate with a carbonyl group at C-22 and by the subsequent cyclization as represented in Figure 4. Again, assuming that the biogenesis starts with a common precursor for all the oxaqualenoids isolated from Laurencia, the most plausible configuration for the stereogenic centers of this fragment should be 18R*, 19S* and 22R*.Two additional related compounds, 1,2-dehydropseudodehydrothyrsiferol (4) and secodehydrothyrsiferol (5) were isolated in this study. Analysis of their ESI-HRMS spectra allowed us to establish their molecular formulas as C30H50O6 and C30H50O8 respectively. Comparison of the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of 1,2-dehydropseudodehydrothyrsiferol (4) with other related compounds revealed great similarities with those reported for pseudodehydrothyrsiferol (6) except at the C-1→C-3 portion of the molecule (Tables 2 and 3). In fact, analysis of the 2D NMR spectra led us to the same carbon skeleton. However, the observation of HMBC correlations between the methylene protons H2-1 (δH 4.77/4.99) with C-2 (δC 145.3), C-3 (δC 83.2) and C-25 (δC 17.2) clearly indicated that the differences between 4 and 6 were due to the dehydration of the hydroxyl group attached to C-2 in 6, that yielded an exocyclic double bond at C-1→C-2 in 4 (Figure 6). With regard to secodehydrothyrsiferol (5), the NMR data showed changes with respect to 6 around the C-1→C-6 fragment. The 1H NMR spectrum revealed the existence of two new methyl groups as well as one methylene located at α-carbonyl positions. In addition, two new carbonyl groups (one ketone and one ester) were easily detected from the 13C NMR spectrum. Therefore, the structure of 5 was determined on the basis of the connectivity observed between H2-4 (δH 2.50) and H2-5 (δH 2.16/2.26) in the COSY experiment together with the HMBC correlations of H3-25 (δH 2.15) and H2-4 with C-3 (δC 208.5), those of H3-1 (δH 1.98) with C-2 (δC 170.1) and C-6 (δC 84.1) as well as those of H3-26 (δH 1.39) with C-5 (δC 29.3), C-6 (δC 84.1) and C-7 (δC 80.0). Comparison of the 1H and 13C chemical shifts, 3JH–H coupling constants, together with an analysis of the ROESY experiments of 4 and 5 showed very similar results compared to those of compound 6, and therefore the same relative configuration is proposed for the new compounds. An important feature in 4 and 5 is the absence of the bromine atom in ring A as it is common in the thyrsiferol or venustatriol series. Thus, the biogenetic origin of both compounds could be rationalized by attack of the oxane oxygen to the C-3 position that bears a bromine atom via a 5-exo process, giving an oxonium ion intermediate that would evolve as shown in Figure 7 to yield both metabolites. The biogenetic origin of 5 could be rationalized by a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. These rearrangements have been confirmed experimentally in many cases and are almost always consistent with the participation of an oxonium ion intermediate. In order to confirm the previous proposal, we induced this rearrangement in dehydrothyrsiferol (1). Therefore, 1 was treated with AgNO3 using either methanol:water (1:1) or anhydrous acetonitrile as solvents. In the first case, using a methanol:water (1:1) mixture, the reaction yielded pseudodehydrothyrsiferol (6) as well as the methoxy derivatives at C-2 and C-3 positions. The relative yields of this reaction could be modulated changing the methanol:water ratio. On the other hand, when an aprotic solvent was used, three compounds showing m/z of 506 were identified by LC-MS although the main product was 1,2-dehydropseudodehydrothyrsiferol (4).This class of polyether squalene natural products shows a variety of biological properties where its cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells is highly significant. Therefore, the in vitro cytostatic activity of 1–5 was assessed by XTT assays, using several human cancer cell lines, including Jurkat (human T-cell acute leukemia), MM144 (human multiple myeloma), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), and CADO-ES1 (human Ewing’s sarcoma). As shown in Table 4, Jurkat leukemic cells were the most sensitive cells to the tested polyether compounds. In particular, iubol (2), 22-hydroxy-15(28)-dehydrovenustatriol (3), and secodehydrothyrsiferol (5) showed the highest effectiveness against this cell line (IC50, 2.0–3.5 μM). The capacity of the above compounds to inhibit cell proliferation was likely due to their ability to induce apoptosis, as assessed by the appearance of a sub-G1/G0 subpopulation in cell cycle analysis, indicative of DNA breakdown, following incubation of Jurkat cells with 5 (Figure 8).Interestingly, the substitution of an H atom in 1 by a hydroxyl group in 3 at C-22 highly potentiated the cytostatic activity (Table 4). It is also noteworthy that all the above compounds were active against the CADO-ES1 human Ewing’s sarcoma cell line (Table 4) in the range of 10–12 μM, suggesting that this type of compound could be suitable in the search for therapeutic lead compounds against both sarcoma and T-cell leukemia malignancies. Doxorubicin, used as a positive control rendered IC50 values in the order of 10−7–10−8 M (data not shown).",,
