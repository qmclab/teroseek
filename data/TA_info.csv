1658,TA002010,10.3390/molecules25112589,Mutagenesis and Adaptation of the Psychrotrophic Fungus Chrysosporium pannorumA-1 as a Method for Improving β-pinene Bioconversion.,"Mutagenesis and adaptation of the psychrotrophic fungus Chrysosporium pannorumA-1 to the toxic substrate β-pinene were used to obtain a biocatalyst withincreased resistance to this terpene and improved bioconversion properties.Mutants of the parental strain were induced with UV light andN-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Mutants resistant to β-pinene were isolatedusing agar plates with a linear gradient of substrate concentrations. Activemutants were selected based on their general metabolic activity (GMA) expressedas oxygen consumption rate. Compared to the parental strain, the most activemutant showed an enhanced biotransformation ability to convert β-pinene totrans-pinocarveol (315 mg per g of dry mycelium), a 4.3-fold greater biocatalyticactivity, and a higher resistance to H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress.Biotransformation using adapted mutants yielded twice as much trans-pinocarveolas the reaction catalyzed by non-adapted mutants. The results indicate thatmutagenesis and adaptation of C. pannorum A-1 is an effective method of enhancingβ-bioconversion of terpenes.","Kutyła, Mateusz, Fiedurek, Jan, Gromada, Anna, Jędrzejewski, Krzysztof, Trytek, Mariusz",2020,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
1828,TA002243,10.3390/ijms22020605,Biochemical Characterization and Function of Eight Microbial Type TerpeneSynthases from Lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii.,"Selaginella moellendorffii is a lycophyte, a member of an ancient vascular plantlineage. Two distinct types of terpene synthase (TPS) genes were identified fromthis species, including S. moellendorffii TPS genes (SmTPSs) and S.moellendorffii microbial TPS-like genes (SmMTPSLs). The goal of this study was toinvestigate the biochemical functions of SmMTPSLs. Here, eight full-lengthSmMTPSL genes (SmMTPSL5, -15, -19, -23, -33, -37, -46, and -47) were functionallycharacterized from S. moellendorffii. Escherichia coli-expressed recombinantSmMTPSLs were tested for monoterpenes synthase and sesquiterpenes synthaseactivities. These enzymatic products were typical monoterpenes and sesquiterpenesthat have been previous shown to be generated by typical plant TPSs when providedwith geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrates.Meanwhile, SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 were up-regulated when induced by alamethicin(ALA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), suggesting a role for these genes in plantsresponse to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, this study pointed out that theterpenoids products of SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 have an antibacterial effect onPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and Staphylococcus aureus. Taken together,these results provide more information about the catalytic and biochemicalfunction of SmMTPSLs in S. moellendorffii plants.","Zhao, Yapei, Hu, Tian, Liu, Ruiqi, Hao, Zhiqiang, Liang, Guoyan, Li, Guanglin",2021,International journal of molecular sciences,2

METHODS: Thin film hydration method was used to prepareterpesomes according to a 3(2) full factorial design to inspect the effect ofseveral variables on vesicles' features. The investigated factors were terpenestype (X(1)) and terpenes amount (X(2)) while the dependent responses wereencapsulation efficiency percent (Y(1)), particle size (Y(2)) and polydispersityindex (Y(3)). Design Expert(®) program was used to chose the best achievedformula. The selected terpesomes were further optimized via incorporation of apositive charge inducer (stearylamine) to enhance adhesion to the negativelycharged mucus covering the eye surface. The in vivo performance of the optimizedfenticonazole nitrate-loaded terpesomes relative to drug suspension was evaluatedby measuring the antifungal activity (against Candida albicans) retained in thetear's fluid at different time intervals after ocular application in albinorabbits. RESULTS: The optimized terpesomes showed spherical vesicles withentrapment efficiency of 79.02±2.35%, particle size of 287.25±9.55 nm,polydispersity index of 0.46±0.01 and zeta potential of 36.15±1.06 mV. The invivo study demonstrated significantly higher ocular retention of the optimizedfenticonazole nitrate-loaded terpesomes relative to the drug suspension.Moreover, the histopathological studies proved the safety and biocompatibility ofthe prepared terpesomes. CONCLUSION: The obtained results verified the potentialof the terpesomes for safe and effective ocular delivery of fenticonazolenitrate.","Albash, Rofida, Al-Mahallawi, Abdulaziz Mohsen, Hassan, Mariam, Alaa-Eldin, Ahmed Adel",2021,International journal of nanomedicine,2
1982,TA002480,10.3390/metabo14090472,The Legacy Effect of Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreaks on the Chemical andAnatomical Defences of Surviving Lodgepole Pine Trees.,"The recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks have caused widespread mortality amonglodgepole pine trees in western North America, resulting in a reduced populationof surviving trees. While previous studies have focused on the cascading impactsof these outbreaks on the physiology and growth of the surviving trees, thereremains a need for a comprehensive study into the interactions among variousphysiological traits and the growth in post-outbreak stands. Specifically, therelationship between chemical (primarily terpenes) and anatomical (mainly resinducts) defences, as well as the allocation of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs)to support these defence modalities, is poorly understood. To address these gaps,we conducted a field survey of surviving lodgepole pine trees in post-mountainpine beetle outbreak stands in western Canada. Our retrospective analysis aimedat determining correlations between the post-outbreak concentrations ofmonoterpenes, diterpenes, and NSCs in the phloem and the historical resin ductcharacteristics and growth traits before and after the outbreak. We detectedstrong correlations between the post-outbreak concentrations of monoterpenes andhistorical resin duct characteristics, suggesting a possible link between thesetwo defence modalities. Additionally, we found a positive relationship betweenthe NSCs and the total concentrations of monoterpenes and diterpenes, suggestingthat NSCs likely influence the production of these terpenes in lodgepole pine.Furthermore, historical tree growth patterns showed strong positive correlationswith many individual monoterpenes and diterpenes. Interestingly, while survivingtrees had enhanced anatomical defences after the outbreak, their growth patternsdid not vary before and after the outbreak conditions. The complexity of theserelationships emphasizes the dynamics of post-outbreak stand dynamics andresource allocations in lodgepole pine forests, highlighting the need for furtherresearch. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of coniferdefences and their coordinated responses to forest insect outbreaks, withimplications for forest management and conservation strategies.","Baker, Gigi, Zhao, Shiyang, Klutsch, Jennifer G, Ishangulyyeva, Guncha, Erbilgin, Nadir",2024,Metabolites,2

Growth experiments indicated the formationof geraniol and geranial. Thus, a 3,1-hydroxyl-Δ(1)-Δ(2)-mutase (linaloolisomerase) activity may initiate the degradation, followed by enzymes of theacyclic terpene utilization (Atu) and leucine/isovalerate utilization (Liu)pathways that were extensively studied in Pseudomonas spp. growing on citronellolor geraniol. RESULTS: A transposon mutagenesis yielded 39 transconjugants thatcould not grow anaerobically on linalool and nitrate in liquid medium. Thedeficiencies were apparently based on gene functions required to overcome thetoxicity of linalool, but not due to inactivation of genes in the degradationpathway. Growing cultures formed geraniol and geranial transiently, but alsogeranic acid. Analysis of expressed proteins detected several enzymes of the Atuand Liu pathways. The draft genome of T. linaloolentis 47Lol(T) had atu and liugenes with homology to those of Pseudomonas spp.. CONCLUSION: The in comparisonto monoterpenes larger toxicity of monoterpene alcohols is defeated by severalmodifications of the cellular structure and metabolism in Thauera linaloolentis47Lol(T). The acyclic terpene utilization pathway is used in T. linaloolentis47Lol(T) during growth on (R,S)-linalool and nitrate under anoxic conditions.This is the first experimental verification of an active Atu pathway outside ofthe genus Pseudomonas.","Marmulla, Robert, Cala, Edinson Puentes, Markert, Stephanie, Schweder, Thomas, Harder, Jens",2016,BMC microbiology,2

In particular,some Eucalyptus species have currently shown cytotoxic properties. LocalBrazilian communities have used leaves of E. benthamii as a herbal remedy forvarious diseases, including cancer. Considering the lack of available data forsupporting this cytotoxic effect, the goal of this paper was to study the invitro cytotoxic potential of the essential oils from young and adult leaves of E.benthamii and some related terpenes (α-pinene, terpinen-4-ol, and γ-terpinene) onJurkat, J774A.1 and HeLa cells lines. Regarding the cytotoxic activity based onMTT assay, the essential oils showed improved results than α-pinene andγ-terpinene, particularly for Jurkat and HeLa cell lines. Terpinen-4-ol revealeda cytotoxic effect against Jurkat cells similar to that observed for volatileoils. The results of LDH activity indicated that cytotoxic activity of samplesagainst Jurkat cells probably involved cell death by apoptosis. The decrease ofcell DNA content was demonstrated due to inhibition of Jurkat cells proliferationby samples as a result of cytotoxicity. In general, the essential oils from youngand adult leaves of E. benthamii presented cytotoxicity against the investigatedtumor cell lines which confirms their antitumor potential.","Döll-Boscardin, Patrícia Mathias, Sartoratto, Adilson, Sales Maia, Beatriz Helena Lameiro de Noronha, Padilha de Paula, Josiane, Nakashima, Tomoe, Farago, Paulo Vitor, Kanunfre, Carla Cristine",2012,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2

6557,TA011734,10.1002/cbic.202100465,Engineering of a Plant Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthase for Development ofIrregular Coupling Activity.,"We performed mutagenesis on a regular isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (IDS), neryldiphosphate synthase from Solanum lycopersicum (SlNPPS), that has a structurallyrelated analogue performing non-head-to-tail coupling of two dimethylallyldiphosphate (DMAPP) units, lavandulyl diphosphate synthase from Lavandula xintermedia (LiLPPS). Wild-type SlNPPS catalyses regular coupling of isopentenyldiphosphate (IPP) and DMAPP in cis-orientation resulting in the formation ofneryl diphosphate. However, if the enzyme is fed with DMAPP only, it is able tocatalyse the coupling of two DMAPP units and synthesizes two irregularmonoterpene diphosphates; their structures were elucidated by the NMR analysis oftheir dephosphorylation products. One of the alcohols is lavandulol. The secondcompound is the trans-isomer of planococcol, the first example of an irregularcyclobutane monoterpene with this stereochemical configuration. The irregularactivity of SlNPPS constitutes 0.4 % of its regular activity and is revealed onlyif the enzyme is supplied with DMAPP in the absence of IPP. The exchange ofasparagine 88 for histidine considerably enhanced the non-head-to-tail coupling.While still only observed in the absence of IPP, irregular activity of the mutantreaches 13.1 % of its regular activity. The obtained results prove that regularIDS are promising starting points for protein engineering aiming at thedevelopment of irregular activities and leading to novel monoterpene structures.","Gerasymenko, Iryna, Sheludko, Yuriy V, Navarro Fuertes, Ismael, Schmidts, Volker, Steinel, Lara, Haumann, Elisabeth, Warzecha, Heribert",2022,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,2

However, the specific effects and molecular mechanisms of T4Oon pancreatic cancer (PC) cells remain largely unknown. In this study, wedemonstrated that T4O markedly suppressed PC cell proliferation and colonyformation in vitro and induced apoptosis. Similarly, T4O significantly inhibitedthe migration and invasion of PC cells in vitro. Through RNA sequencing, 858differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, which were enriched in theRhodopsin (RHO)/ Ras homolog family member A (RHOA) signaling pathway.Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2), a DEG enriched inthe RHO/RHOA signaling pathway, was considered as a key target of T4O in PCcells; it was significantly reduced after T4O treatment, highly expressed in PCtissues, and negatively associated with patient outcome. Overexpression of ROCK2significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of T4O on PC cell proliferation andmobility. Moreover, T4O inhibited cell proliferation in vivo and decreased theKi-67, cell nuclear antigen, EMT markers, and ROCK2 expression. In conclusion, weconsider that T4O can suppress the malignant biological behavior of PC byreducing the expression of ROCK2, thus contributing to PC therapy.","Cao, Wenpeng, Tian, Ruhua, Pan, Runsang, Sun, Baofei, Xiao, Chaolun, Chen, Yunhua, Zeng, Zhirui, Lei, Shan",2022,Bioengineered,2
10711,TA019019,10.3390/insects10040118,Volatiles from Different Instars of Honeybee Worker Larvae and Their Food.,"(E)-β-Ocimene was the only volatile chemical found to be emitted by whole, liveworker larvae of Apis mellifera L. when sampling in the vapor phase. In additionto (E)-β-ocimene, there is evidence for the existence of other volatiles, but thechanges in their composition and contents remain unknown during larvaldevelopment, as are their differences from larvae to larval food. We investigatedvolatile components of worker larvae and larval food using solid phase dynamicextraction (SPDE) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Ninecompounds were identified with certainty and six tentatively, includingterpenoids, aldehydes, hydrocarbons, an ester and a ketone. The contents ofvolatiles in the second-instar worker larvae differ greatly from those in larvaeof other stages. This is mainly attributable to terpenoids, which resulted in thesecond-instar worker larvae having significantly higher amounts of overallvolatiles. Larval food contained significantly higher amounts of aldehydes andhydrocarbons than the corresponding larvae from the fourth to fifth-instar. Wediscovered volatiles in worker larvae and their food that were never reportedbefore; we also determined the content changes of these volatiles during larvaldevelopment.","Zhang, Haohao, Hou, Chunsheng, Dai, Pingli, Liu, Yongjun, Wu, Yanyan, Pang, Yonggang, Diao, Qingyun",2019,Insects,2

Costunolide (CTL) is a natural sesquiterpenelactone with wide pharmacological activities including anti-inflammation andantioxidation. In this study, we found that CTL significantly inhibited theproduction of inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide, IL-6, TNF-α, andPGE2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia. Moreover, CTLeffectively attenuated IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway activation. To identifydirect cellular target of CTL, we performed high-throughput reverse virtualscreening assay using scPDB protein structure library, and found cyclin-dependentkinase 2 (CDK2) was the most specific binding protein for CTL. We furtherconfirmed the binding ability of CTL with CDK2 using cellular thermal shift assay(CETSA) and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assays. Surfaceplasmon resonance analysis also supported that CTL specifically bound to CDK2with a dissociation constant at micromole level. Furthermore, knocking down CDK2obviously reversed the anti-inflammation effect of CTL via AKT/IKKβ/NF-κBsignaling pathway on BV-2 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that CTLinhibits microglia-mediated neuroinflammation through directly targeting CDK2,and provide insights into the role of CDK2 as a promising anti-neuroinflammationtherapeutic target.","Liu, Yan-Chen, Feng, Na, Li, Wei-Wei, Tu, Peng-Fei, Chen, Jian-Ping, Han, Jing-Yan, Zeng, Ke-Wu",2020,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

Root mycorrhizal fungal colonization varied from 70% undersoil drought to 85% under soil well-watered, and shoot and root biomass wasincreased by AMF inoculation, independent of soil water regimes. A total of 643secondary metabolites in roots were examined, and 210 and 105 differentialmetabolites were regulated by mycorrhizal fungi under normal water and droughtstress, along with 88 and 17 metabolites being up-and down-regulated underdrought conditions, respectively. KEGG annotation analysis of differentialmetabolites showed 38 and 36 metabolic pathways by mycorrhizal inoculation undernormal water and drought stress conditions, respectively. Among them, 33metabolic pathways for mycorrhization under drought stress included purinemetabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism,etc. We also identified 10 terpenoid substances, namely albiflorin, artemisinin(-)-camphor, capsanthin, β-caryophyllene, limonin, phytol, roseoside, sweroside,and α-terpineol. AMF colonization triggered the decline of almost alldifferential terpenoids, except for β-caryophyllene, which was up-regulated bymycorrhizas under drought, suggesting potential increase in volatile organiccompounds to initiate plant defense responses.

The current reportdescribes the draft genome and four transcriptomes of A. indica and attempts tocontextualise the sequence information in terms of its molecular phylogeny,transcript expression and terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. A. indica is the firstmember of the family Meliaceae to be sequenced using next generation sequencingapproach. RESULTS: The genome and transcriptomes of A. indica were sequencedusing multiple sequencing platforms and libraries. The A. indica genome isAT-rich, bears few repetitive DNA elements and comprises about 20,000 genes. Themolecular phylogenetic analyses grouped A. indica together with Citrus sinensisfrom the Rutaceae family validating its conventional taxonomic classification.Comparative transcript expression analysis showed either exclusive or enhancedexpression of known genes involved in neem terpenoid biosynthesis pathwayscompared to other sequenced angiosperms. Genome and transcriptome analyses in A.indica led to the identification of repeat elements, nucleotide composition andexpression profiles of genes in various organs. CONCLUSIONS: This study on A.indica genome and transcriptomes will provide a model for characterization ofmetabolic pathways involved in synthesis of bioactive compounds, comparativeevolutionary studies among various Meliaceae family members and help annotatetheir genomes.

Species that pull ACP away fromcommercial citrus plants have been identified, and transgenic plants that repelACP have been developed. The concept of a repellent-producing plant was firstdemonstrated with an Arabidopsis line engineered to overexpress a genecontrolling the synthesis of β-caryophyllene and other sesquiterpenes. We haveanalyzed the volatile organic compounds released by this Arabidopsis line andidentified α-humulene, α-copaene, and trace amounts of β-elemene, in addition toβ-caryophyllene. Behavioral measurements demonstrated that α-copaene repels ACPat doses ca. 100× lower than those needed for β-caryophyllene repellence. Incontrast, α-humulene is innocuous at the level emitted by the transgenic plant.We confirmed that a mixture of the three sesquiterpenes in the ratio 1:100:10repels ACP.

Due tooverharvesting, N. scrophulariiflora resources are facing the risk of depletion,urgently requiring resource protection and rational utilization. However, thebiosynthetic pathways and related genes of active compounds in N.scrophulariiflora have not been fully investigated. In this study, widelytargeted metabolomics and RNA-seq technology were employed to perform a jointanalysis of the metabolome and transcriptome in different tissues of N.scrophulariiflora, including the roots, stems, and leaves. A total of 196flavonoids and 63 terpenoids were identified. Among the 158,254 annotated genes,74 were annotated as related to iridoid synthesis. Using bioinformatics methodssuch as clustering analysis, phylogenetic tree construction, and weighted geneco-expression network analysis (WGCNA), 43 candidate genes were identified thatmay be involved in the biosynthesis of picroside-I and picroside-II, of which 26genes were significantly correlated with the synthesis of picrosides and theirintermediates. Transcriptome analysis revealed the expression patterns ofdifferentially expressed genes, and metabolomic analysis revealed thedistribution characteristics of metabolites in different tissues of N.scrophulariiflora.

The resultsshowed that EOs from sweet lemon, mandarin, lime, and orange showed highersolubility (79.5% to 93.5%) when encapsulated with GA/MD. Likewise, EOs fromsweet lemon showed the highest phenolic content when using GA/CAS (228.27 mgGAE/g sample), and the encapsulated EOs of sweet lemon and mandarin withGA/MD/CAS (1709 and 1599 μmol TE/g) had higher antioxidant capacity. On the otherhand, higher encapsulation efficiency was obtained in EOs of lime encapsulatedwith GA/MD (68.5%), and the nanoencapsulates of EOs from sweet lemon with GA/MDhad higher D-limonene content (613 ng/mL). Using gum arabic and maltodextrinincreased the encapsulation efficiency and D-limonene content in EO of sweetlemon.

Hecogeninacetate (HA) is a steroidal sapogenin-acetylated that produces antinociceptiveactivity. Thus, we evaluate the antihyperalgesic profile of HA in mice ininflammatory models, as well as its possible involvement with c-fos expression onspinal cord area and cytokines to produces analgesic profile. Acute pretreatmentwith HA (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg; i.p.) inhibited the development of mechanicalhyperalgesia induced by carrageenan, TNF-α, dopamine and PGE2. Additionally, theimmunofluorescence data demonstrated that acute pretreatment with HA, at alldoses tested, significantly inhibited Fos-like expression in the spinal corddorsal horn normally observed after carrageenan-inflammation. Moreover, HA didnot affect the motor performance of the mice as tested in the Rota rod test. Thisantinociceptive profile seems to be related, at least in part, to a reduction ofpro-inflammatory cytokines, as IL-1β. The present results suggest that HAattenuates mechanical hyperalgesia by blocking the neural transmission of pain atthe spinal cord levels and by cytokines-inhibitory mechanisms.","Quintans, Jullyana S S, Barreto, Rosana S S, de Lucca, Waldecy Jr, Villarreal, Cristiane F, Kaneto, Carla M, Soares, Milena B P, Branco, Alexsandro, Almeida, Jackson R G S, Taranto, Alex G, Antoniolli, Angelo R, Freitas, Rivelilson M, Quintans, Lucindo J Jr",2014,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

However, 1,25D3 doses required fordifferentiation of AML cells may cause lethal hypercalcemia in vivo. There isevidence that vitamin D₂ is less toxic than vitamin D₃ in animals. Here, wedetermined the differentiation effects of novel analogs of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitaminD₂ (1,25D2), PRI-1916 and PRI-1917, in which the extended side chains of theirpreviously reported precursors (PRI-1906 and PRI-1907, respectively) underwentfurther 24Z (24-cis) modification. Using four human AML cell lines representingdifferent stages of myeloid maturation (KG-1a, HL60, U937, and MOLM-13), we foundthat the potency of PRI-1916 was slightly higher or equal to that of PRI-1906while PRI-1917 was significantly less potent than PRI-1907. We also demonstratedthat 1,25D2 was a less effective differentiation agent than 1,25D3 in these celllines. Irrespective of their differentiation potency, all the vitamin D₂derivatives tested were less potent than 1,25D3 in transactivating the DR3-typevitamin D response elements. However, similar to 1,25D3, both 1,25D2 and itsanalogs could strongly cooperate with the plant polyphenol carnosic acid ininducing cell differentiation and inhibition of G1-S cell cycle transition. Theseresults indicate that the 24Z modification has contrasting effects on thedifferentiation ability of PRI-1906 and PRI-1907 and that the addition of a plantpolyphenol could result in a similar extent of cell differentiation induced bydifferent vitamin D compounds. The enhanced antileukemic effects of the testedcombinations may constitute the basis for the development of novel approaches fordifferentiation therapy of AML.","Nachliely, Matan, Sharony, Ehud, Bolla, Narasimha Rao, Kutner, Andrzej, Danilenko, Michael",2016,International journal of molecular sciences,2

Suppression of microglial activation and the resultingproduction of proinflammatory molecules are considered a promising strategy toalleviate the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Triptolide wasdemonstrated as a potent anti-inflammatory compound both in vitro and in vivo.The present study explored potential signal pathways of triptolide in thelipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response using primary ratmicroglial cells. FINDINGS: Microglial cells were pretreated with triptolide andstimulated with LPS. To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of triptolide,we used Griess reagent and Western blot for NO release and iNOS expression,respectively. Moreover, we applied microglia-conditioned medium to neuronal cellsand used the MTS assay to test cell viability. We found that triptolide inhibitedLPS-induced NO and iNOS synthesis in microglial cells, which in turn protectedneurons. To evaluate the involvement of the EP2 pathway, we used real-time PCRand Western blot to determine EP2 expression. We found that LPS induced a largeincrease in EP2 expression in microglia, and triptolide almost completelyinhibited LPS-induced EP2 expression. Using the selective EP2 agonist butaprostand the EP2 antagonist AH6809, we determined that triptolide inhibitedLPS-stimulated NO production in microglia mainly through the EP2 pathway.Additionally, by further treating triptolide-treated microglia with thedownstream PKA-specific activator 6-Bnz-cAMP or the Epac-specific activator8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP, we found that 6-Bnz-cAMP but not 8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP increasedNO production in triptolide-LPS treated microglia. These results indicate thatthe EP2-PKA pathway is very important for triptolide's effects. CONCLUSIONS:Triptolide inhibits LPS-stimulated NO production in microglia via a signalingmechanism involving EP2 and PKA. This finding may help establish thepharmacological function of triptolide in neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover,the observation of inflammatory EP2 signaling in primary microglia providesimportant evidence that EP2 regulates innate immunity in the central nervoussystem.","Zhang, Ting, Gong, Xiaoli, Hu, Guanzheng, Wang, Xiaomin",2015,Journal of neuroinflammation,2

Among which, escin Ia showed morepotent inhibition of the invasion than other five main saponin constituents. Itselectively reduced the expression of LOXL2 mRNA and promoted the expression ofE-cadherin mRNA, and prevented the EMT process of MDA-MB-231 cells andTNF-α/TGF-β-stimulated MCF-7 cells. Moreover, it reduced the LOXL2 level inMDA-MB-231 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. When MCF-7 cells were stimulated withTNF-α/TGF-β, transfected with LOXL2 or treated with hypoxia, escin Iadown-regulated the level of LOXL2 in MCF-7 cells. Meanwhile, escin Ia suppressedthe EMT process in LOXL2-transfected or hypoxia-treated MCF-7 cells. Of interest,escin Ia did not alter the level of HIF-1α in hypoxia-induced MCF-7 cells. InTNBC xenograft mice, the metastasis and EMT of MDA-MB-231 cells were suppressedby escin Ia. In conclusion, escin Ia was the main active ingredient of SFAC forthe anti-TNBC metastasis activity, and its action mechanisms involved inhibitionof EMT process by down-regulating LOXL2 expression.","Wang, Yuhui, Xu, Xiaotian, Zhao, Peng, Tong, Bei, Wei, Zhifeng, Dai, Yue",2016,Oncotarget,2

However, the effect of celastrol onretinoblastoma has not yet been analyzed. Additionally, the poor water solubilityof celastrol restricts further therapeutic applications. The goal of this studywas to evaluate the effect of celastrol nanoparticles (CNPs) on retinoblastomaand to investigate the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS: Celastrol-loadedpoly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ɛ-caprolactone) nanopolymeric micelles weredeveloped to improve the hydrophilicity of celastrol. The 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulf-ophenyl)-2H tetrazolium monosodiumsalt (WST-8) assay was used to determine the inhibitory effect of CNPs on SO-Rb50 cell proliferation in vitro. Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate theapoptotic effect of CNPs on nuclear morphology, and flow cytometry was used toquantify cellular apoptosis. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, NF-κB p65, andphospo-NF-κB p65 proteins was assessed by Western blotting. A humanretinoblastoma xenograft model was used to evaluate the inhibitory effects ofCNPs on retinoblastoma in NOD-SCID mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was usedto assess the apoptotic effects of CNPs on retinoblastoma. RESULTS: CNPs inhibitthe proliferation of SO-Rb 50 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with anIC(50) of 17.733 μg/mL (celastrol-loading content: 7.36%) after exposure to CNPsfor 48 hours. CNPs induce apoptosis in SO-Rb 50 cells in a dose-dependent manner.The expression of Bcl-2, NF-κB p65, and phospo-NF-κB p65 proteins decreased afterexposure to CNPs 54.4 μg/mL for 48 hours. Additionally, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratioincreased, whereas the expression of Bax itself was not significantly altered.CNPs inhibit the growth of retinoblastoma and induce apoptosis in retinoblastomacells in mice. CONCLUSION: CNPs inhibit the growth of retinoblastoma in mousexenograft model by inducing apoptosis in SO-Rb 50 cells, which may be related tothe increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the inhibition of NF-κB. CNPs may represent apotential alternative treatment for retinoblastoma.","Li, Zhanrong, Wu, Xianghua, Li, Jingguo, Yao, Lin, Sun, Limei, Shi, Yingying, Zhang, Wenxin, Lin, Jianxian, Liang, Dan, Li, Yongping",2012,International journal of nanomedicine,2

The most prominent anti-malarialdrug artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone, is produced in glandular trichomes ofArtemisia annua. However, only limited genomic information is currently availablein this non-model plant species. RESULTS: We present a global characterization ofA. annua glandular trichome transcriptome using 454 pyrosequencing. Sequencingruns using two normalized cDNA collections from glandular trichomes yielded406,044 expressed sequence tags (average length = 210 nucleotides), whichassembled into 42,678 contigs and 147,699 singletons. Performing a secondsequencing run only increased the number of genes identified by approximately30%, indicating that massively parallel pyrosequencing provides deep coverage ofthe A. annua trichome transcriptome. By BLAST search against the NCBInon-redundant protein database, putative functions were assigned to over 28,573unigenes, including previously undescribed enzymes likely involved insesquiterpene biosynthesis. Comparison with ESTs derived from trichomecollections of other plant species revealed expressed genes in common functionalcategories across different plant species. RT-PCR analysis confirmed theexpression of selected unigenes and novel transcripts in A. annua glandulartrichomes. CONCLUSION: The presence of contigs corresponding to enzymes forterpenoids and flavonoids biosynthesis suggests important metabolic activity inA. annua glandular trichomes.

We give proof on a biochemical level thatseveral of these selected genes from this species are involved in isoprenebiosynthesis. This opens the possibilities to investigate the physiologicalfunction of isoprene emission and to increase the endogenous flux to theterpenoid precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, forthe heterologous production of more complex terpenoids in B. subtilis.","Julsing, Mattijs K, Rijpkema, Michael, Woerdenbag, Herman J, Quax, Wim J, Kayser, Oliver",2007,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2

Despite the availability of essential oil and volatile organiccompounds (VOCs) from Phoebe zhennan wood, their variation and dependence on treeage have not been examined. After essential oil extraction and wood processing,the yields and compositions of essential oils and VOCs in wood from P. zhennantrees of different ages (10a, 30a, and 80a) were determined. The yield ofessential oil from 30a wood was significantly greater than that from 10a and 80awood. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-massspectrometry (GC-MS) revealed 672 and 41 volatile compounds, respectively, in theessential oil and wood, the majority of which exhibited large fluctuations inrelative content and composition depending on tree age. Sesquiterpenoids, fattyacids and conjugates may greatly contribute to the main components of essentialoil from wood. Almost all major sesquiterpenoid compounds, such as caryophylleneα-oxide, eudesmo, and cubebene, were identified in the essential oils from the30a and 80a wood, and their relative contents were much greater than those in the10a wood. The main components of the wood fragrance were sesquiterpenoids. Thetypes and relative contents of sesquiterpenoids from wood increased with treeage. These results suggest that choosing wood from trees of a suitable age willsignificantly improve the efficiency of wood utilization.","Yang, Hanbo, Zhang, Shuaiying, Gu, Yunjie, Peng, Jian, Huang, Xin, Guo, Hongying, Chen, Lianghua, Jiang, Yongze, Liu, Minhao, Luo, Xiandan, Xie, Jiaxin, Wan, Xueqin",2024,Frontiers in plant science,2

Medicinal plants, e.g., Lavandula dentata L., are rich inphenolic compounds and may provide neuroprotective and anti-inflammatorybenefits. However, limited research evaluates their effectiveness in modulatingneuroinflammation and histopathological changes in epilepsy models. Therefore,the current study hypothesized that treating Lavandula dentata L. extract oressential oils may reduce neuroinflammatory responses and mitigatehistopathological changes in the brain, providing a natural alternative oradjunct therapy for epilepsy management. Methods: Five groups of male Wistar ratswere used: control, pilocarpine-treated epileptic, valproic acid (VPA-treatedepileptic), L. dentata extract, and essential oils. Numerous electrolyte levels,monoamine levels, neurotransmitter levels, and the mRNA expression of specificgate channel subtypes were evaluated in homogenate brain tissue. Additionally,histological changes in various brain regions were investigated. Results: Theinvestigation revealed that the extract and essential oils obtained from L.dentata L. exhibited the ability to improve the modulation of electrolytes andions across voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Furthermore, it was revealedthat they could decrease neuronal excitability by facilitating repolarization.Moreover, L. dentata's oil and ethanol extract re-balances T-reg/Th-17 cytokines,restoring the pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg markers, e.g., FOXP3 andCTLA-4, to their normal level. Conclusions: The present work confirms that theextract and essential oils of L. dentata L. have different activities toameliorate the progression of histopathological alterations. Therefore, when usedin conjunction with other AEDs, the extract and essential oils of L. dentata canslow the progression of epileptogenesis.","Antar, Aziza, Abdel-Rehiem, Eman S, Al-Khalaf, Areej A, Abuelsaad, Abdelaziz S A, Abdel-Gabbar, Mohamed, Shehab, Gaber M G, Abdel-Aziz, Ayman M",2024,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2

However, azole-resistant strains have been isolated from canineskin and ear canals worldwide. Phytochemicals isolated from essential oils areeffective alternatives for inhibiting Malassezia pachydermatis. To evaluate theusefulness of phytochemicals against azole-resistant isolates, we performed invitro susceptibility testing using the phytochemicals carvacrol, citral, andthymol. Eight antifungal-resistant isolates were obtained from 7 cases ofdermatitis and 1 case of otitis externa during 2022 and 2023 from dogs in Tokyoand Kanagawa, Japan. Fungal susceptibility to carvacrol, citral, and thymol wereassessed using the modified broth microdilution method. The minimum inhibitoryconcentrations (MICs) of the phytochemicals in all isolates were as follows: 0.03to 0.125% for carvacrol; 0.03 to 0.125% for thymol; and 0.03% to 0.125% forcitral. Based on these results, carvacrol, citral, and thymol appear to beeffective against azole-resistant strains.

With the increasing market demand, naturalagarwood resources are rapidly depleting, making the development of effectiveartificial induction methods for agarwood highly significant. This study aims toexplore the feasibility of using callus tissue to assess the ability of fungi toinduce agarwood formation. We selected two fungi isolated from Aquilariasinensis, W-1 (Podospora setosa) and W-15 (Alternaria alstroemeriae), and usedthe known agarwood-inducing fungi YMY (Pestalotiopsis sp.) as a positive control,by treating A. sinensis callus with their fermented filtrates. The experimentalresults showed that W-1 and W-15 treatments significantly enhanced the activityof Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Peroxidase (POD) in the callus tissue andupregulated the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS),1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and sesquiterpene synthase(ASS-1). GC-MS analysis further confirmed that the contents of sesquiterpenes andaromatic compounds in A. sinensis treated with W-1 and W-15 were significantlyelevated, suggesting that these fungi possess the capacity to induce theformation of agarwood. This study demonstrates that using callus tissue to screenfungi capable of inducing agarwood is feasible and effective, providing newinsights for screening fungi resources that efficiently induce agarwood formationin the future.","Wang, Zhikai, Zhou, Guoying, Chen, Jungang, Miao, Xinyu, Xia, Yandong, Du, Zhuang, Liu, Junang",2024,PloS one,2
23471,TA039632,10.1002/iid3.70015,Efficacy and mechanism of action of ginsenoside Rg3 on radiation proctitis inrats.,"OBJECTIVE: Radiation proctitis (RP) refers to rectal injury caused by radiationtreatment of pelvic and retroperitoneal malignancies, which has a major impact onthe treatment prognosis and quality of life of patients with cancer. Thetetracyclic triterpene saponin monomer ginsenoside Rg3 (GRg3), the primarybioactive ingredient in ginseng extracts, has therapeutic effects against RP inrats. Here, we validated its efficacy and elucidated its mechanism of action.METHODS: A rat RP model was established in 48 Wistar rats. Rats were randomlydivided into control (untreated), irradiation, irradiation + dexamethasone, andirradiation + GRg3 (low-, medium-, and high-dose) groups. After 2 weeks'treatment, serum IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-α levels were tested by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assays. In rectal tissue, Ikbkb, Ikka, and Casp8 mRNA expressionwas detected by a reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.IKK-β, IκB-α, p-IκB-α, p50, and caspase-8 protein levels were determined bywestern blot analysis. RESULTS: GRg3 significantly improved the general conditionand histopathological damage in rats with RP. Moreover, GRg3 decreased the levelsof factors that promote inflammation (TNF-α) and increased the levels of factorsthat reduce inflammation (IL-4 and IL-10). GRg3 markedly reduced the activationof NF-κB and caspase-8 signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, GRg3 may reduce theinflammatory response by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway and improving thebalance of inflammation-related factors. GRg3 may also inhibit intestinal cellapoptosis by suppressing the TNF-α/caspase-8 signaling cascade, thereby reducingradiological rectal injury. Our results verify that GRg3 is a promisingtherapeutic agent for RP treatment and shed light on its mechanism.","Li, Xuxia, Lin, Lili, Duan, Xiaoyu, Dai, Jiuju, Hu, Tingting, Cai, Hongyi",2024,"Immunity, inflammation and disease",2

AstragalosideIV (AS-IV) is one of the main active ingredients extracted from Astragalus rootand is a common Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinaldiseases. This study aimed to determine whether AS-IV has therapeutic value forDSS or LPS-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in vivo and in vitroand its potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The intestinal tissues from UCpatients and colitis mice were collected, intestinal inflammation was observed bycolonoscopy, and mucosal barrier function was measured by immunofluorescencestaining. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activator YS-49 and inhibitor LY-29 wereadministered to colitic mice to uncover the effect of this pathway on gut mucosalbarrier modulation. Then, network pharmacology was used to screen AstragalosideIV (AS-IV), a core active component of the traditional Chinese medicineAstragalus membranaceus. The potential of AS-IV for intestinal barrier functionrepairment and UC treatment through blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway was furtherconfirmed by histopathological staining, FITC-dextran, transmission electronmicroscopy, ELISA, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and western blotting. Finally,16 S rRNA sequencing was performed to uncover whether AS-IV can ameliorate UC byregulating gut microbiota homeostasis. RESULTS: Mucosal barrier function wassignificantly damaged in UC patients and murine colitis, and the activatedPI3K/AKT signaling pathway was extensively involved. Both in vivo and vitroshowed that the AS-IV-treated group significantly relieved inflammation andimproved intestinal epithelial permeability by inhibiting the activation of thePI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In addition, microbiome data found that gutmicrobiota participates in AS-IV-mediated intestinal barrier recovery as well.CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that AS-IV exerts a protective effect on theintegrality of the mucosal barrier in UC based on the PI3K/AKT pathway, and AS-IVmay serve as a novel AKT inhibitor to provide a potential therapy for UC.","Zhang, Xinhui, Zhang, Fan, Li, Yan, Fan, Na, Zhao, Ke, Zhang, Anding, Kang, Jiefang, Lin, Yan, Xue, Xiaochang, Jiang, Xun",2024,Journal of translational medicine,2

In this study, we describethe effect of altitudinal differences on the growth and active ingredients inRheum tanguticum Maxim. ex Balf. (R. tanguticum), a traditional Chinese medicinalherb known for its laxative properties. RESULTS: The results showed that plantsgrown at lower altitudes had better growth performances than those in higheraltitude areas. The yield varied by 2.45-23.68 times with altitude, reaching amaximum of 102.01 t/ha. In addition, total anthraquinone and total sennosidecontents decreased with increasing altitude, whereas total tannins increased withincreasing altitude. The total anthraquinone content of the indicator compoundreached 5.15% at five experimental sites, which exceeded the ChinesePharmacopoeia standard by 70.87%. The content of the other two categories ofactive ingredients reached a maximum value of 0.94% (total sennosides) and 2.65%(total tannins). Redundancy analysis revealed that annual rainfall, annualaverage temperature, annual sunshine hours, and pH significantly affected growthand active ingredients. Moreover, key metabolites, such as flavonoids, aminoacids and their derivatives, phenolic acids, lipids, and terpenes, weredifferentially expressed between samples from low- and high-altitude cultivationareas. These metabolites were enriched in the flavonoid and flavonol biosyntheticpathway and the monoterpene biosynthetic pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These resultssuggest that high anthraquinone content was observed in the lowest-latitudecultivation area due to low rainfall and alkaline soil pH. Key metabolites weresignificantly upregulated in high-latitude cultivation areas. These resultsprovide a scientific basis for quality control and the systematic cultivation ofR. tanguticum.","Wang, Lingling, Zhao, Shuo, Li, Jianan, Zhou, Guoying",2024,BMC plant biology,2

Following drying and storage, some lineswithin the panel had an increase in carotenoids approaching 50% compared with theinitial content at the fresh fruit stage. Other lines displayed a 25% loss ofcarotenoids. The quantitative determination of carotenoid pigments withconcurrent cellular analysis indicated that in most cases, pepper fruit withthicker (up to 4-fold) lipid exocarp layers and smooth surfaces exhibit improvedcarotenoid retention properties. Total cutin monomer content increased inmedium/high carotenoid retention fruits and subepidermal cutin deposits wereresponsible for the difference in exocarp thickness. Cutin biosynthesis andcuticle precursor transport genes were differentially expressed betweenmedium/high and low carotenoid retention genotypes, and this supports thehypothesis that the fruit cuticle can contribute to carotenoid retention.Enzymatic degradation of the cuticle and cell wall suggests that in Capsicum thecarotenoids (capsanthin and its esters) are embedded in the lipidic exocarplayer. This was not the case in tomato. Collectively, the data suggest that thefruit cuticle could provide an exploitable resource for the enhancement of fruitquality.","Holden, Alexandra C, Cohen, Hagai, Berry, Harriet M, Rickett, Daniel V, Aharoni, Asaph, Fraser, Paul D",2024,Journal of experimental botany,2

Serum biochemical parameters, 24-h urine protein excretion and renalhistopathology were evaluated in PHN and control rats. The expression of tumornecrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), the phosphorylation ofnuclear factor kappa B (p-NF-κB), the expression of associated proinflammatorycytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) and the ubiquitination of TRAF6 were measuredin PHN rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes. We detected a marked increase in mRNAexpression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β and in the protein abundance of p-NF-κB andTRAF6 within the renal tissues of PHN rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes.Conversely, there was a reduction in the K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6.Additionally, AS-IV was effective in ameliorating serum creatinine, proteinuria,and renal histopathology in PHN rats. This effect was concomitant with thesuppression of NF-κB pathway activation and decreased expression of TNF-α, IL-6,IL-1β and TRAF6. AS-IV decreased TRAF6 levels by promoting K48-linked ubiquitinconjugation to TRAF6, which triggered ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In summary,AS-IV averted renal impairment in PHN rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes, likely bymodulating the inflammatory response through the TRAF6/NF-κB axis. TargetingTRAF6 holds therapeutic promise for managing MN.","Ma, Yuhua, Hu, Yuwen, Ruan, Yilin, Jiang, Xiaocheng, Zhao, Min, Wang, Yuxin, Ke, Yanrong, Shi, Manman, Lu, Guoyuan",2024,Renal failure,2

However, little isknown about the expression pattern of WRKY genes during the germination andmaturation processes of Toona sinensis buds. In the present study, the newassembly of the T. sinensis genome was used for the identification of 78 TsWRKYgenes, including gene structures, phylogenetic features, chromosomal locations,conserved protein domains, cis-regulatory elements, synteny, and expressionprofiles. Gene duplication analysis revealed that gene tandem and segmentalduplication events drove the expansion of the TsWRKYs family, with the latterplaying a key role in the creation of new TsWRKY genes. The synteny andevolutionary constraint analyses of the WRKY proteins among T. sinensis andseveral distinct species provided more detailed evidence of gene evolution forTsWRKYs. Besides, the expression patterns and co-expression network analysis showTsWRKYs may multi-genes co-participate in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis.

Additionally, we used transcriptome analysis andRT-qPCR to explore the molecular pathways associated with nitrogen stress. Ourresults demonstrate a dramatic increase in the accumulation of phenolic acids andflavonoids in the low nitrogen (LN) stress group compared to the control (CK),with increases of 40.00% and 79.49%, respectively. Interestingly, plants in thehigh nitrogen (HN) stress group exhibited enhanced plant growth with largerleaves, thicker stems, and a 3% increase in volatile oil content compared to theCK. Moreover, A. argyi in the HN group displayed a 66% increase in volatile oilconcentration compared to the LN group. Our combined transcriptome and q-PCRresults indicate that LN stress promotes the expression of genes involved inflavonoid synthesis, while HN stress promotes the expression of genes related toterpene skeleton production and photosynthesis.

Therefore, medium optimization, upscaling, and filtrationwere performed to produce a beverage based on black currant pomace fermented withW. cocos. A trained panel described the beverage as highly pleasant, reminiscentof honey, flowers and berries with a well-balanced sour and sweet taste. Theflavor compounds linalool (citrus), geraniol (flowery), phenylacetic acid(honey), methyl phenylacetate (honey), eugenol (clove), and 2-phenylethanol(rose) were produced during fermentation and the concentrations exceeded theirrespective odor thresholds. The produced beverage was evaluated with 8.0 ± 1.4from 10 for the question of whether panelists would buy the product. Fungalfermentation with the edible fungus W. cocos enabled the production of a highlypleasant beverage and additionally may reduce waste by using pomace and tablesugar as sole ingredients.

Cultivated in Bulgaria and Their Antimicrobial and AntioxidantActivity.,"The genus Nepeta, belonging to the family Lamiaceae, includes about 300 species,most of which are used in folk medicine due to their pronounced biologicalproperties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the agrobiologicalcharacteristics of Nepeta transcaucasica (N. transcaucasica) Grossh. and Nepetacataria (N. cataria) L., cultivated in Bulgaria, and obtain their essential oilsand determine their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. The agrobiologicalcharacteristics of the two species growing in Kazanlak were analyzed; therefore,high variability in the population of N. transcaucasica and comparativehomogeneity in N. cataria was shown. The species N. transcaucasica contained0.28% essential oil with main components β-citronellol (52.05%), eucalyptol(7.34%), β-citronellal (6.06%), germacrene D (5.45%), (Z)-β-ocimene (5.14%), andβ-caryophyllene (3.06%). The species N. cataria consisted of 0.19% essential oilwith main components β-citronellol (26.31%), geraniol (15.92%), neral (11.45%),nerol (9.56%), carvacrol (6.04%), and β-citronellal (5.35%). The antibacterialactivity against Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcusaureus and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonellaenterica subsp. enterica serovar Abony was determined. The essential oils showedantimicrobial activity only against E. coli. The diameters of the inhibitionzones were found to be 26 mm for the species N. transcaucasica and 10 mm for thespecies N. cataria. The antioxidant activity of the two essential oils was alsodetermined by four different methods, DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC, with thehighest values for the ABTS radical, for the species N. transcaucasica (48.72 μMTE/mL), and the species N. cataria (310 μM TE/mL).","Mollova, Silviya, Dzhurmanski, Anatoli, Fidan, Hafize, Bojilov, Dimitar, Manolov, Stanimir, Dincheva, Ivayla, Stankov, Stanko, Stoyanova, Albena, Ercisli, Sezai, Assouguem, Amine, Marc, Romina Alina, Ullah, Riaz, Bari, Ahmed",2023,ACS omega,2

Furthermore, theincreased use of chemical fertilizers has given rise to numerous environmentalproblems and health risks. Presently, there is a transition towardsbiofertilizers to enhance crops' yield, encompassing medicinal and aromaticvarieties. METHODS: This study aimed to explore the impacts of plantgrowth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), both independently and in conjunction witharbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), on various morphological, physiological, andphytochemical characteristics of Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss. Thisexperimentation took place under different irrigation conditions. The irrigationschemes encompassed well watering (WW), mild water stress (MWS), and severe waterstress (SWS). The study evaluated the effects of various biofertilizers,including AMF, PGPR, and the combined application of both AMF and PGPR (AMF +PGPR), compared to a control group where no biofertilizers were applied. RESULTS:The findings of the study revealed that under water-stress conditions, the dryyield and relative water content of D. kotschyi Boiss. experienced a decline.However, the application of AMF, PGPR, and AMF + PGPR led to an enhancement indry yield and relative water content compared to the control group. Among thetreatments, the co-application of AMF and PGPR in plants subjected to wellwatering (WW) exhibited the tallest growth (65 cm), the highest leaf count (187),and the most elevated chlorophyll a (0.59 mg g(-1) fw) and b (0.24 mg g(-1) fw)content. Regarding essential oil production, the maximum content (1.29%) andyield (0.13 g plant (-1)) were obtained from mild water stress (MWS) treatment.The co-application of AMF and PGPR resulted in the highest essential oil contentand yield (1.31% and 0.15 g plant(-1), respectively). The analysis of D. kotschyiBoiss. essential oil identified twenty-six compounds, with major constituentsincluding geranyl acetate (11.4-18.88%), alpha-pinene (9.33-15.08%), Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (8.43-12.8%), neral (6.80-9.32%), geranial(9.23-11.91%), and limonene (5.56-9.12%). Notably, the highest content of geranylacetate, geranial, limonene, and alpha-pinene was observed in plants subjected toMWS treatment following AMF + PGPR application. Furthermore, the co-applicationof AMF, PGPR, and severe water stress (SWS) notably increased the total solublesugar (TSS) and proline content. In conclusion, the results indicate that thecombined application of AMF and PGPR can effectively enhance the quantity andquality of essential oil in D. kotschyi Boiss., particularly when the plants areexposed to water deficit stress conditions.","Gasemi, Saeid, Mahdavikia, Hassan, Rezaei-Chiyaneh, Esmaeil, Banaei-Asl, Farzad, Dolatabadian, Aria, Sadeghpour, Amir",2023,PeerJ,2

The use of nanocarriers can improve the therapeutic effect ofnatural drugs by targeting hepatocytes and higher loads. METHODS: firstly,uniformly dispersed three-dimensional dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres(MSNs) were synthesized. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) was covalently modified on MSNsurfaces through amide bond and then loaded with COSM to form drug-loadednanoparticles (COSM@MSN-NH(2)-GA). The constructed drug-loaded nano-deliverysystem was determined by characterization analysis. Finally, the effect ofnano-drug particles on cell viability was evaluated and the cell uptake in vitrowas observed. RESULTS: GA was successfully modified to obtain the sphericalnano-carrier MSN-NH(2)-GA (≤200 nm). The neutral surface charge improves itsbiocompatibility. MSN-NH(2)-GA has high drug loading (28.36% ± 1.00) because ofits suitable specific surface area and pore volume. In vitro cell experimentsshowed that COSM@MSN-NH(2)-GA significantly enhanced the uptake of liver cells(LO2) and decreased the AST and ALT indexes. CONCLUSION: this study demonstratedfor the first time that formulation and delivery schemes using natural drug COSMand nanocarrier MSN have a protective effect on APAP-induced hepatocyte injury.This result provides a potential nano-delivery scheme for the targeted therapy ofacute drug-induced liver injury.","Guo, Xinghua, Zhang, Chengcheng, Bai, Yan, Che, Qishi, Cao, Hua, Guo, Jiao, Su, Zhengquan",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

However, only asmall part of ginsenosides have been characterized in the roots and rhizomes ofpanax ginseng (RRPG) up to date, mainly because of a lack of the fragmentationions of many more ginsenosides. In order to comprehensively identify ginsenosidesin RRPG, molecular features of ginsenosides orienting precursor ions selectionand targeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis strategy were proposed inour study, in which the precursor ions were selected according to the molecularfeatures of ginsenosides irrespective of their peak abundances, and targetedMS/MS analysis was then performed to obtain their fragmentation ions forsubstance characterization. Using this strategy, a total of 620 ginsenosides weresuccessfully characterized in RRPG, including 309 protopanaxadiol-typeginsenosides, 258 protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides and 53 oleanane-typeginsenosides. It is worth noting that, except for the known aglyconesmass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 459, 475 and 455, twelve other aglycones, includingm/z 509, 507, 493, 491, 489, 487, 477, 473, 461, 457, 443 and 441, were firstreported in our experiment and they were probably the derivatizations of theprotopanaxatriol and protopanaxadiol.

We aim to increase this activityby testing the effect of a small library of ferruginol analogues. After ascreening of their antiproliferative activity (SRB staining, 48 h) on SK-Mel-28cells the analogue 18-aminoferruginol (GI50 ≈ 10 µM) was further selected formechanistic studies including induction of apoptosis (DAPI staining, p < 0.001),changes in cell morphology associated with the treatment (cell shrinkage andmembrane blebbing), induction of caspase-3/7 activity (2.5 at 48 h, 6.5 at 72 h;p < 0.0001), changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (not significant)and in vitro effects on cell migration and cell invasion (Transwell assays, notsignificant). The results were compared to those of the parent molecule(ferruginol, GI50 ≈ 50 µM, depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane p < 0.01 at72 h; no caspases 3/7 activation) and paclitaxel (GI50 ≈ 10 nM; caspases 3/7activation p < 0.0001) as a reference drug. Computational studies of theantiproliferative activity of 18-aminoferruginol show a consistent improvement inthe activity over ferruginol across a vast majority of cancer cells in the NCI60panel. In conclusion, we demonstrate here that the derivatisation of ferruginolinto 18-aminoferruginol increases its antiproliferative activity five times inSK-MEL-28 cells and changes the apoptotic mechanism of its parent molecule,ferruginol.","Shao, Luying, González-Cardenete, Miguel A, Prieto-Garcia, Jose M",2023,International journal of molecular sciences,2
26006,TA042181,10.3390/molecules28041725,Betulinic Acid Inhibits the Stemness of Gastric Cancer Cells by Regulating theGRP78-TGF-β1 Signaling Pathway and Macrophage Polarization.,"Cancer stemness is the process by which cancer cells acquire chemoresistance andself-renewal in the tumor microenvironment. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)is a biomarker for gastric cancer and is involved in cancer stemness. By inducingcancer stemness in various types of cancer, the polarization of macrophages intotumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) controls tumor progression. Betulinic acid(BA) is a bioactive natural compound with anticancer properties. However, whetherGRP78 regulates TAM-mediated cancer stemness in the tumor microenvironment andwhether BA inhibits GRP78-mediated cancer stemness in gastric cancer remainunknown. In this study, we investigated the role of GRP78 in gastric cancerstemness in a tumor microenvironment regulated by BA. The results indicated thatBA inhibited not only GRP78-mediated stemness-related protein expression andGRP78-TGF-β-mediated macrophage polarization into TAMs, but also TAM-mediatedcancer stemness. Therefore, BA is a promising candidate for clinical applicationin combination-chemotherapy targeting cancer stemness.","Chen, Jen-Lung, Tai, Yun-Shen, Tsai, Hsin-Yi, Hsieh, Chia-Yuan, Chen, Chun-Lin, Liu, Chung-Jung, Wu, Deng-Chyang, Huang, Yaw-Bin, Lin, Ming-Wei",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

26258,TA042435,10.3390/molecules27217215,Microplastic-Free Microcapsules to Encapsulate Health-Promoting Limonene Oil.,"Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry has long included many appealingessential oils in products to meet consumers' needs. Among all, the demand forlimonene (LM) has recently surged due to its broad-spectrum health benefits, withapplications in cosmetic, detergent, and food products. However, LM is extremelyvolatile, hence has often been encapsulated for a longer shelf-life. To date,mostly non-biodegradable synthetic polymers have been exploited to fabricate themicrocapsule shells, and the resulting microcapsules contribute to theaccumulation of microplastic in the environment. So far, information onLM-entrapping microcapsules with a natural microplastic-free shell and theirmechanism of formation is limited, and there is lack of an in-depthcharacterisation of their mechanical and adhesive properties, which are crucialfor understanding their potential performance at end-use applications. Thepresent research aims towards developing safe microcapsules with a core of LMfabricated via complex coacervation (CC) using gum Arabic (GA) and fungallysourced chitosan (fCh) as shell precursors. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) forLM was quantified by gas chromatography (GC) separation method. The morphology ofmicrocapsules was investigated via bright-field optical microscopy and scanningelectron microscopy, and their mechanical properties were characterised using amicromanipulation technique. Moreover, the adhesive properties of the resultingmicrocapsules were studied via a bespoke microfluidic device fitted with apolyethylene-terephthalate (PET) substrate and operating at increasinglyhydrodynamic shear stress (HSS). Spherical core-shell microcapsules (EE ~45%)with a mean size of 38 ± 2 μm and a relatively smooth surface were obtained.Their mean rupture force and nominal rupture stress were 0.9 ± 0.1 mN and 2.1 ±0.2 MPa, respectively, which are comparable to those of other microcapsules withsynthetic shells, e.g., urea- and melamine-formaldehyde. It was also found thatthe fCh-GA complexed shell provided promising adhesive properties onto PET films,leading to a microcapsule retention of ~85% and ~60% at low (≤50 mPa) and highshear stress (0.9 Pa), respectively. Interestingly, these values are similar tothe adhesion data available in literature for microplastic-based microcapsules,such as melamine-formaldehyde (50-90%). Overall, these findings suggest thatmicroplastics-free microcapsules with a core of oil have been successfullyfabricated, and can offer a potential for more sustainable, consumer- andenvironmentally friendly applications in FMCGs.","Baiocco, Daniele, Zhang, Zhibing",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

However, the limited number of studies hampers ourunderstanding of the relationships between the Ae. albopictus olfactory systemand the complex chemical world. METHODS: We performed RT-qPCR assay on antennaeof Ae. albopictus mosquitoes of different sexes, ages and physiological states,and found odorant receptor 11 (AalbOr11) enriched in non-blood-fed femalemosquitoes. Then, we examined the odorant preference with a panel ofphysiologically and behaviorally relevant odorants in Xenopus oocytes. RESULTS:The results indicated that AalbOr11 could be activated by ten aromatics, seventerpenes, six heterocyclics, and three alcohols. Furthermore, using post-RNAinterference (RNAi) hand-in-cage assay, we found that reducing the transcriptlevel of AalbOr11 affected the repellency activity mediated by (+)-fenchone at alower concentration (0.01% v/v). CONCLUSIONS: Using in vitro functionalcharacterization, we found that AalbOr11 was a broadly tuned receptor. Moreover,we found that AalbOr11 shared a conserved odorant reception profile withhomologous Anopheles gambiae Or11. In addition, RNAi and bioassay suggested thatAablOr11 might be one of the receptors mediating (+)-fenchone repellencyactivity. Our study attempted to link odor-induced behaviors to odorant receptionand may lay the foundation for identifying active semiochemicals for monitoringor controlling mosquito populations.","Yan, Ru, Xu, Zhanyi, Qian, Jiali, Zhou, Qiaoling, Wu, Huiming, Liu, Yahui, Guo, Yirong, Zhu, Guonian, Chen, Mengli",2022,Parasites & vectors,2

In the present study, theantiprotozoal activity of a mixture of essential oils (eucalyptus, lavender,cedar and tea tree), organic acids (acetic acid, propionic acid and lactic acid)and metal ions (Cu, Zn, Mn) were tested. As a model, protozoans were selected:Euglena gracilis, Gregarina blattarum, Amoeba proteus, Paramecium caudatum,Pentatrichomonas hominis. The tested concentrations of mixtures were in the rangeof 0.001-1.5%.

Some species can sequester CTDfrom the CTD-producing species, using it as a chemical defense against enemies.The present paper focuses on the first-ever description of canthariphilousinteractions between a checkered beetle species (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and a CTD-producing species. Field observations revealed individuals of the phytophagousbeetle Tilloidea transversalis (Charpentier, 1825) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) bitingindividuals of the blister beetle Lydus trimaculatus (Fabricius, 1775)(Coleoptera: Meloidae). Laboratory behavioral experiments followed to verify ifthis peculiar behavior of T. transversalis also occurs on other co-occurringspecies. Moreover, chemical analyses were performed to assess whether T.transversalis can sequester CTD. Our results show that T. transversalis onlyattacks CTD-producing species. However, while chemical analyses prove that T.transversalis can sequester CTD from the hemolymph of L. trimaculatus, some clues(based on a CTD-baited traps sampling) suggest that this beetle, contrarily toother canthariphilous species, does not appear to show a high attraction to puresynthetic CTD. Thus, other unknown signals, alone or in combination with CTD,could be implicated in triggering the canthariphilous behaviors of T.transversalis.","Molfini, Marco, Stefanuto, Luca, Gisondi, Silvia, Gasperi, Tecla, Di Giulio, Andrea, Mancini, Emiliano, Bologna, Marco A",2022,Journal of insect science (Online),2

Studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in HSCactivation. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of 84 miRNAs using miRNA arraysin primary mouse quiescent HSC (qHSC) and activated HSC (aHSC) treatedwith/without ASTX during their activation. Compared with qHSC, the expression of14 miRNAs and 23 miRNAs was increased and decreased by more than 2-fold,respectively, in aHSC. Among the 14 miRNAs increased in aHSC, the expression ofmiR-192-5p, miR-382-5p, and miR-874-3p was reduced by ASTX. In addition, ASTXincreased the expression of miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p, and miR-101a-3p among 23miRNAs decreased in aHSC. Moreover, we confirmed miR-382-5p expression was~15-fold higher in aHSC than qHSC, and ASTX markedly inhibited the inductionmeasured by quantitative real-time PCR. We identified that the expression ofBaz1a and Zfp462 from the predicted miR-382-5p target genes was significantlyreduced in aHSC while increased by ASTX treatment similar to the levels in qHSC.The roles of Baz1a and Zfp462 in HSC activation and the antifibrogenic effect ofASTX need to be further investigated.","Bae, Minkyung, Kim, Mi-Bo, Lee, Ji-Young",2022,Nutrients,2

Stem Barks.,"Schistosomiasis control remains a public health concern, and there is a need toevaluate new strategies for targeting larval and adult stages of the parasite. AsPedilanthus tithymaloides is empirically used to treat schistosomiasis, itbecomes essential to know its effective action scientifically. This studyassessed the cercaricidal and schistosomicidal activity of P. tithymaloides stembarks raffia wine extract (RwPt) and hydroethanolic extract (HePt). Differentconcentrations of these extracts were tested against cercariae (31.25-1000 μg/mL)and adult worms (62.5-2000 μg/mL) of Schistosoma mansoni. Niclosamide-olamine 5%(1 μg/mL) and praziquantel (10 μg/mL) were used as pharmacological controls.Cercariae viability was determined every 30 min for 180 min, and adult worms'motor activity and viability after 24 and 48 h incubation. In addition,cytotoxicity and phytochemical analysis were performed. HePt was lethal tocercariae and adult worms with LC(50) of 73.91 μg/mL after 60 min of incubationand 731.17 μg/mL after 48 h of incubation, respectively. Furthermore, asignificant reduction of 94.44% in motor activity was observed in surviving wormsat the concentration of 2000 μg/mL. RwPt was less effective on S. mansonicercariae with an LC(50) of 617.86 μg/mL after 180 min and on adult worms with amortality rate of 9.83% at 2000 μg/mL for 48 h incubation. Both extracts showed aweak cytotoxicity profile with an IC(50) of 983.50 μg/mL for HePt and more than1000 μg/mL for RwPt. The LC-MS analysis of HePt allowed the detection of twoannotated diterpenoids. Based on the selectivity index, the hydroethanolicextract of P. tithymaloides stem barks disclosed an intense cercaricidal activityand a moderate schistosomicidal effect with low cytotoxicity. These findings maysupport the potential use of Pedilanthus tithymaloides as a natural product or asource of natural-derived compounds for interrupting schistosomiasistransmission.","Tienga Nkondo, Emilienne, Boukeng Jatsa, Hermine, Gipwe Feussom, Nestor, Kenfack, Mérimé Christian, Membe Femoe, Ulrich, Tamdem Guetchueng, Stephanie, Kopa Kowa, Theodora, Kamtchouing, Pierre, Tchuem Tchuente, Louis-Albert",2022,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2

In this study, components ofessential oils from A. dalai-lamae, A. tangutica, A. sieversiana, A.tanacetifolia and A. ordosica were identified by GC-MS. A total of 56constituents were analysed, and each species consisted of 9 to 24 constituents.Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed that A. dalai-lamae, A. tangutica andA. tanacetifolia are characterised by monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenatedmonoterpenes. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed the most remarkablesimilarity between A. sieversiana and A. ordosica, but the similarity was stilllower than 50%. Contact toxicity and repellency of essential oils were evaluatedby bioassays; A. ordosica oil exhibited the most substantial contact toxicity(LD50 = 52.11 μg/cm2) against Liposcelis bostrychophila, while A. tangutica oilshowed the most potent contact toxicity (LD50 = 17.42 μg/adult) against Triboliumcastaneum. Except for A. dalai-lamae, the other four species showed the samelevel (p > 0.05) of repellent activity as the positive control against both pestsat high concentrations.

Therefore, the purpose ofthis study is to establish a continuous bioreactor with immobilized enzymes toproduce siamenoside I and mogroside IV. The results show that the immobilizationprocess of β-glucosidase exhibited the best relative activity with aglutaraldehyde (GA) concentration of 1.5%, carrier activation time of 1 h andbinding enzyme time of 12 h. After the immobilization through GA linkage, thehighest relative activity of β-glucosidase was recorded through the reaction withthe substrate at 60 °C and pH 5. Subsequently, the glass microspheres withimmobilized β-glucosidase were filled into the reactor to maintain the optimalactive environment, and the aqueous solution of Siraitia grosvenorii extract wasintroduced by controlling the flow rate. The highest concentration of siamenosideI and mogroside IV were obtained at a flow rate of 0.3 and 0.2 mL/min,respectively. By developing this immobilized enzyme system, siamenoside I andmogroside IV can be prepared in large quantities for industrial applications.","Chen, Hung-Yueh, Lin, Ching-Hsiang, Hou, Chih-Yao, Lin, Hui-Wen, Hsieh, Chang-Wei, Cheng, Kuan-Chen",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

However, the upstream mechanism regulating the herbivore-induced expressionof volatile biosynthesis genes is unclear, especially at the level of epigeneticregulation. In this study, similar to the effects of a tea green leafhopperinfestation, treatments with exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and histone deacetylaseinhibitors significantly increased the (E)-nerolidol content in tea and inducedthe expression of the associated biosynthesis gene CsNES. Furthermore, a keytranscription factor related to JA signaling, myelocytomatosis 2 (CsMYC2),interacted with histone deacetylase 2 (CsHDA2) in vitro and in vivo. A tea greenleafhopper infestation inhibited CsHDA2 expression and decreased CsHDA2abundance. Moreover, the tea green leafhopper infestation increased H3 and H4acetylation levels in the promoter region of CsNES, which in turn upregulated theexpression of CsNES and increased the (E)-nerolidol content. In this study, werevealed the effects of histone acetylations on the accumulation of HIPVs, whilealso confirming that CsHDA2-CsMYC2 is an important transcriptional regulatorymodule for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by tea green leafhoppers.The results of this study may be useful for characterizing plant aromaticcompounds and the main upstream stress-responsive signaling molecules.Furthermore, the study findings will assist researchers clarify the epigeneticregulation influencing plant secondary metabolism in response to external stress.","Gu, Dachuan, Wu, Shuhua, Yu, Zhenming, Zeng, Lanting, Qian, Jiajia, Zhou, Xiaochen, Yang, Ziyin",2022,Horticulture research,2

Evidence suggests that asiaticosideplays vital roles on anti-inflammatory and, anti-kidney fibrosis effects, andpromotes tissue repair. However, the effects of asiaticoside on AKI caused byischemia-reperfusion have not been well defined. Herein, we explored theprotective effect of asiaticoside on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)using in vivo and in vitro studies, and elucidated the potential mechanism ofasiaticoside-mediated repair. Results showed that asiaticoside attenuated thelevels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) in the IRI model.Meanwhile, asiaticoside reduced the secretion of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α, butincreased IL-10 secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Treating Raw264.7 cellswith lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced an inflammatory response, but theLPS-induced effects were attenuated after administering asiaticoside.Furthermore, asiaticoside significantly inhibited the expression of inducibleNitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) and promoted the expression of Arginase1 induced byLPS, which are the polarization marker proteins. In conclusion, this study showsthat asiaticoside possesses protective action in AKI after ischemia-reperfusion,due to the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and promoting transformation ofmacrophages from M1 type to M2 type.","Tang, Shengjie, Xie, Xiangcheng, Wang, Ming, Yang, Lili, Wei, Wei",2022,Bioengineered,2

Adult male mice were administeredCon A (15 mg/kg, intravenously) for 8 h. In the treated groups, mice werepretreated with escin daily (10 mg/kg in CMC, orally) for 4 days before Con Aintoxication. In addition, escin was administered in a group to examine itseffect on normal mice. Our results showed that escin inhibited Con A-inducedelevation in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and LDH) and curbed the Con A-inducedhepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis together with abrogating the death pathway,JNK. Coincidentally, escin has shown a reduction in neutrophil, CD4+ T cell, andmonocyte infiltration into the liver. In addition, escin modulated the cellularoxidant status by compensating for the Con A-depleted expression of thetranscription factor Nrf2 and the stress protein hemeoxygenase-1. These effectswere in good agreement with the restraining effect of escin on Con A-instigatedoverexpression of NF-κB and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A.Interestingly, Con A provoked the cellular protective pathway IL-22/STAT3, whichwas revoked by the escin pretreatment. In conclusion, escin shows extendedantioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinecrotic, and anti-apoptotic effects againstCon A-induced immune-mediated hepatitis. These effects may collectively be viasuppressing immune cell infiltration into the liver and selective modulation ofNrf2/HO-1, TNF-α/NF-κB, TNF-α/JNK, and IL-22/STAT3 signaling pathways.","Elshal, Mahmoud, Hazem, Sara H",2022,Inflammopharmacology,2

We aimed to study in anIVH model in immature rats the neuroprotective effect of betulinic acidhydroxamate (BAH), a B55α/PP2A activator that inhibits the activity of thehypoxia-inducing factor prolyl-hydroxylase type 2. IVH was induced in 1-day-old(P1) Wistar rats by the left periventricular injection of Clostridialcollagenase. Then, pups received i.p. vehicle or BAH 3 mg/kg single dose. At P6,P14 and P45, brain damage (area of damage, neurobehavioral deficits,Lactate/N-acetylaspartate ratio), white matter injury (WMI: corpus callosumatrophy and myelin basic protein signal reduction) and inflammation (TLR4, NF-κBand TNFα expression), excitotoxicity (Glutamate/N-acetylspartate) and oxidativestress (protein nitrosylation) were evaluated. BAH treatment did not reduce thevolume of brain damage, but it did reduce perilesional tissue damage, preventingan IVH-induced increase in Lac/NAA. BAH restored neurobehavioral performance atP45 preventing WMI. BAH prevented an IVH-induced increase in inflammation,excitotoxicity and oxidative stress.

Here, we found thatthe essential oil (EO) extracted from E. densa possesses obvious effects againstthe insects that threaten stored-products. In this work, we investigated thechemical constituents of the essential oil extracted from Elsholtzia densa, andtheir insecticidal (contact and fumigant) toxicity against Tribolium castaneumand Lasioderma serricorne. A total of 45 compounds were identified by GC-MS,accounting for 98.74% of the total EO. Meanwhile, 11 compounds were isolated fromthe EO, including limonene, β-caryophyllene, ρ-cymene, trans-phytol, α-terpineol,linalool, acetophenone, 1,8-cineole, ρ-cymen-7-ol, 1-O-cerotoylgly-cerol, andpalmitic acid. Furthermore, acetophenone, ρ-cymen-7-ol, and 1-O-cerotoylgly-cerolwere isolated for the first time from Elsholtzia spp. The results of thebioassays indicated that the EO had the property of insecticidal toxicity againstT. castaneum and L. serricorne. All of the compounds showed different levels ofinsecticidal toxicity against the two species of insects. Among them,2-ethyl-1H-imidazole had no insecticidal toxicity against T. castaneum, butpossessed fumigant and obvious contact toxicity against L. serricorne.ρ-Cymen-7-ol had beneficial insecticidal toxicity against the two species ofinsects, and fumigant toxicity against L. serricorne. ρ-Cymen-7-ol (LD(50) =13.30 μg/adult), 1-octen-3-ol (LD(50) = 13.52 μg/adult), and 3-octanol (LD(50) =17.45 μg/adult) showed significant contact toxicity against T. castaneum.Acetophenone (LD(50) = 7.07 μg/adult) and ρ-cymen-7-ol (LD(50) = 8.42 μg/adult)showed strong contact toxicity against L. serricorne. ρ-Cymene (LC(50) = 10.91mg/L air) and ρ-cymen-7-ol (LC(50) = 10.47 mg/L air) showed powerful fumiganttoxicity to T. castaneum. Limonene (LC(50) = 5.56 mg/L air), acetophenone (LC(50)= 5.47 mg/L air), and 3-octanol (LC(50) = 5.05 mg/L air) showed obvious fumiganttoxicity against L. serricorne. In addition, the EO and its chemical compoundspossessed different levels of repellent activity. This work provides someevidence of the value of exploring these materials for insecticidal activity, forhuman health purposes.

Antimalarial classical medicationsinclude quinine-based drugs, like chloroquine, and artesunate, a derivative ofartemisinin, a molecule found in the plant Artemisia annua. Such therapeutics arevery effective but show heavy side effects like drug resistance. In this study,""green"" silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been prepared from two Artemisiaspecies (A. abrotanum and A. arborescens), traditionally used in folk medicine asa remedy for different conditions, and their potential antimalarial efficacy havebeen assessed. AgNPs have been characterized by UV-Vis, dynamic light scatteringand zeta potential, FTIR, XRD, TEM and EDX. The structural characterization hasdemonstrated the spheroidal shape of nanoparticles and dimensions under 50 nm,useful for biomedical studies. Zeta potential analysis have shown the stabilityand dispersion of green AgNPs in aqueous medium without aggregation. AgNPshemocompatibility and antimalarial activity have been studied in Plasmodiumfalciparum cultures in in vitro experiments. The antiplasmodial effect has beenassessed using increasing doses of AgNPs (0.6 to 7.5 μg/mL) on parasitized redblood cells (pRBCs). Obtained data showed that the hemocompatibility of AgNPs isrelated to their synthetic route and depends on the administered dose. A.abrotanum-AgNPs (1) have shown the lowest percentage of hemolytic activity onpRBCs, underlining their hemocompatibility. These results are in accordance withthe lower levels of parasitemia observed after A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) treatmentrespect to A. arborescens-AgNPs (2), and AgNPs (3) derived from a classicalchemical synthesis. Moreover, after 24 and 48 hours of A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1)treatment, the parasite growth was locked in the ring stage, evidencing theeffect of these nanoparticles to hinder the maturation of P. falciparum. Theanti-malarial activity of A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) on pRBCs was demonstrated to behigher than that of A. arborescens-AgNPs (2).","Avitabile, Elisabetta, Senes, Nina, D'Avino, Cristina, Tsamesidis, Ioannis, Pinna, Alessandra, Medici, Serenella, Pantaleo, Antonella",2020,PloS one,2

The aim of this study was to determine themolecular mechanism of CA in HCC treatment. MTT assay was used to determine theIC(50) of CA. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were used to detect theinteraction and subcellular localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP) andmouse double minute 2 (MDM2). In addition, in vivo xenotransplantation wasperformed to assess the effects of CA, YAP, and MDM2 on tumorigenesis. The IC(50)of CA was about 40 M in different HCC cell lines, and CA decreased YAP expressionby reducing its stability and increasing its ubiquitination. CA treatment andMDM2 overexpression significantly decreased the crosstalk between YAP andcAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), TEA domain transcription factor(TEAD), and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). CA stimulation promotedthe translocation of YAP and MDM2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and increasedtheir binding. In addition, CA treatment obviously reduced tumorigenesis, whereasthis effect was abolished when cells were transfected with sh-MDM2 or Vector-YAP.The present study uncovered that CA induced cancer progress repression throughtranslocating YAP from the nucleus in HCC, which might provide a new therapeutictarget for HCC.","Jia, Ming, Xiong, Yulin, Li, Maoshi, Mao, Qing",2020,Oncology research,2

To explore themechanisms of carvacrol against herpes simplex virus (HSV) in vitro. METHOD: TheBSC-1 cells model of HSV infection was established, and from the two aspects ofviral replication level and cell death pathway, the antiviral effects ofcarvacrol on HSV infected cells were also evaluated by plaque assay under thethree modes including prevention, treatment, and direct inactivation. RESULTS: Inthe three ways, the half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of 2% truecarvacrol solution on HSV-2 infected cells were severally 0.43, 0.19 and0.51 mmol/L, and the corresponding therapeutic index (TI) were 4.02, 9.11 and3.39, respectively. It's the opposite of the increased levels caused by HSV-2infection, that both the expressions at the transcription genes and proteinlevels of virus own replication key factors (including ICP4, ICP27, VP16, gB, andUL30) and cytokines (including RIP3, TNF-α, and MLKL) of infected cells treatedwith carvacrol were dose-dependently inhibited. Besides, HSV-2 infection cancause the decrease of intracellular protein ubiquitination level, and carvacrolcan reverse the ubiquitination decrease level caused by HSV-2 infection.CONCLUSION: Carvacrol exhibits significant antiviral activity by inhibiting theHSV-2 proliferation process and HSV-2-induced TNF-α increasing levels, decreasingRIP3 and MLKL protein expressions through the intracellular RIP3-mediatedprogrammed cell necrosis pathway. In addition, carvacrol also may exhibitanti-HSV-2 activity by reversing the ubiquitination decrease level caused byHSV-2 infection on the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which provides insights intothe molecular mechanism.","Wang, Li, Wang, Dan, Wu, Xingan, Xu, Rui, Li, Yunlan",2020,BMC infectious diseases,2

Induces Triple NegativeBreast Cancer Cells Apoptosis through Oxidative Stress Pathway.,"Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are associated with poor patient survivalbecause of the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), andhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressions. Our previous studieshave shown that the triterpenoid saponin AG8 from Ardisia gigantifolia stapf.inhibits the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. In this study, the effects of AG8were further analyzed in different TNBC cell types: MDA-MB-231, BT-549, andMDA-MB-157 cells. AG8 inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231, BT-549, andMDA-MB-157 cells in a dose-dependent manner and showed stronger cytotoxicity toAfrican American (AA) and mesenchymal (M) subtypes than Caucasian (CA) andmesenchymal stem-like (MSL) subtypes, respectively. AG8 impaired the uptake ofMitoTracker Red CMXRos by the mitochondria of TNBC cells in a dose-dependentmanner, and this was recovered by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). AG8 affected GSH,SOD, and MDA levels of TNBC cells, but different TNBC subtypes had differentsensitivities to AG8 and NAC. In addition, we found that AG8 increased theBax/Bcl-2 ratio and the levels of cytoplasmic cytochrome c and significantlydecreased phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells. AG8elicited its anticancer effects through ROS generation, ERK and AKT activation,and by triggering mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in TNBC cells. AG8 hadselective cytotoxic effects against the AA and M TNBC subtypes and markedlyinduced MDA-MB-157 (AA subtype) cell apoptosis through pathways that were notassociated with ROS, which was different from the other two subtypes. Theunderlying mechanisms should be further investigated.","Mu, Li-Hua, Wang, Li-Hua, Yu, Teng-Fei, Wang, Yu-Ning, Yan, Hong, Liu, Ping, Yan, Can",2020,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2

In this task, the rats weredivided into eight groups: (1) Control, (2) sham operate, (3) negative control(vehicle) + Aβ(1-42), (4) ASX extract+Aβ(1-42), (5) commercial ASX + Aβ(1-42),(6) ASX powder + Aβ(1-42), (7) blank powder + Aβ(1-42), and (8) vitamin E +Aβ(1-42). All treatments were orally administrated for 30 days. At 14- and29-days post injection, animals were observed in behavioral tests. On the 31stday, animals were sacrificed; the hippocampus and cortex were collected. Thosetwo brain areas were then homogenized and stored for biochemical and histologicalanalysis. The results showed that the Aβ(1-42) infused group significantlyreduced cognitive ability and increased memory loss, as assessed by the Morriswater maze test, novel object recognition test, and novel object location test.Moreover, the Aβ(1-42) infused group exhibited a deterioration of oxidativemarkers, including glutathione peroxidase enzymes (GPx), lipid peroxidation(MDA), products of protein oxidation, and superoxide anion in the cortex and thehippocampus. Meanwhile, ASX powder (10 mg/kg body weight) showed a significantreduction in cognitive and memory impairments and oxidative stress which isgreater than ASX extract in the same dose of compound or vitamin E (100 mg/kgbody weight). Our study indicates the beneficial properties of ASX in alleviationof cognitive functions and reducing neurodegeneration in Wistar rats induced byamyloid-β (1-42) peptides.","Taksima, Takunrat, Chonpathompikunlert, Pennapa, Sroyraya, Morakot, Hutamekalin, Pilaiwanwadee, Limpawattana, Maruj, Klaypradit, Wanwimol",2019,Marine drugs,2

Behavioral responses of H. depressus to airbornevolatile extracts from conspecifics suggested the presence of a male-producedaggregation pheromone. GC analyses of these extracts showed the presence of fourmale-specific compounds. Analytical data in combination with the synthesis ofstandards led to the identification of the male-released semiochemicals asepoxyisophorone (1), isophorone (2), homalinol (3), and 2-hydroxyisophorone (4),of which (3) was the major constituent. The configuration of homalinol wasdetermined to be cis on the basis of retention times of synthetic cis and transsynthetic standards. Enantiomers of cis-homalinol were obtained in highenantiomeric excess by using biocatalysis. Their separation on a GCenantioselective column (β-Dex325®), allowed us to unambiguously determine thatthe absolute configuration of natural homalinol was (1R,2R,6S).

Inefficientdrugs, their adverse effects, and the development of drug resistance make itdifficult to curb the growing incidence of pancreatic cancer. Against thisbackdrop, the development new drug regimens with no or negligible adverse effectsis imperative. We assessed the anticancer effects of a plant-derivedsesquiterpene - matricine - against capan-2 pancreatic cancer cells. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. AO/EB, DAPI, and annexin V/PIstaining were used to detect apoptosis. Transwell assays were used for monitoringof cell migration and invasion. Immunoblotting was used to examine the expressionof proteins. RESULTS The results showed that matricine halted the proliferationof capan-2 cells, with minimal toxic effects on normal pancreatic cells. Theanticancer effects were due to the induction of apoptotic cell death, which wasallied with activation of caspases 3 and 9, upregulation of Bax, anddownregulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, matricine suppressed the migration andinvasive abilities of pancreatic cancer cells at IC50. We also assessed theeffects of matricine on the mTOR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. We found thatmatricine efficiently blocked this pathway, suggesting the anticancer potentialof matricine. CONCLUSIONS Matricine induced antiproliferative effects in capan-2human pancreatic cancer cells through inducing apoptosis, caspase activation,inhibition of cell migration and invasion, and blocking the mTOR/PI3K/AKTsignalling pathway.","Fang, Kaifeng, Wang, Li, Chen, LuJia, Liu, Tao, Fang, Zhi",2019,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental andclinical research,2

In the major crop plants,next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are intensely applied to exploitgenetic resources, to develop genomic resources and to enhance breeding. Here,genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) has been used in the non-model medicinal plantchamomile to evaluate the genetic structure of the cultivatedvarieties/populations, and to perform genome wide association study (GWAS)focusing on genes with large effect on flowering time and the medicinallyimportant alpha-bisabolol content. RESULTS: GBS analysis allowed theidentification of 6495 high-quality SNP-markers in our panel of 91 M. recutitaplants from 33 origins (2-4 genotypes each) and 4 M. discoidea plants asoutgroup, grown in the greenhouse in Gatersleben, Germany. M. recutita proved tobe clearly distinct from the outgroup, as was demonstrated by different clusterand principal coordinate analyses using the SNP-markers. Chamomile genotypes fromthe same origin were mostly genetically similar. Model-based cluster analysisrevealed one large group of tetraploid genotypes with low genetic differentiationincluding 39 plants from 14 origins. Tetraploids tended to display lower geneticdiversity than diploids, probably reflecting their origin by artificialpolyploidisation from only a limited set of genetic backgrounds. Analyses offlowering time demonstrated that diploids generally flowered earlier thantetraploids, and the analysis of alpha-bisabolol identified several tetraploidgenotypes with a high content. GWAS identified highly significant (P < 0.01) SNPsfor flowering time (9) and alpha-bisabolol (71). One sequence harbouring SNPsassociated with flowering time was described to play a role in self-pollinationin Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas four sequences harbouring SNPs associated withalpha-bisabolol were identified to be involved in plant biotic and abiotic stressresponse in various plants species. CONCLUSIONS: The first genomic resource forfuture applications to enhance breeding in chamomile was created, andanalyses ofdiversity will facilitate the exploitation of these genetic resources. The GWASdata pave the way for future research towards the genetics underlying importanttraits in chamomile, the identification of marker-trait associations, anddevelopment of reliable markers for practical breeding.","Otto, Lars-Gernot, Mondal, Prodyut, Brassac, Jonathan, Preiss, Susanne, Degenhardt, Jörg, He, Sang, Reif, Jochen Christoph, Sharbel, Timothy Francis",2017,BMC genomics,2

Among the tested EOs, peppermint oil proved significantlyeffective (P ≤ 0.05) on S.oryzae at 400 μl/L air concentration, inducing 83 and100% mortalities in with-food and without-food conditions respectively over 72 hexposure. In addition, it was also observed that the binary mixtures ofpeppermint + lemon oil (1:1 ratio) produced an equivalent effect to that ofpeppermint oil alone treatments. The phytochemical residue analysis by GC-MSrevealed the presence of six compounds upon 72 h exposure to EOs. Further, theanalysis of physico-chemical properties of the compounds indicated a positivecorrelation between polar surface area (PSA) and its residual nature. The residuelevels of eugenol were significantly elevated corresponding to its high PSA value(29) in clove and cinnamon oils. On the other hand, the compounds with zero PSAvalue imparted very less or no (D-Limonene, caryophyllene, pinene andterpinolene) residues in treated grains. With respect to the most activepeppermint oil, L-menthone, menthyl acetate and eucalyptol residues were at 67,41 and 23% levels respectively. The outcome of the present study indicate thepeppermint oil as a potent fumigant against S. oryzae, and although the residuesof phytochemicals in treated grains is higher; they belong to the generallyrecognised as safe (GRAS) status leaving no harmful effect.","Vendan, S Ezhil, Manivannan, S, Sunny, Anila M, Murugesan, R",2017,PloS one,2

In this work, we isolated a gene (BfLCYB) encoding a lycopeneβ-cyclase from Bangia fuscopurpurea, a red alga that is considered to be one ofthe primitive multicellular eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms and accumulatescarotenoid constituents with both β- and ε-rings, including β-carotene,zeaxanthin, α-carotene (β,ε-carotene) and lutein. Functional complementation inEscherichia coli demonstrated that BfLCYB is able to catalyze cyclization oflycopene into monocyclic γ-carotene (β,ψ-carotene) and bicyclic β-carotene, andcyclization of the open end of monocyclic δ-carotene (ε,ψ-carotene) to produceα-carotene. No ε-cyclization activity was identified for BfLCYB. Sequencecomparison showed that BfLCYB shares conserved domains with other functionallycharacterized lycopene cyclases from different organisms and belongs to a groupof ancient lycopene cyclases. Although B. fuscopurpurea also synthesizesα-carotene and lutein, its enzyme-catalyzing ε-cyclization is still unknown.","Cao, Tian-Jun, Huang, Xing-Qi, Qu, Yuan-Yuan, Zhuang, Zhong, Deng, Yin-Yin, Lu, Shan",2017,Marine drugs,2

Mesyl Sal B is a potent and selective KOPr analogue ofSalvinorin A (Sal A), a psychoactive natural product isolated from the plantSalvia divinorum. We assessed the antinociceptive, anti-cocaine, and side-effectsof Mesyl Sal B. The anti-cocaine effects are evaluated in cocaine-inducedhyperactivity and behavioral sensitization to cocaine in male Sprague Dawleyrats. Mesyl Sal B was assessed for anhedonia (conditioned taste aversion),aversion (conditioned place aversion), pro-depressive effects (forced swim test),anxiety (elevated plus maze) and learning and memory deficits (novel objectrecognition). In male B6.SJL mice, the antinociceptive effects were evaluated inwarm-water (50 °C) tail withdrawal and intraplantar formaldehyde (2%) assays andthe sedative effects measured with the rotarod performance task. Mesyl Sal B (0.3mg/kg) attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization tococaine without modulating sucrose self-administration and without producingaversion, sedation, anxiety, or learning and memory impairment in rats. However,increased immobility was observed in the forced swim test indicatingpro-depressive effects. Mesyl Sal B was not as potent as Sal A at reducing painin the antinociceptive assays.

Lipidnanosystems have great potential for transdermal drug delivery. Nanoemulsions andnanoemulsion gels were prepared to enhance percutaneous permeation.Microstructure and in vitro/in vivo percutaneous delivery characteristics oftriptolide (TPL)-nanoemulsions and TPL-nanoemulsion gels were compared. Theintegrity of the nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels during transdermal deliveryand its effects on the surface of skin were also investigated. The penetrationmechanisms of nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels were investigated bydifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR). The transport characteristics of fluorescence-labellednanoemulsions were probed using laser scanning confocal microscopy. A chronicdermatitis/eczema model in mice ears and the pharmacodynamic of theTPL-nanoemulsion gels were also investigated. RESULTS: Compared to TPL gels,significantly greater cumulative amounts of TPL-nanoemulsion gels andTPL-nanoemulsions penetrated rat skin in vitro. The in vivo microdialysis showedthe concentration-time curve AUC(0-t) for TPL-NPs is bigger than the TPL-gels. Atthe same time, TPL-NPs had a larger effect on the surface of skin. By hydratingkeratin and changing the structure of both the stratum corneum lipids andkeratin, nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels influence skin to promotepercutaneous drug penetration. Both hairfollicles and the stratum corneum arealso important in this transdermal drug delivery system. Moderate and highdosages of the TPL-nanoemulsion gels can significantly improve the symptoms ofdermatitis/eczema inflammation and edema erythematic in mice ears and can reducethe expression of IFN-γ and IL-4. Moreover, the TPL-nanoemulsion gels cause lessgastrointestinal damage than that of the Tripterygium wilfordii oral tablet does.CONCLUSIONS: Nanoemulsions could be suitable for transdermal stably releasingdrugs and maintaining the effective drug concentration.

Carotenoid profiles and productivitiesvaried in a strain-specific and stress-dependent manner. Our results alsoillustrate that phylogenetically related microalgal strains originating fromdifferent ecological niches present specific interests for the production ofspecific molecules under controlled culture conditions.","Guyon, Jean-Baptiste, Vergé, Valérie, Schatt, Philippe, Lozano, Jean-Claude, Liennard, Marion, Bouget, François-Yves",2018,Marine drugs,2
34556,TA050772,10.3892/mmr.2017.6480,Sclareol inhibits cell proliferation and sensitizes cells to theantiproliferative effect of bortezomib via upregulating the tumor suppressorcaveolin-1 in cervical cancer cells.,"The anticancer effect of sclareol has long been reported, however, the exactmechanisms underlying the antitumorigenic effect of sclareol in cervicalcarcinoma remain to be fully elucidated. The present study analyzed cellproliferation and cell apoptosis by MTT and FITC‑Annexin V assays. The proteinlevels of caveolin‑1 (Cav‑1) and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD)1 weredetermined by western blotting, and the interaction of Cav1 and HSC70 wasinvestigated by co‑immunoprecipitation experiments. The present study found thatsclareol inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Twocancer‑associated proteins, Cav1 and SOD1 were identified as potential targets ofsclareol in HeLa cells. The expression of Cav1 increased when the cells weretreated with sclareol, and the protein level of SOD1 was negatively correlatedwith Cav1. The overexpression of Cav1 enhanced the sensitivity of the HeLa cellsto sclareol treatment and downregulated the protein level of SOD1, whichexhibited potential associations between Cav1 and SOD1. In addition, sclareolsignificantly sensitized several cancer cells to the anticancer effect ofbortezomib by targeting Cav1 and SOD1. Taken together, the results of the presentstudy demonstrated that sclareol inhibited tumor cell growth through theupregulation of Cav1, and provides a potential therapeutic target for humancancer.","Zhang, Ting, Wang, Ting, Cai, Peiling",2017,Molecular medicine reports,2
