Exchange of aromatic amino acidresidues at the enzyme surface by site-directed mutagenesis led to a 4-foldincrease of the yield in preparative scale incubations, which likely results froman increased enzyme stability instead of improved enzyme kinetics.","Lauterbach, Lukas, Hou, Anwei, Dickschat, Jeroen S",2021,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2
TA000321,10.1016/j.dib.2024.110623,Data on terpene content in pre-rolled cone paper infused with terpene-containingflavours based on the formation of a partially soluble precipitate.,"The high volatility of the terpenes contained in flavour-containing terpene (FCT)products causes the loss of these contents during product storage; thus,measuring the loss of FCT content during storage is important to estimate thefinal content. This work provides data on the reduction in FCT content of infusedpre-rolled paper cones after 1 to 7 days of storage. Determination of FCT contentwas based on the formation of a reddish-brown precipitate resulting from thereaction of terpene moiety in FCT with sulphuric acid. Then, the absorbance ofthe precipitate was analysed using the UV-Vis Spectrophotometric method at avisible wavelength of 538 nm. A calibration standard curve was preparedconcerning the concentration of the original FCT sample and used to determine theFCT content in infused pre-rolled paper. The FCT content on the first day ofstorage decreased and increased again after seven days of storage due tocondensation. The data on the FCT content reduction as the effect of additiveadded was also evaluated.","Karangan, Arthur, Rahardjo, Sherwin Wardhana, Widagdo, Antonius Jimmy, Santoso, Shella Permatasari, Ismadji, Suryadi",2024,Data in brief,2
TA000710,10.5826/dpc.1204a202,Investigation on Utility of Some Novel Terpenes on Transungual Delivery ofTerbinafine for the Management of Onychomycosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Onychomycosis is a fungal disorder of the nail which afflicts 5% ofthe population worldwide. The disease is strenuous to cure as it is chronic, hardto eliminate and tends to recur. Topical therapy is at the forefront for thetreatment of many disorders of nail. However, the success rate of topical therapyhas been halted owing to the poor permeation of topical therapeutics acrossdensely keratinized nail barrier. Therefore, ungual drug permeation must beimproved for an effective topical therapy. An approach to achieve this goal wouldbe the use of terpenes from natural sources as potential penetration enhancers.OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed to explore the effectiveness of some novelterpenes as potential penetration enhancers on transungual delivery ofterbinafine. METHODS: Ex-vivo permeation studies were performed by sopping thenail clippings of healthy human volunteers in control and working solutionscontaining terbinafine (5mg/ml) per se and terbinafine (5mg/ml) with 6% of eachterpenes including lavandulol, safranal, rose oxide, limonene,3-methyl-2-butene-1-ol, and linalool respectively for 48 hours. The terbinafineconcentration in nail samples was determined using a HPLC (High PerformanceLiquid Chromatography method. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that studiedterpenes increase transungual penetration of terbinafine in the following order:linalool > rose oxide > 3-methyl-2-butene-1-ol > safranal > limonene > lavandulolacetate. Accordingly, linalool was found to be the most effective penetrationenhancer for the transungual delivery of terbinafine. CONCLUSIONS: It isconcluded that linalool can be used as safe and potential penetration enhancerfor enhancing the transungual delivery of terbinafine for onychomycosis.","Gupta, Isha, Adin, Syeda Nashvia, Aqil, Mohd, Mujeeb, Mohd, Sultana, Yasmin",2022,Dermatology practical & conceptual,2

In such polyenecyclizations, structurally highly complex carbon scaffolds are built by thecontrolled ring closure of linear polyenes. Thereby, multiple C,C bonds andstereocenters are simultaneously created with high precision. Structuralpre-organization of the substrate carbon chain inside the active center of theenzyme is responsible for the product- and stereoselectivity of this cyclization.Here, we show that in-situ formed fluorinated-alcohol-amine supramolecularclusters serve as artificial cyclases by triggering enzyme-like reactivity andselectivity by controlling substrate conformation in solution. Because of thedynamic nature of these supramolecular assemblies, a broad range of terpenes canbe produced diastereoselectively. Mechanistic studies reveal a finely balancedinterplay of fluorinated solvent, catalyst, and substrate as key to establishingnature's concept of a shape-selective polyene cyclization in organic synthesis.","Arnold, Andreas M, Dullinger, Philipp, Biswas, Aniruddha, Jandl, Christian, Horinek, Dominik, Gulder, Tanja",2023,Nature communications,2

Thisstudy presents the first significant production of caryophyllene andcaryolan-1-ol by an engineered E. coli with heterologous expression of mevalonatepathway genes with a caryophyllene synthase and a caryolan-1-ol synthase. Byoptimizing metabolic flux and fermentation parameters, the engineered strainsyielded 449 mg/L of total terpene, including 406 mg/L sesquiterpene with 100 mg/Lcaryophyllene and 10 mg/L caryolan-1-ol. Furthermore, a marine microalgaehydrolysate was used as the sole carbon source for the production ofcaryophyllene and other terpene compounds. Under the optimal fermentationconditions, 360 mg/L of total terpene, 322 mg/L of sesquiterpene, and 75 mg/Lcaryophyllene were obtained from the pretreated algae hydrolysates. The highestyields achieved on the biomass basis were 48 mg total terpene/g algae and 10 mgcaryophyllene/g algae and the caryophyllene yield is approximately ten timeshigher than that from plant tissues by solvent extraction. The study provides asustainable alternative for production of caryophyllene and its alcohol frommicroalgae biomass as potential candidates for next generation aviation fuels.","Wu, Weihua, Liu, Fang, Davis, Ryan W",2018,Metabolic engineering communications,2

TA001390,10.1111/pbi.12525,Metabolic engineering of terpene biosynthesis in plants using a trichome-specifictranscription factor MsYABBY5 from spearmint (Mentha spicata).,"In many aromatic plants including spearmint (Mentha spicata), the sites ofsecondary metabolite production are tiny specialized structures called peltateglandular trichomes (PGT). Having high commercial values, these secondarymetabolites are exploited largely as flavours, fragrances and pharmaceuticals.But, knowledge about transcription factors (TFs) that regulate secondarymetabolism in PGT remains elusive. Understanding the role of TFs in secondarymetabolism pathway will aid in metabolic engineering for increased yield ofsecondary metabolites and also the development of new production techniques forvaluable metabolites. Here, we isolated and functionally characterized a novelMsYABBY5 gene that is preferentially expressed in PGT of spearmint. We generatedtransgenic plants in which MsYABBY5 was either overexpressed or silenced usingRNA interference (RNAi). Analysis of the transgenic lines showed that the reducedexpression of MsYABBY5 led to increased levels of terpenes and thatoverexpression decreased terpene levels. Additionally, ectopic expression ofMsYABBY5 in Ocimum basilicum and Nicotiana sylvestris decreased secondarymetabolite production in them, suggesting that the encoded transcription factoris probably a repressor of secondary metabolism.","Wang, Qian, Reddy, Vaishnavi Amarr, Panicker, Deepa, Mao, Hui-Zhu, Kumar, Nadimuthu, Rajan, Chakravarthy, Venkatesh, Prasanna Nori, Chua, Nam-Hai, Sarojam, Rajani",2016,Plant biotechnology journal,2
TA001428,10.1093/jxb/erp162,Two terpene synthases are responsible for the major sesquiterpenes emitted fromthe flowers of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa).,"Kiwifruit vines rely on bees for pollen transfer between spatially separated maleand female individuals and require synchronized flowering to ensure pollination.Volatile terpene compounds, which are important cues for insect pollinatorattraction, were studied by dynamic headspace sampling in the major green-fleshedkiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) cultivar 'Hayward' and its male pollinator'Chieftain'. Terpene volatile levels showed a profile dominated by thesesquiterpenes alpha-farnesene and germacrene D. These two compounds were emittedby all floral tissues and could be observed throughout the day, with lower levelsat night. The monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene was also detected in flowers but wasemitted predominantly during the day and only from petal tissue. Using afunctional genomics approach, two terpene synthase (TPS) genes were isolated froma 'Hayward' petal EST library. Bacterial expression and transient in planta datacombined with analysis by enantioselective gas chromatography revealed that oneTPS produced primarily (E,E)-alpha-farnesene and small amounts of(E)-beta-ocimene, whereas the second TPS produced primarily (+)-germacrene D.Subcellular localization using GFP fusions showed that both enzymes werelocalized in the cytoplasm, the site for sesquiterpene production. Real-time PCRanalysis revealed that both TPS genes were expressed in the same tissues and atthe same times as the corresponding floral volatiles. The results indicate thattwo genes can account for the major floral sesquiterpene volatiles observed inboth male and female A. deliciosa flowers.","Nieuwenhuizen, Niels J, Wang, Mindy Y, Matich, Adam J, Green, Sol A, Chen, Xiuyin, Yauk, Yar-Khing, Beuning, Lesley L, Nagegowda, Dinesh A, Dudareva, Natalia, Atkinson, Ross G",2009,Journal of experimental botany,2

However, why natureselects this C10-geranyl group remains a question. We conduct synthesis,UV-thermal denaturation, and molecular simulation studies in RNA duplexes andreveal possible reasons behind this natural selection. Among methyl-(C1),dimethylallyl-(C5), geranyl-(C10), and farnesyl-(C15) modified 2-thiouridines,only geranyl-group promotes U:G over U:A pair. Molecular simulation shows all themodified terpene groups point to the minor groove of RNA duplexes. Thediscrimination between U:G and U:A pairs derives from the difference in hydrogenbonding and interactions of the chain with the hydrophobic area in the minorgroove. Geranyl group has perfect length to discriminate U:G and U:A pairs,whereas the others are either too long or too short to achieve the same behavior.This work indicates that geranyl group cannot be replaced by other terpene groupsin promoting codon-specificity.","Haruehanroengra, Phensinee, Vangaveti, Sweta, Ranganathan, Srivathsan V, Mao, Song, Su, Max Daniel, Chen, Alan A, Sheng, Jia",2020,iScience,2
TA002011,10.1038/s41598-019-45532-1,Terpene Synthase Genes Originated from Bacteria through Horizontal Gene TransferContribute to Terpenoid Diversity in Fungi.,"Fungi are successful eukaryotes of wide distribution. They are known as richproducers of secondary metabolites, especially terpenoids, which are importantfor fungi-environment interactions. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is animportant mechanism contributing to genetic innovation of fungi. However, itremains unclear whether HGT has played a role in creating the enormous chemicaldiversity of fungal terpenoids. Here we report that fungi have acquired terpenesynthase genes (TPSs), which encode pivotal enzymes for terpenoid biosynthesis,from bacteria through HGT. Phylogenetic analysis placed the majority of fungaland bacterial TPS genes from diverse taxa into two clades, indicating ancientdivergence. Nested in the bacterial TPS clade is a number of fungal TPS genesthat are inferred as the outcome of HGT. These include a monophyletic clade ofnine fungal TPS genes, designated as BTPSL for bacterial TPS-like genes, fromeight species of related entomopathogenic fungi, including seven TPSs from sixspecies in the genus Metarhizium. In vitro enzyme assays demonstrate that allseven BTPSL genes from the genus Metarhizium encode active enzymes withsesquiterpene synthase activities of two general product profiles. By analyzingthe catalytic activity of two resurrected ancestral BTPSLs and one closelyrelated bacterial TPS, the trajectory of functional evolution of BTPSLs after HGTfrom bacteria to fungi and functional divergence within Metarhizium could betraced. Using M. brunneum as a model species, both BTPSLs and typical fungal TPSswere demonstrated to be involved in the in vivo production of terpenoids,illustrating the general importance of HGT of TPS genes from bacteria as amechanism contributing to terpenoid diversity in fungi.","Jia, Qidong, Chen, Xinlu, Köllner, Tobias G, Rinkel, Jan, Fu, Jianyu, Labbé, Jessy, Xiong, Wangdan, Dickschat, Jeroen S, Gershenzon, Jonathan, Chen, Feng",2019,Scientific reports,2

Itwas revealed that in normal fibroblasts, terpenes induced genes of stressresponse, apoptosis regulation and tissue regeneration. The restoration of theexpression level of some prolongevity genes after fir extract treatment was shownin old cells. In Caco-2 and AsPC-1 cancer cell lines, Abisil induced expressionof both onco-suppressors (members of GADD45, DUSP, and DDIT gene families), andproto-oncogenes (c-Myc, c-Jun, EGR and others).

TA002566,10.1186/s13068-021-01950-w,Further engineering of R. toruloides for the production of terpenes fromlignocellulosic biomass.,"BACKGROUND: Mitigation of climate change requires that new routes for theproduction of fuels and chemicals be as oil-independent as possible. Themicrobial conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks into terpene-based biofuelsand bioproducts represents one such route. This work builds upon previousdemonstrations that the single-celled carotenogenic basidiomycete, Rhodosporidiumtoruloides, is a promising host for the production of terpenes fromlignocellulosic hydrolysates. RESULTS: This study focuses on the optimization ofproduction of the monoterpene 1,8-cineole and the sesquiterpene α-bisabolene inR. toruloides. The α-bisabolene titer attained in R. toruloides was found to beproportional to the copy number of the bisabolene synthase (BIS) expressioncassette, which in turn influenced the expression level of several nativemevalonate pathway genes. The addition of more copies of BIS under a strongerpromoter resulted in production of α-bisabolene at 2.2 g/L from lignocellulosichydrolysate in a 2-L fermenter. Production of 1,8-cineole was found to be limitedby availability of the precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) andexpression of an appropriate GPP synthase increased the monoterpene titerfourfold to 143 mg/L at bench scale. Targeted mevalonate pathway metaboliteanalysis suggested that 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR),mevalonate kinase (MK) and phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) may be pathwaybottlenecks are were therefore selected as targets for overexpression. Expressionof HMGR, MK, and PMK orthologs and growth in an optimized lignocellulosichydrolysate medium increased the 1,8-cineole titer an additional tenfold to1.4 g/L. Expression of the same mevalonate pathway genes did not have as large animpact on α-bisabolene production, although the final titer was higher at2.6 g/L. Furthermore, mevalonate pathway intermediates accumulated in themevalonate-engineered strains, suggesting room for further improvement.CONCLUSIONS: This work brings R. toruloides closer to being able to makeindustrially relevant quantities of terpene from lignocellulosic biomass.","Kirby, James, Geiselman, Gina M, Yaegashi, Junko, Kim, Joonhoon, Zhuang, Xun, Tran-Gyamfi, Mary Bao, Prahl, Jan-Philip, Sundstrom, Eric R, Gao, Yuqian, Munoz, Nathalie, Burnum-Johnson, Kristin E, Benites, Veronica T, Baidoo, Edward E K, Fuhrmann, Anna, Seibel, Katharina, Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo M, Zucker, Jeremy, Nicora, Carrie D, Tanjore, Deepti, Magnuson, Jon K, Skerker, Jeffrey M, Gladden, John M",2021,Biotechnology for biofuels,2
TA002595,10.1093/molbev/msx178,In Planta Recapitulation of Isoprene Synthase Evolution from Ocimene Synthases.,"Isoprene is the most abundant biogenic volatile hydrocarbon compound naturallyemitted by plants and plays a major role in atmospheric chemistry. It has beenproposed that isoprene synthases (IspS) may readily evolve from other terpenesynthases, but this hypothesis has not been experimentally investigated. Weisolated and functionally validated in Arabidopsis the first isoprene synthasegene, AdoIspS, from a monocotyledonous species (Arundo donax L., Poaceae).Phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that AdoIspS and dicots isoprene synthasesmost likely originated by parallel evolution from TPS-b monoterpene synthases.Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated invivo the functional and evolutionaryrelevance of the residues considered diagnostic for IspS function. One of thesepositions was identified by saturating mutagenesis as a major determinant ofsubstrate specificity in AdoIspS able to cause invivo a dramatic change in totalvolatile emission from hemi- to monoterpenes and supporting evolution of isoprenesynthases from ocimene synthases. The mechanism responsible for IspSneofunctionalization by active site size modulation by a single amino acidmutation demonstrated in this study might be general, as the very same aminoacidic position is implicated in the parallel evolution of different short-chainterpene synthases from both angiosperms and gymnosperms. Based on these results,we present a model reconciling in a unified conceptual framework the apparentlycontrasting patterns previously observed for isoprene synthase evolution inplants. These results indicate that parallel evolution may be driven byrelatively simple biophysical constraints, and illustrate the intimate molecularevolutionary links between the structural and functional bases of traits withglobal relevance.","Li, Mingai, Xu, Jia, Algarra Alarcon, Alberto, Carlin, Silvia, Barbaro, Enrico, Cappellin, Luca, Velikova, Violeta, Vrhovsek, Urska, Loreto, Francesco, Varotto, Claudio",2017,Molecular biology and evolution,2

The key benefit ofmutation breeding is the prospect of enhancing one or several characteristics ofa variety without altering the genetic background. In this study, we exposed theseeds of Salvia officinalis to four concentrations of hydrazine hydrate (HZ),i.e., (0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%) for 6 h. The contents of terpenoid compounds inthe S. officinalis plantlets driven from the HZ-treated seeds were determined byGC-MS, which resulted in the identification of a total of 340 phytochemicalcompounds; 163 (87.48%), 145 (84.49%), 65 (97.45%), and 62 (98.32%), from thefour concentrations of HZ (0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%), respectively.

It hasrecently emerged that the genes encoding different natural product pathways maybe organized as biosynthetic gene clusters in plant genomes, with >30 examplesreported so far. Despite superficial similarities with microbes, these clustershave not arisen by horizontal gene transfer, but rather by gene duplication,neofunctionalization, and relocation via unknown mechanisms. Previously wereported that two Arabidopsis thaliana biosynthetic gene clusters are located inregions of the genome that are significantly enriched in transposable elements(TEs). Other plant biosynthetic gene clusters also harbor abundant TEs. TEs canmediate genomic rearrangement by providing homologous sequences that enableillegitimate recombination and gene relocation. Thus, TE-mediated recombinationmay contribute to plant biosynthetic gene cluster formation. TEs may alsofacilitate establishment of regulons. However, a systematic analysis of the TEsassociated with plant biosynthetic gene clusters has not been carried out. Herewe investigate the TEs associated with clustered terpene biosynthetic genes inmultiple plant genomes and find evidence to suggest a role for miniatureinverted-repeat transposable elements in cluster formation in eudicots. Throughinvestigation of the newly sequenced Amborella trichopoda, Aquilegia coerulea,and Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi genomes, we further show that the ""block"" mechanism offounding of biosynthetic gene clusters through duplication and diversification ofpairs of terpene synthase and cytochrome P450 genes that is prevalent in theeudicots arose around 90-130 million years ago, after the appearance of the basaleudicots and before the emergence of the superrosid clade.","Boutanaev, Alexander M, Osbourn, Anne E",2018,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2

Despite a long-standing industrial interest, the effectof parameters such as how is yeast pre-treated (extraction with ethanol,plasmolysis with hypertonic NaCl, depletion to cell walls), the polarity of thehydrophobes and the process conditions are still not fully understood. Here, wehave developed thorough analytical protocols to assess how the effects of theabove on S. cerevisiae's morphology, permeability, and encapsulation efficiency,using three differently polar hydrophobes (linalool, 1,6-dihydrocarvone,limonene) and three separate processes (hydrophobes as pure 'oils', waterdispersions, or acetone solutions). The harsher the pre-treatment (depleted >plasmolyzed/extracted > untreated cells), the easier the diffusion into yeastbecame, and the lower both encapsulation efficiency and protection fromevaporation, possibly due to denaturation/removal of lipid-associated (membrane)proteins. More hydrophobic terpenes performed worst in encapsulation as pure'oils' or in water dispersion, but much less of a difference existed in acetone.This indicates the specific advantage of solvents/dispersants for 'difficult'compounds, which was confirmed by principal component analysis; furthering thisconcept, we have used combinations of hydrophobes (e.g., linalool andα-tocopherol), with one acting as solvent/enhancer for the other. Our resultsthus indicate advantages in using untreated yeast and-if necessary-processesbased on solvents/secondary hydrophobes.","Coradello, Giulia, Setti, Chiara, Donno, Roberto, Ghibaudi, Matilde, Catalano, Federico, Tirelli, Nicola",2024,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the vasorelaxanteffect of monoterpenes found in medicinal plants and establish thestructure-activity relationship of rotundifolone and its structural analogues onthe rat superior mesenteric artery. METHODS: Contractions of the vessels wereinduced with 10 μM of phenylephine (Phe) in rings with endothelium. During thetonic phase of the contraction, the monoterpenes (10-8 - 10-3, cumulatively) wereadded to the organ bath. The extent of relaxation was expressed as the percentageof Phe-induced contraction. RESULTS: The results from the present study showedthat both oxygenated terpenes (rotundifolone, (+)-limonene epoxide, pulegoneepoxide, carvone epoxide, and (+)-pulegone) and non-oxygenated terpene((+)-limonene) exhibit relaxation activity. The absence of an oxygenatedmolecular structure was not a critical requirement for the molecule to bebioactive. Also it was found that the position of ketone and epoxide groups inthe monoterpene structures influence the vasorelaxant potency and efficacy. MAJORCONCLUSION: The results suggest that the presence of functional groups in thechemical structure of rotundifolone is not essential for its vasorelaxantactivity.","Cardoso Lima, Tamires, Mota, Marcelo Mendonça, Barbosa-Filho, José Maria, Viana Dos Santos, Márcio Roberto, De Sousa, Damião Pergentino",2012,"Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",2

Like other terpenes, ISO is a highlyvolatile compound that is slightly soluble in water, so its inclusion intocyclodextrins (CDs) is an interesting approach to increase its solubility andbioavailability. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the antiedematogenic andanti-inflammatory activity of isopulegol and a β-cyclodextrin-isopulegolinclusion complex (ISO/β-CD) in rodent models. For the anti-inflammatory activityevaluation, antiedematogenic plethysmometry and acute (peritonitis and pleurisy),as well as chronic (cotton pellet-induced granuloma) anti-inflammatory models,were used. The docking procedure is used to evaluate, analyze, and predict theirbinding mode of interaction with H1 and Cox-2 receptors. The animals (n = 6) weredivided into groups: ISO and ISO/β-CD, negative control (saline), and positivecontrol (indomethacin and promethazine). ISO and ISO/β-CD were able to reduceacute inflammatory activity by decreasing albumin extravasation, leukocytemigration, and MPO concentration, and reducing exudate levels of IL-1β and TNF-α.ISO and ISO/β-CD significantly inhibited edematogenic activity in carrageenan-and dextran-induced paw edema. Moreover, both significantly reduced chronicinflammatory processes, given the lower weight and protein concentration ofgranulomas in the foreign body granulomatous inflammation model. The resultssuggest that the inclusion of ISO in β-cyclodextrins improves its pharmacologicalproperties, with the histamine and prostaglandin pathways as probable mechanismsof inhibition, and also reinforces the anti-inflammatory profile of this terpene.","Ramos, Andreza Guedes Barbosa, de Menezes, Irwin Rose Alencar, da Silva, Maria Sanádia Alexandre, Torres Pessoa, Renata, de Lacerda Neto, Luiz Jardelino, Rocha Santos Passos, Fabíola, Melo Coutinho, Henrique Douglas, Iriti, Marcello, Quintans-Júnior, Lucindo José",2020,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2

It can be assumed thatthese circumstances determine the characteristic features of the chemicalcomposition of local beekeeping products, including propolis. We report, for thefirst time, the chemical composition of propolis from Tenerife (Canary Islands).The volatile emissions of three propolis samples collected from differentapiaries are represented by 162 C(1)-C(20) compounds, of which 144 wereidentified using the HS-SPME/GC-MS technique. The main group of volatiles,consisting of 72 compounds, is formed by terpenoids, which account for 42-68% ofthe total ion current (TIC) of the chromatograms. The next most numerous groupsare formed by C(6)-C(17) alkanes and alkenes (6-32% TIC) and aliphatic C(3)-C(11)carbonyl compounds (7-20% TIC). The volatile emissions also contain C(1)-C(6)aliphatic acids and C(2)-C(8) alcohols, as well as their esters. Peaks of 138organic C(3)-C(34) compounds were recorded in the chromatograms of the etherextracts of the studied propolis. Terpene compounds form the most numerous group,but their number and content in different samples is within very wide limits(9-63% TIC), which is probably due to the origin of the samples from apiarieslocated at different altitudes. A peculiarity of the chemical composition of theextractive substances is the almost complete absence of phenylcarboxylic acidsand flavonoids, characteristic of Apis mellifera propolis from different regionsof Eurasia and North America.

In this study, we used bioinformatics to identify bHLHtranscription factors in L. cubeba, 173 bHLH genes were identified from L. cubebaand divided these into 26 subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis. Themajority of bHLHs in each subfamily shared comparable structures and motifs.While LcbHLHs were unevenly distributed across 12 chromosomes, 10 tandem repeatswere discovered. Expression profiles of bHLH genes in different tissuesdemonstrated that LcbHLH78 is a potential candidate gene for regulatingmonoterpene biosynthesis. LcbHLH78 and the terpene synthase LcTPS42 showedcomparable expression patterns in various tissues and fruit development stages ofL. cubeba. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that LcbHLH78 proteinlocalizes to the nucleus, consistent with a transcription factor function.Importantly, transient overexpression of LcbHLH78 increased geraniol and linalolcontents. Our research demonstrates that LcbHLH78 enhances terpenoidbiosynthesis.

Most plant diterpene synthases(DTSs) possess three α-helical domains (αβγ), which are thought to have arisenfrom the fusion of discrete, ancestral bacterial type I TSs (α) and type II TSs(βγ).

Wild pear species Pyrus betuleafolia usedworldwide as rootstock generally displays valuable pest-resistant traits and is apromising genetic resource for pear breeding. In the current study,transcriptional changes in this wild pear species infested with a polyphagousherbivore Spodoptera litura and the underlying molecular mechanisms were fullyinvestigated. A total of 3,118 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) wereidentified in damaged pear leaf samples. Spodoptera litura larvae infestationactivated complex phytohormonal signaling networks in which jasmonic acid,ethylene, brassinosteroids, cytokinin, gibberellic acid and auxin pathways wereinduced, whereas salicylic acid and abscisic acid pathways were suppressed. AllDEGs associated with growth-related photosynthesis were significantlydownregulated, whereas most DEGs involved in defense-related early signalingevents, transcription factors, green leaf volatiles and volatile terpenes weresignificantly upregulated. The PbeOCS (GWHGAAYT028729), a putative (E)-β-ocimenesynthase gene, was newly identified in P. betuleafolia transcriptome. Theupregulation of PbeOCS in S. litura-infested pear leaves supports a potentialrole for PbeOCS in herbivore-induced plant defenses. In enzyme-catalyzedreaction, recombinant PbeOCS utilized only geranyl pyrophosphate but not neryldiphosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl diphosphate as a substrate,producing (E)-β-ocimene as the major product and a trace amount of (Z)-β-ocimene.Moreover, as a catalytic product of PbeOCS, (E)-β-ocimene showed repellenteffects on larvae of S. litura in dual-choice bioassays. What is more,(E)-β-ocimene increased mortalities of larvae in no-choice bioassays.

Dryopteris fragrans is a medicinal plant rich terpenoids. In thisstudy, the function of the gene was verified in vitro and in vivo, the promoterof the gene was amplified and its transcriptional activity was analyzed. In thepresent study, we report the molecular cloning and functional characterization ofDfFPS1 and DfFPS2, two FPS genes from D. fragrans. We found that the two geneswere evolutionarily conserved. Both DfFPS genes were highly expressed in thegametophyte and mature sporophyte leaves, and their expression levels increasedin response to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and high temperature. Both DfFPS proteinswere localized in the cytoplasm and could catalyze FPP synthesis in vitro. Wealso found that the overexpression of DfFPS genes in tobacco plants promotedsecondary metabolite accumulation but exhibited negligible effect on plant growthand development. However, the transgenic plants exhibited tolerance to hightemperature and drought. The promoters of the two genes were amplified usingfusion primer and nested integrated polymerase chain reaction (FPNI-PCR). Thepromoter sequences were truncated and their activity was examined using theβ-glucuronidase (GUS) gene reporter system in tobacco leaves, and we found thatboth genes were expressed in the stomata. The transcriptional activity of thepromoters was found to be similar to the expression pattern of the genes, and thetranscriptional core regions of the two genes were mainly between -943 bp and-740 bp of proDfFPS1. Therefore, we present a preliminary study on the functionand transcriptional activity of the FPS genes of D. fragrans and provide a basisfor the regulation of terpene metabolism in D. fragrans. The results also providea novel basis for the elucidation of terpene metabolic pathways in ferns.","Zhang, Dongrui, Tang, Xun, Chen, Lingling, Qiu, Xiaojie, Song, Chunhua, Wang, Hemeng, Chang, Ying",2023,Frontiers in plant science,2
TA005146,10.1021/jacs.2c11170,Generation of Alternate Indole Diterpene Architectures in Two Species ofAspergilli.,"The significant structural diversity and potent bioactivity of the fungal indolediterpenes (IDTs) has attracted considerable interest in their biosynthesis.Although substantial skeletal diversity is generated by the action ofnoncanonical terpene cyclases, comparatively little is known about these enzymes,particularly those involved in the generation of the subgroup containing emindoleSA and DA, which show alternate terpenoid skeletons. Here, we describe the IDTbiosynthetic machinery generating these unusual IDT architectures fromAspergillus striatus and Aspergillus desertorum. The function of four putativecyclases was interrogated via heterologous expression. Two specific cyclases wereidentified that catalyze the formation of epimers emindole SA and DA from A.striatus and A. desertorum, respectively. These cyclases are both clustered alongwith all the elements required for basic IDT biosynthesis yet catalyze an unusualMarkovnikov-like cyclization cascade with alternate stereochemical control. Theiridentification reveals that these alternate architectures are not generated bymechanistically sloppy or promiscuous enzymes, but by cyclases capable ofdelivering precise regio- and stereospecificities.","Bundela, Rudranuj, Cameron, Rosannah C, Singh, A Jonathan, McLellan, Rose M, Richardson, Alistair T, Berry, Daniel, Nicholson, Matthew J, Parker, Emily J",2023,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2

A commercial citrus EO-Brazilian Orange Terpenes (BOT)-was fractionatedby vacuum fractional distillation to separate BOT into various fractions: F1, F2,F3, and F4. Next, the chemical composition and biological activities of BOT andits fractions were characterized. Results showed the three first fractions had ahigh relative amount of limonene (≥10.86), even higher than the whole BOT.Conversely, F4 presented a larger relative amount of BOT's minor compounds(carvone, cis-carveol, trans-carveol, cis-p-Mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol, andtrans-p-Mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol) and a very low relative amount of limonene(0.08-0.13). Antibacterial activity results showed F4 was the only fractionexhibiting this activity, which was selective and higher activity on a pathogenicbacterium (E. coli) than on a beneficial bacterium (Lactobacillus sp.). However,F4 activity was lower than BOT. Similarly, F4 displayed the highest antioxidantactivity among fractions (equivalent to BOT). These results indicated thatprobably those minor compounds that detected in F4 would be more involved inconferring the biological activities for this fraction and consequently for thewhole BOT, instead of the major compound, limonene, playing this roleexclusively.","Ambrosio, Carmen M S, Diaz-Arenas, Gloria L, Agudelo, Leidy P A, Stashenko, Elena, Contreras-Castillo, Carmen J, da Gloria, Eduardo M",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

TA006406,10.1186/s12934-021-01543-0,Fermentative production of enantiopure (S)-linalool using a metabolicallyengineered Pantoea ananatis.,"BACKGROUND: Linalool, an acyclic monoterpene alcohol, is extensively used in theflavor and fragrance industries and exists as two enantiomers, (S)- and(R)-linalool, which have different odors and biological properties. Linaloolextraction from natural plant tissues suffers from low product yield. Althoughlinalool can also be chemically synthesized, its enantioselective production isdifficult. Microbial production of terpenes has recently emerged as a novel,environmental-friendly alternative. Stereoselective production can also beachieved using this approach via enzymatic reactions. We previously succeeded inproducing enantiopure (S)-linalool using a metabolically engineered Pantoeaananatis, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria, via theheterologous mevalonate pathway with the highest linalool titer ever reportedfrom engineered microbes. RESULTS: Here, we genetically modified a previouslydeveloped P. ananatis strain expressing the (S)-linalool synthase (AaLINS) fromActinidia arguta to further improve (S)-linalool production. AaLINS was mostlyexpressed as an insoluble form in P. ananatis; its soluble expression level wasincreased by N-terminal fusion of a halophilic β-lactamase from Chromohalobactersp. 560 with hexahistidine. Furthermore, in combination with elevation of theprecursor supply via the mevalonate pathway, the (S)-linalool titer was increasedapproximately 1.4-fold (4.7 ± 0.3 g/L) in comparison with the original strain(3.4 ± 0.2 g/L) in test-tube cultivation with an aqueous-organic biphasicfermentation system using isopropyl myristate as the organic solvent for in situextraction of cytotoxic and semi-volatile (S)-linalool. The most productivestrain, IP04S/pBLAAaLINS-ispA*, produced 10.9 g/L of (S)-linalool in ""dual-phase""fed-batch fermentation, which was divided into a growth-phase and a subsequentproduction-phase. Thus far, this is the highest reported titer in the productionof not only linalool but also all monoterpenes using microbes. CONCLUSIONS: Thisstudy demonstrates the potential of our metabolically engineered P. ananatisstrain as a platform for economically feasible (S)-linalool production andprovides insights into the stereoselective production of terpenes with highefficiency. This system is an environmentally friendly and economically valuable(S)-linalool production alternative. Mass production of enantiopure (S)-linaloolcan also lead to accurate assessment of its biological properties by providing anenantiopure substrate for study.","Nitta, Nobuhisa, Tajima, Yoshinori, Yamamoto, Yoko, Moriya, Mika, Matsudaira, Akiko, Hoshino, Yasushi, Nishio, Yousuke, Usuda, Yoshihiro",2021,Microbial cell factories,2

The short reads were assembled intocontigs using the Trinity software and annotated against the Uniprot database.The reads were de novo assembled into 103,367 contigs, which represented 92.8%transcriptome completeness and a diverse set of Gene Ontology terms. Differentialexpression analysis identified 6151 and 8116 contigs significantly upregulated inthe leaf and root tissues, respectively. In addition, we identified 30 contigsbelonging to the Terpene synthase (TPS) family and demonstrated theirevolutionary relationships to tomato TPS family members. Finally, wecharacterized the expression of S. hispanica TPS members in leaves subjected toabiotic stresses and hormone treatments. Abscisic acid had the most pronouncedeffect on the expression of the TPS genes tested in this study. Our work providesvaluable community resources for future studies aimed at improving and utilizingthe beneficial constituents of this emerging healthy food source.","Wimberley, James, Cahill, Joseph, Atamian, Hagop S",2020,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2

Maton Essential Oil: An Interesting Source of BioactiveSpecialized Metabolites as Inhibitors of Acetylcholinesterase andButyrylcholinesterase.,"Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton (Zingiberaceae family) is a plant traditionallyused in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. In this work, the essential oil of E.cardamomum was found to inhibit the enzymes AChE (62.6% of inhibition, IC(50)24.9 μg/mL) and BChE (55.8% of inhibition, IC(50) 25.9 μg/mL) by performing an invitro colorimetric assay using the Ellman method. A bio-guided fractionationapproach was used to isolate fractions/pure compounds that were testedindividually to evaluate their activity. The resulting oxygenated fraction wasfound to be active against both AChE (percentage inhibition 42.8%) and BChE(percentage inhibition 63.7%), while the hydrocarbon fraction was inactive. Theactivity was attributed to a pool of oxygenated terpenes (α-terpinyl acetate,1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, and α-terpineol) that synergisticallycontributed to the overall activity of the essential oil.","Pavarino, Marta, Marengo, Arianna, Cagliero, Cecilia, Bicchi, Carlo, Rubiolo, Patrizia, Sgorbini, Barbara",2023,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2

TA007945,10.3390/molecules15117603,The biosynthesis of artemisinin (Qinghaosu) and the phytochemistry of Artemisiaannua L. (Qinghao).,"The Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia annua L. (Qinghao) is the only known sourceof the sesquiterpene artemisinin (Qinghaosu), which is used in the treatment ofmalaria. Artemisinin is a highly oxygenated sesquiterpene, containing a unique1,2,4-trioxane ring structure, which is responsible for the antimalarial activityof this natural product. The phytochemistry of A. annua is dominated by bothsesquiterpenoids and flavonoids, as is the case for many other plants in theAsteraceae family. However, A. annua is distinguished from the other members ofthe family both by the very large number of natural products which have beencharacterised to date (almost six hundred in total, including around fiftyamorphane and cadinane sesquiterpenes), and by the highly oxygenated nature ofmany of the terpenoidal secondary metabolites. In addition, this species alsocontains an unusually large number of terpene allylic hydroperoxides andendoperoxides. This observation forms the basis of a proposal that the biogenesisof many of the highly oxygenated terpene metabolites from A. annua - includingartemisinin itself - may proceed by spontaneous oxidation reactions of terpeneprecursors, which involve these highly reactive allyllic hydroperoxides asintermediates. Although several studies of the biosynthesis of artemisinin havebeen reported in the literature from the 1980s and early 1990s, the collectiveresults from these studies were rather confusing because they implied that anunfeasibly large number of different sesquiterpenes could all function as directprecursors to artemisinin (and some of the experiments also appeared tocontradict one another). As a result, the complete biosynthetic pathway toartemisinin could not be stated conclusively at the time. Fortunately, studieswhich have been published in the last decade are now providing a clearer pictureof the biosynthetic pathways in A. annua. By synthesising some of thesesquiterpene natural products which have been proposed as biogenetic precursorsto artemisinin in such a way that they incorporate a stable isotopic label, andthen feeding these precursors to intact A. annua plants, it has now been possibleto demonstrate that dihydroartemisinic acid is a late-stage precursor toartemisinin and that the closely related secondary metabolite, artemisinic acid,is not (this approach differs from all the previous studies, which usedradio-isotopically labelled precursors that were fed to a plant homogenate or acell-free preparation). Quite remarkably, feeding experiments with labeleddihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinic acid have resulted in incorporation oflabel into roughly half of all the amorphane and cadinane sesquiterpenes whichwere already known from phytochemical studies of A. annua. These findingsstrongly support the hypothesis that many of the highly oxygenatedsesquiterpenoids from this species arise by oxidation reactions involving allylichydroperoxides, which seem to be such a defining feature of the chemistry of A.annua. In the particular case of artemisinin, these in vivo results are alsosupported by in vitro studies, demonstrating explicitly that the biosynthesis ofartemisinin proceeds via the tertiary allylic hydroperoxide, which is derivedfrom oxidation of dihydroartemisinic acid. There is some evidence that theautoxidation of dihydroartemisinic acid to this tertiary allylic hydroperoxide isa non-enzymatic process within the plant, requiring only the presence of light;and, furthermore, that the series of spontaneous rearrangement reactions whichthen convert this allylic hydroperoxide to the 1,2,4-trioxane ring of artemisininare  also non-enzymatic in nature.","Brown, Geoffrey D",2010,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

On the basis of the gaschromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis, it was found that thecommercial essential oils revealed considerable differences in terms of thecomposition and diversity of terpenes, terpenoids and sesquiterpenes as comparedwith the extracts obtained from plant material. The commercial clove, oregano,and marjoram oils showed antibacterial properties against all the tested strainsof E. coli. However, these strains were not sensitive to essential oils obtainedfrom the plant material in the process of maceration. The tested strains of E.coli show a high sensitivity, mainly against monoterpenes (α-pinene, β-pinene,α,β,γ-terpinene, limonene) and some terpenoids (thymol, carvacrol). Thecommercial juniper oil contained mainly monoterpenes and monoterpenoids, whilethe extracts contained lower amounts of monoterpenes and high amounts ofsesquiterpenes-the anti-microbiotic properties of the juniper herbal extract seemto be caused by the synergistic activity of mono- and sesquiterpenes.","Białoń, Marietta, Krzyśko-Łupicka, Teresa, Pik, Agnieszka, Wieczorek, Piotr P",2017,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA008121,10.1186/s12934-016-0440-8,Production of the forskolin precursor 11β-hydroxy-manoyl oxide in yeast usingsurrogate enzymatic activities.,"BACKGROUND: Several plant diterpenes have important biological properties. Amongthem, forskolin is a complex labdane-type diterpene whose biological activitystems from its ability to activate adenylyl cyclase and to elevate intracellularcAMP levels. As such, it is used in the control of blood pressure, in theprotection from congestive heart failure, and in weight-loss supplements.Chemical synthesis of forskolin is challenging, and production of forskolin inengineered microbes could provide a sustainable source. To this end, we set outto establish a platform for the production of forskolin and relatedepoxy-labdanes in yeast. RESULTS: Since the forskolin biosynthetic pathway hasonly been partially elucidated, and enzymes involved in terpene biosynthesisfrequently exhibit relaxed substrate specificity, we explored the possibility ofreconstructing missing steps of this pathway employing surrogate enzymes. UsingCYP76AH24, a Salvia pomifera cytochrome P450 responsible for the oxidation ofC-12 and C-11 of the abietane skeleton en route to carnosic acid, we were able toproduce the forskolin precursor 11β-hydroxy-manoyl oxide in yeast. To improve11β-hydroxy-manoyl oxide production, we undertook a chassis engineering effortinvolving the combination of three heterozygous yeast gene deletions (mct1/MCT1,whi2/WHI2, gdh1/GDH1) and obtained a 9.5-fold increase in 11β-hydroxy-manoyloxide titers, reaching 21.2 mg L(-1). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identify asurrogate enzyme for the specific and efficient hydroxylation of manoyl oxide atposition C-11β and establish a platform that will facilitate the synthesis of abroad range of tricyclic (8,13)-epoxy-labdanes in yeast. This platform forms abasis for the heterologous production of forskolin and will facilitate theelucidation of subsequent steps of forskolin biosynthesis. In addition, thisstudy highlights the usefulness of using surrogate enzymes for the production ofintermediates of complex biosynthetic pathways. The combination of heterozygousdeletions and the improved yeast strain reported here will provide a useful toolfor the production of numerous other isoprenoids.","Ignea, Codruta, Ioannou, Efstathia, Georgantea, Panagiota, Trikka, Fotini A, Athanasakoglou, Anastasia, Loupassaki, Sofia, Roussis, Vassilios, Makris, Antonios M, Kampranis, Sotirios C",2016,Microbial cell factories,2

While drought-induced water and carbonlimitations have been implicated in defensive failure and tree susceptibility,evidence demonstrating how these factors interact is scarce. We withheld waterfrom mature, potted Pinus edulis and subsequently applied a double-stem girdle toinhibit carbohydrate transport from the crown and roots. Within this isolatedsegment we then elicited a defense response by inoculating trees with a barkbeetle-fungal symbiont (Ophiostoma sp.). We quantified local mono- andsesquiterpenes (MST), nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC), and pressure potentialof the inner bark. Both drought-stressed and watered trees had similar NSCconcentrations just before inoculation and depleted NSC similarly followinginoculation, yet MST induction (i.e. increased concentration and alteredcomposition) was constrained only in drought-stressed trees. Thus, NSCconsumption was largely unrelated to de novo MST synthesis. Instead,stoichiometric calculations show that induction originated largely from storedresin. Watered trees experiencing higher pressure potentials consistently inducedhigher MST concentrations. We demonstrate the importance of preformed resintoward an induced MST response in a semi-arid conifer where drought-constraintson defense occurred through biophysical limitations (i.e. reduced turgorhindering resin transport) rather than through substrate limitation.","Malone, Shealyn C, Thompson, R Alex, Chow, Pak S, de Oliveira, Celso R Jr, Landhäusser, Simon M, Six, Diana L, McCulloh, Katherine A, Adams, Henry D, Trowbridge, Amy M",2025,The New phytologist,2

We investigated the volatile interactions that take place below groundbetween barley roots and two pathogenic fungi, Cochliobolus sativus and Fusariumculmorum. The volatile molecules emitted by each fungus, by non-infected barleyroots and by barley roots infected with one of the fungi or the two of them wereextracted by head-space solid phase micro extraction and analyzed by gaschromatography mass spectrometry. The effect of fungal volatiles on barley growthand the effect of barley root volatiles on fungal growth were assessed bycultivating both organisms in a shared atmosphere without any physical contact.The results show that volatile organic compounds, especially terpenes, are newlyemitted during the interaction between fungi and barley roots. The volatilemolecules released by non-infected barley roots did not significantly affectfungal growth, whereas the volatile molecules released by pathogenic fungidecreased the length of barley roots by 19 to 21.5% and the surface of aerialparts by 15%. The spectrum of the volatiles released by infected barley roots hadno significant effect on F. culmorum growth, but decreased C. sativus growth by13 to 17%.

Isoprenoid metabolicarchitectures, flux, subcellular localization, and transport dynamics have notyet been fully elucidated in algal hosts. RESULTS: In this study, we investigatedthe accessibility of different isoprenoid precursor pools for C(15)sesquiterpenoid generation in the cytoplasm and chloroplast of Chlamydomonasreinhardtii using the Abies grandis bisabolene synthase (AgBS) as a reporter. Theabundance of the C(15) sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) wasnot increased in the cytosol by co-expression and fusion of AgBS with differentFPP synthases (FPPSs), indicating limited C(5) precursor availability in thecytoplasm. However, FPP was shown to be available in the plastid stroma, wherebisabolene titers could be improved several-fold by FPPSs. Sesquiterpeneproduction was greatest when AgBS-FPPS fusions were directed to the plastid andcould further be improved by increasing the gene dosage. During scale-upcultivation with different carbon sources and light regimes, specificsesquiterpene productivities from the plastid were highest with CO(2) as the onlycarbon source and light:dark illumination cycles. Potential prenyl unittransporters are proposed based on bioinformatic analyses, which may be in partresponsible for our observations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that thealgal chloroplast can be harnessed in addition to the cytosol to exploit the fullpotential of algae as green cell factories for non-native sesquiterpenoidgeneration. Identification of a prenyl transporter may be leveraged for furtherextending this capacity.","Wichmann, Julian, Eggert, Annibel, Elbourne, Liam D H, Paulsen, Ian T, Lauersen, Kyle J, Kruse, Olaf",2022,Microbial cell factories,2
TA012383,10.3390/foods10020391,Transcriptome and Metabolome Dynamics Explain Aroma Differences between Green andRed Prickly Ash Fruit.,"Green prickly ash (Zanthoxylum armatum) and red prickly ash (Zanthoxylumbungeanum) fruit have unique flavor and aroma characteristics that affectconsumers' purchasing preferences. However, differences in aroma components andrelevant biosynthesis genes have not been systematically investigated in greenand red prickly ash. Here, through the analysis of differentially expressed genes(DEGs), differentially abundant metabolites, and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways,we characterize the different aroma components of green and red prickly ashfruits and identify key genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Gaschromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify 41 terpenoids fromgreen prickly ash and 61 terpenoids from red prickly ash. Piperitone was the mostabundant terpenoid in green prickly ash fruit, whereas limonene was most abundantin red prickly ash. Intergroup correlation analysis and redundancy analysisshowed that HDS2, MVK2, and MVD are key genes for terpenoid synthesis in greenprickly ash, whereas FDPS2 and FDPS3 play an important role in the terpenoidsynthesis of red prickly ash. In summary, differences in the composition andcontent of terpenoids are the main factors that cause differences in the aromasof green and red prickly ash, and these differences reflect contrastingexpression patterns of terpenoid synthesis genes.","Fei, Xitong, Qi, Yichen, Lei, Yu, Wang, Shujie, Hu, Haichao, Wei, Anzhi",2021,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2

TA012876,10.1186/s13068-024-02535-z,Efficient synthesis of limonene production in Yarrowia lipolytica bycombinatorial engineering strategies.,"BACKGROUND: Limonene has a variety of applications in the foods, cosmetics,pharmaceuticals, biomaterials, and biofuels industries. In order to meet thegrowing demand for sustainable production of limonene at industry scale, it isessential to find an alternative production system to traditional plantextraction. A promising and eco-friendly alternative is the use of microbes ascell factories for the synthesis of limonene. RESULTS: In this study, theoleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has been engineered to produce D- andL-limonene. Four target genes, l- or d-LS (limonene synthase), HMG (HMG-CoAreductase), ERG20 (geranyl diphosphate synthase), and NDPS1 (neryl diphosphate)were expressed individually or fused together to find the optimal combination forhigher limonene production. The strain expressing HMGR and the fusion proteinERG20-LS was the best limonene producer and, therefore, selected for furtherimprovement. By increasing the expression of target genes and optimizing initialOD, 29.4 mg/L of L-limonene and 24.8 mg/L of D-limonene were obtained. We alsostudied whether peroxisomal compartmentalization of the synthesis pathway wasbeneficial for limonene production. The introduction of D-LS and ERG20 within theperoxisome improved limonene titers over cytosolic expression. Then, the entireMVA pathway was targeted to the peroxisome to improve precursor supply, whichincreased D-limonene production to 47.8 mg/L. Finally, through the optimizationof fermentation conditions, D-limonene production titer reached 69.3 mg/L.CONCLUSIONS: In this work, Y. lipolytica was successfully engineered to producelimonene. Our results showed that higher production of limonene was achieved whenthe synthesis pathway was targeted to the peroxisome, which indicates that thisorganelle can favor the bioproduction of terpenes in yeasts. This study opens newavenues for the efficient synthesis of valuable monoterpenes in Y. lipolytica.","Park, Young-Kyoung, Sellés Vidal, Lara, Bell, David, Zabret, Jure, Soldat, Mladen, Kavšček, Martin, Ledesma-Amaro, Rodrigo",2024,Biotechnology for biofuels and bioproducts,2

However, it is unknown whether its main triterpenoid contentsdiffer in different tissues. In this study, we identified dehydrotumulosic acid,polyporenic acid C, pachymic acid, dehydrotrametenolic acid, and dehydroeburicoicacid as the five main triterpenoids in W. cocos. We also systematically profiledthe contents and distribution of these main triterpenoids in different tissues ofW. cocos. High contents of all five triterpenoids were found in the surface layerof W. cocos. Intriguingly, we noted that the highest contents of the fivetriterpenoids were found in the surface layer of the sclerotium grown underpollution-controlled cultivation; the second-highest contents were found in thesurface layer of the natural sclerotium. These results indicate thatenvironmentally friendly cultivation of the sclerotium of W. cocos is a practicalway to increase the productivity of W. cocos. In addition, our findings suggestthat the triterpenoids may contribute to the pharmacological activity of W.cocos, and the surface layer of sclerotium in W. cocos might be a promising rawmaterial for applications in health care and the development of functionalmedical products.","Fu, Ming, Wang, Li, Wang, Xianyou, Deng, Boxia, Hu, Xing, Zou, Juan",2018,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

However, the molecular process underlying the trichome of A.annua is not yet fully elucidated. In this study, an analysis of multi-tissuetranscriptome data was performed to examine trichome-specific expressionpatterns. A total of 6646 genes were screened and highly expressed in trichomes,including artemisinin biosynthetic genes such as amorpha-4,11-diene synthase(ADS) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1). Mapman and Kyoto Encyclopediaof Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis showed thattrichome-specific genes were mainly enriched in lipid metabolism and terpenoidmetabolism. These trichome-specific genes were analyzed by a weighted geneco-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and the blue module linked to terpenoidbackbone biosynthesis was determined. Hub genes correlated with the artemisininbiosynthetic genes were selected based on TOM value. ORA, Benzoate carboxylmethyltransferase (BAMT), Lysine histidine transporter-like 8 (AATL1),Ubiquitin-like protease 1 (Ulp1) and TUBBY were revealed as key hub genes inducedby methyl jasmonate (MeJA) for regulating artemisinin biosynthesis. In summary,the identified trichome-specific genes, modules, pathways and hub genes provideclues and shed light on the potential regulatory mechanisms of artemisininbiosynthesis in trichomes in A. annua.","Huang, Dawei, Zhong, Guixian, Zhang, Shiyang, Jiang, Kerui, Wang, Chen, Wu, Jian, Wang, Bo",2023,International journal of molecular sciences,2

Leaves.,"N. glutinosa L. is a relatively less studied Nicotiana species (Solanaceae),although there are data about its importance as a model plant in viral controlstudies, as a gene donor in tobacco hybridization and as a source of agents withinsecticidal or fungicidal effects. The biological activities of the species wereassociated mostly with the presence of leaf surface metabolites, in particularditerpenes and sucrose esters. The aim of this study was to identify the chemicalcomposition of the essential oil (EO) and two aromatic extraction products(concrete and resinoid) obtained from N. glutinosa L. leaves. GC-MS analysisidentified 26 components in the EO (representing 97.3% of total oil content),which contained mostly diterpene compounds with major components manool (14.2%),sclarene (8.4%) and manoyl oxide (8.1%). The number of compounds identified inthe concrete was 37 (95.5% of the total content) and the major component was thediterpene alcohol sclareol (14.2%). In the resinoid, 30 volatile components(representing 95.1% of resinoid content) were identified, with major componentsnicotine (32.9%), α-tocopherol (8.2%), tridecanoin (6.9%), sclareol (6.9%), andsolanone (6.9%). The group of bicyclic diterpenes had the largest share in thediterpene fraction of the products (57.3%, 91.7%, and 86.3%, respectively for theEO, concrete, and resinoid). Considering the abundance of sclareol in thearomatic products, the antimicrobial activity of the pure substance wasdetermined. Sclareol was highly effective against a set of medicinally importantyeasts; Candida albicans АТСС 10231, C. glabrata ATCC 90030, C. parapsilosisclinical isolate, and C. tropicalis NBIMCC 23, while being less effective againstthe studied Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Most of the research aimed at characterizing the processes involved inthe formation of terpenoid oil constituents has focused on leaves. We nowdemonstrate, by investigating three mint species, peppermint (Mentha ˣ piperitaL.), spearmint (Mentha spicata L.) and horsemint (Mentha longifolia (L.) Huds.;accessions CMEN 585 and CMEN 584), that other organs - namely stems, rhizomes androots - also emit volatiles and that the terpenoid volatile composition of theseorgans can vary substantially from that of leaves, supporting the notion thatsubstantial, currently underappreciated, chemical diversity exists. Differencesin volatile quantities released by plants whose roots had been dipped in aVerticillium dahliae-spore suspension (experimental) or dipped in water(controls) were evident: increases of some volatiles in the root headspace ofmint species that are susceptible to Verticillium wilt disease (peppermint and M.longifolia CMEN 584) were detected, while the quantities of certain volatilesdecreased in rhizomes of species that show resistance to the disease (spearmintand M. longifolia CMEN 585). To address the genetic and biochemical basisunderlying chemical diversity, we took advantage of the newly sequenced M.longifolia CMEN 585 genome to identify candidate genes putatively coding formonoterpene synthases (MTSs), the enzymes that catalyze the first committed stepin the biosynthesis of monoterpenoid volatiles. The functions of these genes wereestablished by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, purification of thecorresponding recombinant proteins, and enzyme assays, thereby establishing theexistence of MTSs with activities to convert a common substrate, geranyldiphosphate, to (+)-α-terpineol, 1,8-cineole, γ-terpinene, and (-)-bornyldiphosphate, but were not active with other potential substrates. In conjunctionwith previously described MTSs that catalyze the formation of (-)-β-pinene and(-)-limonene, the product profiles of the MTSs identified here can explain thegeneration of all major monoterpene skeletons represented in the volatilesreleased by different mint organs.","Lange, B Markus, Srividya, Narayanan, Lange, Iris, Parrish, Amber N, Benzenberg, Lukas R, Pandelova, Iovanna, Vining, Kelly J, Wüst, Matthias",2023,Frontiers in plant science,2

TA018040,10.1038/s41598-017-05380-3,Universality of the Phytophthora mating hormones and diversity of theirproduction profile.,"Sexual reproduction of the plant pest Phytophthora is regulated by two matinghormones α1 and α2, which are acyclic oxygenated diterpenes first isolated fromP. nicotianae A1 and A2 mating types, respectively. A previous report suggestedthe universality of these factors within this genus. To confirm this concept, weinvestigated 80 strains (19 species) of Phytophthora and a related genus, notonly for the responsiveness to mating hormones but also for their productivity.The results indicated that among the 55 heterothallic strains, 24 (44%) respondedto a mating hormone and 40 (73%) produced one or both hormones. These findingsdemonstrate the interspecies universality of mating hormones within the genusPhytophthora. Hormone productivity was found to be highly diverse and dependenton the strains used. Although the A2 mating type has been regarded as the α2producer, 19 (59%) of the 32 A2-type strains produced both the hormones and twoA2-type strains exclusively produced α1 in high yields. These results indicatethat hormone biosynthesis in Phytophthora is universal but highly diverse andcomplex, and varies with culture conditions, providing us valuable informationfor future studies on the mechanism of mating hormone biosynthesis ofPhytophthora.","Tomura, Tomohiko, Molli, Shylaja D, Murata, Ryo, Ojika, Makoto",2017,Scientific reports,2

Structure-activity relationships using their derivatives were alsoinvestigated. The rhizomes extract of mango ginger, Curcuma amada showedremarkable inhibitory activity in the screening test. Two natural labdanediterpenes 1 and 2 and a drimane sesquiterpene 3 were major constituents isolatedfrom this hexane extract. Among them, (E)-labda-8(17),12-diene-15,16-dial (1) wasthe most prominent compound and showed inhibitory activity against bothα-glucosidase and lipase. Derivatives 4-10 from compound 1 were prepared andevaluated using inhibitory assays with these enzymes. The reduced derivative 4maintained α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, but had decreased pancreatic lipaseinhibitory activity compared with parent compound 1. Other tested derivatives ofcompound 1, including acetates 5-7 and oxidative derivatives 8-10, had very weakα-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Most of these compounds showed moderatepancreatic lipase inhibitory activity. However, only sesquiterpene albicanal (3)showed drastically decreased pancreatic lipase activity compared with 1. Thesefindings suggested that molecular size was essential for enzymatic inhibitoryactivities of these compounds. These results demonstrated that mango ginger maybe useful for the prevention of obesity and being overweight.","Yoshioka, Yuri, Yoshimura, Naori, Matsumura, Shinichi, Wada, Hiroto, Hoshino, Maya, Makino, Shouhei, Morimoto, Masanori",2019,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

The development and production of A. chinensis arenegatively affected by drought stress, especially at the seedling stage.Understanding the molecular mechanism of A. chinensis drought stress responseplays an important role in ensuring medicinal plant production and quality. Inthis study, A. chinensis seedlings were subjected to drought stress treatment for0 (control), 3 (D3), and 9 days (D9). For the control, the sample was wateredevery two days and collected on the second morning after watering. Theintegration of physiological and transcriptomic analyses was carried out toinvestigate the effects of drought stress on A. chinensis seedlings and to revealthe molecular mechanism of its drought stress response. RESULTS: Themalondialdehyde, proline, soluble sugar, and crude protein contents andantioxidative enzyme (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) activitywere significantly increased under drought stress compared with the control.Transcriptomic analysis indicated a total of 215,665 unigenes with an averagelength of 759.09 bp and an N50 of 1140 bp. A total of 29,449 differentiallyexpressed genes (DEGs) were detected between the control and D3, and 14,538 DEGswere detected between the control and D9. Under drought stress, terpenoidbackbone biosynthesis had the highest number of unigenes in the metabolism ofterpenoids and polyketides. To identify candidate genes involved in thesesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthetic pathways, we observed 22unigene-encoding enzymes in the terpenoid backbone biosynthetic pathway and 15unigene-encoding enzymes in the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosyntheticpathways under drought stress. CONCLUSION: Our study provides transcriptomeprofiles and candidate genes involved in sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoidbiosynthesis in A. chinensis in response to drought stress. Our results improveour understanding of how drought stress might affect sesquiterpenoid andtriterpenoid biosynthetic pathways in A. chinensis.","Ma, Shanshan, Sun, Chengzhen, Su, Wennan, Zhao, Wenjun, Zhang, Sai, Su, Shuyue, Xie, Boyan, Kong, Lijing, Zheng, Jinshuang",2024,BMC plant biology,2

This study focused on elucidating the initial secretorycompounds emitted from a live millipede. Pre-concentration of the defensivesecretory volatile organic compounds (VOC) from the live Polidesmida millipedes,Chamberlinius hualienensis and Oxidus gracilis, was performed using a three-stageVOC concentration technique by an on-line GC/MS system. As a result, themonoterpenes derived from the plant metabolite; i.e., α-pinene, α-thujene,β-pinene, 3-carene, β-myrcene, β-phellandrene, γ-terpinene, o,m,p-cymenes,limonene and camphene were first detected as the initial secretory substances. Itwas elucidated that some plant monoterpenes have a repellent effect andantifungal and antibacterial actions which are used as defensive substances. Inaddition, this study also confirmed that these monoterpenes induced apoptoticcell death involved in the induction of the caspase 3/7 activity.

Plants use avariety of chemical and structural mechanisms to defend themselves againstinvading pathogens such as C. zeina, including the production of secondarymetabolites with antimicrobial properties. In maize, a variety of biotic andabiotic stressors induce the accumulation of the terpenoid phytoalexins,zealexins and kauralexins. RESULTS: C. zeina-susceptible line displayed pervasiverectangular grey leaf spot lesions, running parallel with the leaf veins incontrast to C. zeina-resistant line that had restricted disease symptoms.Analysis of the transcriptome of both lines indicated that genes involved inprimary and secondary metabolism were up-regualted, and although differentpathways were prioritized in each line, production of terpenoid compounds werecommon to both. Targeted phytoalexin analysis revealed that C. zeina-inoculatedleaves accumulated zealexins and kauralexins. The resistant line shows apropensity toward accumulation of the kauralexin B series metabolites in responseto infection, which contrasts with the susceptible line that preferentiallyaccumulates the kauralexin A series. Kauralexin accumulation was correlated toexpression of the kauralexin biosynthetic gene, ZmAn2 and a candidatebiosynthetic gene, ZmKSL2. We report the expression of a putative copalyldiphosphate synthase gene that is induced by C. zeina in the resistant lineexclusively. DISCUSSION: This study shows that zealexins and kauralexins, andexpression of their biosynthetic genes, are induced by C. zeina in both resistantand susceptible germplasm adapted to the southern African climate. The datapresented here indicates that different forms of kauralexins accumulate in theresistant and susceptible maize lines in response to C. zeina, with theaccumulation of kauralexin B compounds in a resistant maize line and kauralexin Acompounds accumulating in the susceptible line.","Meyer, Jacqueline, Berger, Dave K, Christensen, Shawn A, Murray, Shane L",2017,BMC plant biology,2

However, thelack of aroma in its cut-flower varieties greatly limits the sustainabledevelopment of the Oncidium hybridum cut-flowers industry. This paper is anintegral investigation of the diel pattern and influencing factors of the aromarelease of Oncidium Twinkle 'Red Fantasy'. GC-MS analysis revealed that therelease of 3-Carene peaked at 10:00, while Butyl tiglate and Prenyl senecioatedid so at 14:00, with a diel rhythm. By analyzing the correlation network betweenaroma component synthesis and differentially expressed genes, 15 key structuralgenes were detected and regulated by multiple circadian rhythm-relatedtranscription factors. Cluster-17371.18_TPS, Cluster-65495.1_TPS,Cluster-46699.0_TPS, Cluster-60935.10_DXS, Cluster-47205.4_IDI, andCluster-65313.7_LOX were key genes in the terpenoid and fatty acid derivativebiosynthetic pathway, which were co-expressed with aroma release. Constantlight/dark treatments revealed that the diurnal release of 3-Carene may beinfluenced by light and the circadian clock, and Butyl tiglate and Prenylsenecioate may be mainly determined by endogenous circadian clock. Under constantlight treatment, the TPS, DXS, IDI, and LOX genes seem to lose their regulatoryrole in the release of aroma compounds from Oncidium Twinkle 'Red Fantasy'. Underconstant dark treatment, the TPS genes were consistent with the release patternof 3-Carene, which may be a key factor in regulating the diel rhythm of 3-Carenebiosynthesis. These results laid a theoretical foundation for the study of floraltranscriptional regulation and genetic engineering technology breeding ofOncidium hybridum.","Chen, Yan, Zhong, Shengyuan, Kong, Lan, Fan, Ronghui, Xu, Yan, Chen, Yiquan, Zhong, Huaiqin",2024,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA023894,10.3390/molecules24020350,Inhibition of T Cell Receptor Activation by Semi-Synthetic Sesquiterpene LactoneDerivatives and Molecular Modeling of Their Interaction with Glutathione andTyrosine Kinase ZAP-70.,"A variety of natural compounds have been shown to modulate T cell receptor (TCR)activation, including natural sesquiterpene lactones (SLs). In the presentstudies, we evaluated the biological activity of 11 novel semi-synthetic SLs todetermine their ability to modulate TCR activation. Of these compounds, α-epoxyarglabin, cytisinyl epoxyarglabin, 1 β ,10 α -epoxyargolide, andchloroacetate grosheimin inhibited anti-CD3-induced Ca(2+) mobilization andextracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in Jurkat Tcells. We also found that the active SLs depleted intracellular glutathione (GSH)in Jurkat T cells, supporting their reactivity towards thiol groups. Because thezeta-chain associated tyrosine kinase 70 kDa (ZAP-70) is essential for TCRsignaling and contains a tandem SH2 region that is highly enriched with multiplecysteines, we performed molecular docking of natural SLs and their semi-syntheticderivatives into the ZAP-70 binding site. The docking showed that the distancebetween the carbon atom of the exocyclic methylene group and the sulfur atom inCys39 of the ZAP-70 tandem SH2 module was 3.04⁻5.3 Å for active compounds.Furthermore, the natural SLs and their derivatives could be differentiated bytheir ability to react with the Cys39 SH-group. We suggest that natural and/orsemi-synthetic SLs with an α -methylene- γ -lactone moiety can specificallytarget GSH and the kinase site of ZAP-70 and inhibit the initial phases of TCRactivation.","Khlebnikov, Andrei I, Schepetkin, Igor A, Kishkentaeva, Anarkul S, Shaimerdenova, Zhanar R, Atazhanova, Gayane A, Adekenov, Sergazy M, Kirpotina, Liliya N, Quinn, Mark T",2019,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA025173,10.3325/cmj.2015.56.431,Effects of d- and l-limonene on the pregnant rat myometrium in vitro.,"AIM: To study the effects of d- and l-limonene on pregnant rat myometrialcontractility in vitro, and investigate how these effects are modified by otheragents. D- and l-limonene (10(-13)-10(-8) M) caused myometrial contraction in adose-dependent manner. METHODS: Contractions of uterine rings from22-day-pregnant rats were measured in an organ bath in the presence of d- orl-limonene (10(-13)-10(-8) M) and nifedipine (10(-8) M), tetraethyl-ammonium(10(-3) M), theophylline (10(-5) M), or paxilline (10(-5) M). Uterine cyclicadenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level was detected by enzyme immunoassay.Oxidative damage was induced by methylglyoxal (3×10(-2) M) and the alteration wasmeasured via noradrenaline (1×10(-9) to 3×10(-5) M) -induced contractions.RESULTS: Pre-treatment with nifedipine (10(-8) M), tetraethylammonium (10(-3) M),and theophylline (10(-5) M) attenuated the contracting effect of d- andl-limonene, while in the presence of paxilline (10(-5) M) d- and l-limonene wereineffective. The two enantiomers decreased the myometrial cAMP level, but afterpaxilline pretreatment the cAMP level was not altered compared with the controlvalue. Additionally, l-limonene (10(-6) M) diminished consequences of oxidativedamage caused by methylglyoxal (3×10(-2) M) on contractility, whereas d-limonenewas ineffective. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that l-limonene has anantioxidant effect and that both d-and l-limonene cause myometrial contractionthrough activation of the A2A receptor and opening of the voltage-gated Ca(2+)channel. It is possible that limonene-containing products increase the pregnantuterus contractility and their use should be avoided during pregnancy.","Hajagos-Tóth, Judit, Hódi, Ágnes, Seres, Adrienn B, Gáspár, Róbert",2015,Croatian medical journal,2

The present study compared dedifferentiated cells (DDCs)and cambial meristematic cells (CMCs) cell cultures of R. glutinosa for terpenoid(catalpol) and indole alkaloid (IA) biosynthesis. In this regard, we used widelytargeted metabolomics and transcriptome sequencing approaches together with thecomparison of cell morphology, cell death (%), and catalpol production atdifferent time points. RESULTS: We were able to identify CMCs based on theirmorphology and hypersensitivity to zeocin. CMCs showed higher dry weight contentand better catalpol production compared to DDCs. The metabolome analysis revealedhigher concentrations of IA, terpenoids, and catalpol in CMCs compared to DDCs.The transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that a total of 27,201 genesenriched in 139 pathways were differentially expressed. The higher catalpolconcentration in CMCs is related to the expression changes in genes involved inacetyl-CoA and geranyl-PP biosynthesis, which are precursors for monoterpenoidbiosynthesis. Moreover, the expressions of the four primary genes involved inmonoterpenoid biosynthesis (NMD, CYP76A26, UGT6, and CYP76F14), along with asqualene monooxygenase, exhibit a strong association with the distinct catalpolbiosynthesis. Contrarily, expression changes in AADC, STR, and RBG genes wereconsistent with the IA biosynthesis. Finally, we discussed the phytohormonesignaling and transcription factors in relation to observed changes inmetabolome. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study provides novel data for improving thecatalpol and IA biosynthesis in R. glutinosa.","Zhou, Pengfei, Li, Haihua, Lin, Yujin, Zhou, Yujun, Chen, Yinzi, Li, Yiheng, Li, Xuan, Yan, Hui, Lin, Weiming, Xu, Beilu, Deng, Huiting, Qiu, Xiaoqi",2023,BMC plant biology,2

Catharanthus roseus is the sole known producer of theanti-cancer terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs), vinblastine and vincristine. Whilethe enzymatic steps of the pathway have been elucidated, an understanding of itsregulation is still emerging. The present study characterizes an importantsubgroup of Cys2-His2 zinc finger transcription factors known as Zinc fingerCatharanthus Transcription factors (ZCTs). We identified three new ZCT members(named ZCT4, ZCT5, and ZCT6) that clustered with the putative repressors of theTIA pathway, ZCT1, ZCT2, and ZCT3. We characterized the role of these six ZCTs aspotential redundant regulators of the TIA pathway, and their tissue-specific andjasmonate-responsive expression. These ZCTs share high sequence conservation intheir two Cys2-His2 zinc finger domains but differ in the spacer length andsequence between these zinc fingers. The transient overexpression of ZCTs inseedlings significantly repressed the promoters of the terpenoid (pLAMT) andcondensation branch (pSTR1) of the TIA pathway, consistent with that previouslyreported for ZCT1, ZCT2, and ZCT3. In addition, ZCTs significantly repressed andindirectly activated several promoters of the vindoline pathway (not previouslystudied). The ZCTs differed in their tissue-specific expression but similarlyincreased with jasmonate in a dosage-dependent manner (except for ZCT5). Weshowed significant activation of the pZCT1 and pZCT3 promoters by thede-repressed CrMYC2a, suggesting that the jasmonate-responsive expression of theZCTs can be mediated by CrMYC2a. In summary, the C. roseus ZCTs arejasmonate-responsive, can be induced by CrMYC2a, and can act as significantregulators of the TIA pathway when highly expressed.","Traverse, Krystyna K F, Breselge, Samuel, Trautman, Juliet G, Dee, Amanda, Wang, Jie, Childs, Kevin L, Lee-Parsons, Carolyn W T",2024,Plant cell reports,2

Although sesquiterpenes are well-known to be biosynthesized bysesquiterpene synthases (TPSs), to date, only a few TPS genes involved inagarwood formation have been reported. Here, two new TPS genes, namely, TPS9 andTPS12, were isolated from Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Gilg, and their functionswere examined in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), with farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)and geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) as the substrate of the corresponding enzymeactivities. They were both identified as a multiproduct enzymes. After incubationwith FPP, TPS9 liberated β-farnesene and cis-sesquisabinene hydrate as mainproducts, with cedrol and another unidentified sesquiterpene as minor products.TPS12 catalyzes the formation of β-farnesene, nerolidol, γ-eudesmol, and hinesol.After incubation with GPP, TPS9 generated citronellol and geraniol as mainproducts, with seven minor products. TPS12 converted GPP into four monoterpenes,with citral as the main product, and three minor products. Both TPS9 and TPS12showed much higher expression in the two major tissues emitting floral volatiles:flowers and agarwood. Further, RT-PCR analysis showed TPS9 and TPS12 are typicalgenes mainly expressed during later stages of stress response, which is betterknown than that of chromone derivatives. This study will advance ourunderstanding of agarwood formation and provide a solid theoretical foundationfor clarifying its mechanism in A. sinensis.","Yu, Cuicui, Gao, Shixi, Rong, Mei, Xiao, Mengjun, Xu, Yanhong, Wei, Jianhe",2023,PeerJ,2
TA026807,10.1080/13880209.2016.1228682,Antinociceptive and anticonvulsant effects of the monoterpene linalool oxide.,"CONTEXT: Linalool oxide (OXL) (a monoterpene) is found in the essential oils ofcertain aromatic plants, or it is derived from linalool. The motivation for thiswork is the lack of psychopharmacological studies on this substance. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate OXL's acute toxicity, along with its anticonvulsant andantinociceptive activities in male Swiss mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: OXL (50, 100and 150 mg/kg, i.p.) was investigated for acute toxicity and in the Rota-rodtest. Antinociceptive activity was evaluated by the acetic acid-induced writhingtest, and by formalin testing. Anticonvulsant effects were demonstrated bytesting for pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures and by Maximum Electroshockheadset (MES) test. OXL was administered to the animals intraperitoneally 30 minbefore for pharmacological tests. RESULTS: OXL showed an LD(50) of ∼721 (681-765)mg/kg. In the Rota-rod test, it was observed that OXL caused no damage to theanimal's motor coordination. OXL significantly reduced (p < .001) the number ofwrithings. OXL also significantly decreased (p < .05, p < .01 or p < .001)paw-licking time in the two phases of the formalin test.

TA027334,10.1186/s12896-020-00662-7,Effectiveness of recombinant Escherichia coli on the production of(R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol.,"BACKGROUND: (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol is a naturally oxygenated monoterpene widelyused as the natural flavor additives, insecticides, jet fuels and anti-cancertherapies. It was also readily available monoterpene precursors. However, thisnatural product is present at low concentrations from plant sources which are noteconomically viable. Therefore, alternative microbial production methods arerapidly emerging as an attractive alternative to make (R)-(+)-perillyl alcoholproduction more sustainable and environmentally friendly. RESULTS: We engineeredEscherichia coli to possess a heterologous mevalonate (MVA) pathway, includinglimonene synthase, P-cymene monoxygenase hydroxylase and P-cymene monoxygenasereductase for the production of (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol. The concentration of(R)-(+)-limonene (the monoterpene precursor to (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol) reached45 mg/L from glucose. Enhanced (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol production was thereforeachieved. The strain produced (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol at a titer of 87 mg/L anda yield of 1.5 mg/g glucose in a 5 L bioreactor fed batch system. CONCLUSIONS:These datas highlight the efficient production of (R)-(+)-perillyl alcoholthrough the mevalonate pathway from glucose.

TA027570,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03492,The hydroxyl moiety on carbon one (C1) in the monoterpene nucleus of thymol isindispensable for anti-bacterial effect of thymol.,"BACKGROUND: Thymol, a natural monoterpene phenol is not only relevant clinicallyas an anti-microbial, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent but also holds theprospect as a natural template for pharmaceutical semi-synthesis of therapeuticagents. It is a major component of essential oils from many plants. Evidenceabound linking overall bioactivity of thymol to its monoterpene nucleus,specifically, the hydroxyl (-OH) substituent on carbon number one (C1) on themonoterpene nucleus. Other studies have posited that the overall bioactivity ofthymol is not substantially altered by chemical modification of - OH on the C1 ofthe monoterpene nucleus. In view of this, it is still unclear as to whetherremoval or modification of the -OH on C1 of the monoterpene nucleus relatesgenerally or context-dependently to bioactivity of thymol. OBJECTIVE: The presentstudy investigated anti-bacterial effects of ester-and-ether substitutedderivatives of thymol on S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. coli. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: twelve ester-and-ether substituted derivatives of thymol (6TM1s and6TM2s) were synthesized and characterized by using HPLC, Mass spectrometry, andIR techniques. Anti-bacterial activity of the 12 thymol derivatives was evaluatedusing broth macrodilution and turbidimetric methods against pure clinicalisolates (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. coli). Standard anti-biotics used wereThymol Streptomycin and flucloxacillin, while DMSO was used as vehicle for thymolderivatives. MIC and MBC were determined. RESULTS: Thymol produced broad-spectrumgrowth inhibition on all isolates. At equimolar concentrations, thymol andreference drugs produced concentration-dependent growth inhibition against theisolates (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli)compared to DMSO. Although the growth inhibitory effects of the ester-and-etherderivatives of thymol was significant (P ≤ 0.05) compared to DMSO, it was howeverinsignificant (P ≥ 0.05) compared to thymol and reference antibiotics.Comparatively, at equimolar concentrations, ester-substituted derivatives ofthymol, particularly the branched chain derivative (TM1C) produced more effectivegrowth inhibition on the isolates than the ether-substituted derivatives ofthymol. Thymol was twice as potent (MIC and MBC, 500 μg/ml) than bothester-and-ether substituted derivatives of thymol (MIC and MBC, > 1000 μg/ml) onall the three clinical isolates. Increase in side chain bulkiness of -OH moietyon the monoterpene nucleus of thymol decreased growth inhibition on isolates.CONCLUSION: Thymol has demonstrated broad-spectrum anti-bacterial effectsattributable to the hydroxyl moiety on C1 of the monoterpene nucleus. Structuralmodification of the hydroxyl moiety on C1 of the monoterpene nucleus of thymolwith either ether-or-ester substitutions yielded no significant anti-bacterialeffects.","Boye, Alex, Addo, Justice Kwaku, Acheampong, Desmond Omane, Thomford, Ama Kyeraa, Asante, Emmanuel, Amoaning, Regina Elorm, Kuma, Dominic Nkwantabisa",2020,Heliyon,2
TA027742,10.1186/s12864-016-3409-4,Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals candidate genes for the biosynthesisof natural insecticide in Tanacetum cinerariifolium.,"BACKGROUND: Pyrethrins are monoterpenoids and consist of either a chrysanthemicacid or pyrethric acid with a rethrolone moiety. Natural pyrethrins are safe andeco-friendly while possessing strong insecticidal properties. Despite suchadvantages of commercial value coming with the eco-friendly tag, mostenzymes/genes involved in the pyrethrin biosynthesis pathway remain unidentifiedand uncharacterized. Since the flowers of Tanacetum cinerariifolium are rich inmajor pyrethrins, next generation transcriptome sequencing was undertaken tocompare the flowers and the leaves of the plant de novo to identifydifferentially expressed transcripts and ascertain which among them might beinvolved in and responsible for the differential accumulation of pyrethrins in T.cinerariifolium flowers. RESULTS: In this first tissue specific transcriptomeanalysis of the non-model plant T. cinerariifolium, a total of 23,200,000 and28,500,110 high quality Illumina next generation sequence reads, with a length of101 bp, were generated for the flower and leaf tissue respectively. Afterfunctional enrichment analysis and GO based annotation using public proteindatabases such as UniRef, PFAM, SMART, KEGG and NR, 4443 and 8901 unigenes wereidentified in the flower and leaf tissue respectively. These could be assigned to13344 KEGG pathways and the pyrethrin biosynthesis contextualized. The2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway was involved in thebiosynthesis of acid moiety of pyrethrin and this pathway predominated in theflowers as compared to the leaves. However, enzymes related to oxylipinbiosynthesis were found predominantly in the leaf tissue, which suggested thatmajor steps of pyrethrin biosynthesis occurred in the flowers. CONCLUSIONS:Transcriptome comparison between the flower and leaf tissue of T. cinerariifoliumprovided an elaborate list of tissue specific transcripts that was useful inelucidating the differences in the expression of the biosynthetic pathwaysleading to differential presence of pyrethrin in the flowers. The informationgenerated on genes, pathways and markers related to pyrethrin biosynthesis inthis study will be helpful in enhancing the production of these useful compoundsfor value added breeding programs. Related proteome comparison to overlay ourtranscriptome comparison can generate more relevant information to betterunderstand flower specific accumulation of secondary metabolites in general andpyrethrin accumulation in particular.","Khan, Sana, Upadhyay, Swati, Khan, Feroz, Tandon, Sudeep, Shukla, Rakesh Kumar, Ghosh, Sumit, Gupta, Vikrant, Banerjee, Suchitra, Ur Rahman, Laiq",2017,BMC genomics,2

Plena, a cultivar of Rosa rugosa, has a history ofmore than 1300 years of application in both medicine and food in China. Theessential oil of Rosa rugosa cv. Plena (PREO) is one of the most frequently usedadditives in food, cosmetics and aromatherapy. PREO exhibits someanti-inflammation, antioxidant and nerve alleviating effects. However, themechanisms behind these effects are still unclear. METHODS: The composition ofPREO was determined by GC‒MS. Network pharmacology was performed to predict thepossible compound-target network and analyze the possible targets againstinflammation and oxidative stress. An inflammatory immune cell model wasconstructed by exposing RAW 264.7 cells to LPS. A series of experiments,including biochemical assays, RT‒PCR, and western blotting, were conducted toinvestigate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of PREO. RESULTS:PREO treatment significantly (p < 0.05) alleviated inflammatory and oxidativebiomarkers such as NO, ROS, and MDA and preserved SOD and CAT activities. GC‒MSanalysis revealed that PREO consists of 57 compounds, mainly monoterpenoids.Network pharmacology revealed that citronellol, farnesol, ethyl octanoate,geranyl acetate, and methyl eugenol were active components interacting withseveral inflammatory pathway proteins. By measuring the gene and proteinexpression of possible targets by qRT‒PCR and western blotting, PREOanti-inflammatory responses in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells might be associatedwith the regulation of NF-κB signaling. Molecular docking showed that PREOcomponents can interact with different proteins involved in the NF-κB pathway.CONCLUSION: The integrated study of molecular analysis and network pharmacologysuggested that PREO might be a potential anti-inflammatory agent to treatinflammation and oxidative stress.","Raka, Rifat Nowshin, Zhiqian, Ding, Yue, Yuan, Luchang, Qiao, Suyeon, Park, Junsong, Xiao, Hua, Wu",2022,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2

However, there is still much that remainsunknown about the potential risk and harms of vaping. Formation of oxidativeproducts is one of such areas that are not well understood. In this study, weused an in-situ thermal desorption GC/MS method to investigate the formation ofoxidative products of several monoterpenes at or below typical vapingtemperatures. Among the five tested monoterpenes, the unchanged portion of theparent compound in the vapour varied from 97 to 98% for myrcene to 11-28% forterpinolene. The majority of formed oxidative products in the vapour have amolecular weight of 134 (loss of two hydrogens), 150 (insertion of one oxygen andloss of two hydrogen atoms) or 152 (insertion of one oxygen atom). Threeproducts, likely to be p-(1-propenyl)-toluene, β-pinone and fenchol were alsoobserved. This is the first in-situ thermal desorption GC/MS study to investigatethe possible formation of oxidative products of monoterpenes, one of the majorcomponents in vaping liquids, at temperatures that are relevant to the vapingprocess. Although the toxicity of inhaling these oxidative products is not clearyet, allergic and irritation reactions associated with oxidized monoterpene oilsare well documented. Therefore, potential adverse effects of inhaling theseoxidative products during vaping could be investigated to help support human riskassessment.","Zhu, Jiping, Niu, Jianjun, Das, Dharani, Cabecinha, Ashley, Abramovici, Hanan",2022,Scientific reports,2
TA031765,10.1073/pnas.2211254119,Biosynthesis of iridoid sex pheromones in aphids.,"Iridoid monoterpenes, widely distributed in plants and insects, have manyecological functions. While the biosynthesis of iridoids has been extensivelystudied in plants, little is known about how insects synthesize these naturalproducts. Here, we elucidated the biosynthesis of the iridoidscis-trans-nepetalactol and cis-trans-nepetalactone in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphonpisum (Harris), where they act as sex pheromones. The exclusive production ofiridoids in hind legs of sexual female aphids allowed us to identify iridoidgenes by searching for genes specifically expressed in this tissue. Biochemicalcharacterization of candidate enzymes revealed that the iridoid pathway in aphidsproceeds through the same sequence of intermediates as described for plants. Thesix identified aphid enzymes are unrelated to their counterparts in plants,conclusively demonstrating an independent evolution of the entire iridoid pathwayin plants and insects. In contrast to the plant pathway, at least three of theaphid iridoid enzymes are likely membrane bound. We demonstrated that a lipidenvironment facilitates the cyclization of a reactive enol intermediate to theiridoid cyclopentanoid-pyran scaffold in vitro, suggesting that membranes are anessential component of the aphid iridoid pathway. Altogether, our discovery ofthis complex insect metabolic pathway establishes the genetic and biochemicalbasis for the formation of iridoid sex pheromones in aphids, and this discoveryalso serves as a foundation for understanding the convergent evolution of complexmetabolic pathways between kingdoms.","Köllner, Tobias G, David, Anja, Luck, Katrin, Beran, Franziska, Kunert, Grit, Zhou, Jing-Jiang, Caputi, Lorenzo, O'Connor, Sarah E",2022,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2

Production of FCdiene using a genetically modified Saccharomycescerevisiae has been previously demonstrated with batch cultivations with aproduct concentration up to 10 mg/L. However, it is widely known that fed-batchprocesses can significantly improve product titer in yeast fermentations. Thisstudy focuses on the establishment of fed-batch fermentation for FCdieneproduction because fed-batch cultivations using FeedBeads(®) indicated thatlimiting glucose supply could increase yields of biomass (1.07 g(CDW)/g(Glucose)instead of 0.20 g(CDW)/g(Glucose)) and FCdiene (21.54 mg(FCdiene)/g(Glucose)instead of 9.74 mg(FCdiene)/g(Glucose)) in shake flask scale and may haveimplications for larger scale processes. We implemented a new exponential glucosefeed profile in a 1.8 L stirred tank reactor. This reduced overfeeding and theconsequent, ethanol production. As a result improvements in cell concentrationsup to 246% could be achieved and FCdiene yield increased up to 2.8X in the first28 h. FCdiene concentration reached 161 mg/L and 320 mg/L at 44 h. Fed-batch andbatch mode were combined to examine dynamics of bi-modal cultivation where afed-batch phase was used for biomass production and a batch phase used forFCdiene production potentially supported by ethanol consumption as reported onproduction of betulinic acid.

Therefore, counteracting the overproduction of ROS is thebest-researched approach to preserve the functional integrity of the RPE.S-Petasin, a secondary metabolite extracted from the plant Petasites hybridus,has numerous biological effects, which highlight its anti-inflammatory andantioxidative properties. The aim of our study is to investigate whetherS-Petasin exerts cytoprotective effects by protecting the RPE from oxidativedamage. The effects of pretreatment with S-Petasin were assessed by thedetermination of the cell viability, intracellular ROS levels, activation of theNrf2 pathway and the resulting post-transcriptional antioxidant/antiapoptoticresponse. Our results show that S-Petasin pretreatment (1) reduces intracellularROS levels, improving cell viability of RPE exposed to oxidative damage; (2)activates the Nrf2 signalling pathway, modulating the post-transcriptionalresponse of its antioxidant chemical biomarkers; (3) reduces the Bax levels, andan increase in those of Bcl-2, with a concomitant downregulation of the Bax/Bc-2ratio.

The antifungal potential of EO was evaluated by radialgrowth inhibition assay (RGI). EO completely inhibited the growths of Penicilliumgriseofulvum and Aspergillus niger at a concentration of 3.125 µL/mL, which wasmarked as the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC). EO induced cellular leakagefrom fungal cells, and hyphae became pitted, indicating the strong antifungalpotential of EO. EO (2 ×MIC)-treated rice seeds showed complete inhibition of A.niger after 7 days of incubation, and in the control treatments, all the riceseeds were contaminated (100% contamination index). M-PPS and EO-based coatingscontrolled the growth of P. griseofulvum in peanut kernels.

The antimicrobial potential was tested, withformic acid having the highest mean of inhibition halos (32.09 ± 1.01 mm) andclove EO having an average of 14.36 ± 0.54 mm. The synergy between formic acidand clove was observed against Salmonella Typhimurium (∑FIC 0.37), SalmonellaEnteritidis (∑FIC 0.07), and Escherichia coli APEC (∑FIC 0.265). Through the insilico method, the potential of EO and OA to bind the proteins d-glutamate ligase(PDB ID: 1E0D) and DNA gyrase B (PDB ID: 4PRV) was evaluated. It was confirmedthat the molecules with the highest binding affinity were formic acid and clove.The antioxidant power was evaluated by the DPPH free radical capture method, andthe clove EO showed higher activity (IC(50): 3.029 μg mL(-1)). The resultsdemonstrate that the products have antimicrobial and antioxidant properties,suggesting applicability in synergistic formulations, which may be effective fora wide variety of pathogens in poultry. The association between two naturalmolecules can be possible substitutes for growth promoters, with applications infeed formulations.","Fernandes, Beatriz Pasqualli, Girardini, Lilian Kolling, Prestes, Alan M, Kominkiewicz, Marcelo, Maciel, Julcimar Machado, da Costa, Mateus Matiuzzi, Tavares, Marcio Rennan Santos, da Motta, Amanda de Souza",2025,ACS omega,2

TA034331,10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c08755,Multiliter-Scale Photosensitized Dimerization of Isoprene to Sustainable AviationFuel Precursors.,"Synthetic routes to sustainable aviation fuels are needed to mitigate theenvironmental impacts of the aviation sector. Among several emerging methods, theuse of light-driven reactions benefits from milder conditions and the possibilityof using sunlight to directly irradiate reactants or, alternatively, to powerLEDs with a high and constant light intensity. Dinaphthylketone-photosensitizeddimerization of isoprene can afford C(10) cycloalkenes that, after hydrogenation,meet the required properties for jet fuels (strongly resembling Jet-A). Isoprenecan be photobiologically produced by metabolically engineered cyanobacteria fromthe conversion of CO(2) and water by utilizing solar light, contributing to acarbon-neutral process. The scale-up of such a combinedphotobiological-photochemical route is essential to bring it closer to thecommercial level. Herein, we present the optimization and scale-up of thephotosensitized dimerization of isoprene. By designing different reactor setups,flow versus no-flow conditions, and LED lamps (λ(max) = 365 nm) versus sunlightas the light source, we reached a 2.6 L scale able to produce 61 mL of isoprenedimers per hour, which represents a 14-fold higher productivity compared to ourprevious results at a smaller scale. We also demonstrated a continuous feedprocess that converted isoprene into dimers with a 95% yield under LEDirradiation. These advancements highlight the potential of light-driven processesto contribute to the energy transition and production of sustainable aviationfuels, making them more viable for commercial use and significantly reducing theenvironmental impact of the aviation sector.","Cid Gomes, Leandro, Vajravel, Sindhujaa, Siljebo, William, Rana, Anup, Gustafsson, Tomas, Bairaktari, Asimina, Thomsen, Marianne, Ottosson, Henrik",2025,ACS sustainable chemistry & engineering,2
TA034370,10.3390/ijms26051860,Predictions of the Biological Effects of the Main Components of TarragonEssential Oil.,"Artemisia dracunculus/(tarragon) is a perennial plant used in traditionalmedicine and the food industry. The plant is known to have beneficial effects onhealth, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiseptic, carminative,anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, anthelmintic, etc. In this study, the compoundspresent in the highest concentrations in the essential oils obtained by differentextraction methods from tarragon found on the Romanian market were identified bygas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The biological activity of these compoundswas predicted using the computational tools ADMETlab3.0, admetSAR3.0,CLC-Pred2.0, and AntiBac-Pred. Also, the main molecular target of these compoundswas predicted and the interactions with this protein were evaluated usingmolecular docking. The compounds identified in high concentrations in theobtained essential oils are estragole, cis-β-ocimene, trans-β-ocimene, limonene,eugenol methyl ether, eugenol acetate, eugenol, caryophyllene oxide, andα-pinene. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicityprofiles of these compounds show that they are generally safe, but some of themcan cause skin sensitization and respiratory toxicity and are potentialinhibitors of the organic anion transporters OATP1 and OATP2. Several of thesecompounds exert antibacterial activity against some species of Staphylococcus,Streptococcus, and Prevotella. All compounds reveal potential cytotoxicity forseveral types of cancer cells. These findings may guide further experimentalstudies to identify medical and pharmacological applications of tarragon extractsor specific compounds that can be isolated from these extracts.","Pujicic, Andrijana, Popescu, Iuliana, Dascalu, Daniela, Petreuș, David Emanuel, Isvoran, Adriana",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,2

Parijoto fruit (Medinilla speciosa) is a plantthat can potentially have immunomodulatory activity because it contains flavonoidand terpenoid compounds. The aim of this research is to ascertain the totalflavonoid and phytochemical content of the parijoto fruit fraction, as well asits potential in vitro immunomodulatory activity. The extraction of powderedparijoto fruit was conducted using 70% ethanol, followed by the separation inton-hexane, ethyl acetate, and water fraction. The phytochemical content wasanalyzed with gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry. The total flavonoidcontents were determined by colorimetric analysis. In addition, theimmunomodulatory activity assay was conducted in vitro to evaluate the phagocyticactivity (phagocytic capacity [PC] and phagocytic index) of macrophages and theproliferation of lymphocytes (stimulation index [SI]). The GC results showed thatparijoto fruit extract contains 9,12-Octadecadienoic acid-, and phthalic acid.The ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the greatest total flavonoid concentrationat 7.4094 ± 0.49 mg QE/g sample. In vitro, immunomodulatory tests showed that allfractions could significantly increase macrophage phagocytic activity compared tocontrol cells. The highest value of PC and phagocytic index was found in then-hexane phase with a concentration of 750 g/mL of 82.75 ± 0.87 and aconcentration of 500 g/mL of 6.62 ± 0.19, respectively. The ethyl acetatefraction exhibited the most significant SI for lymphocyte proliferation, recordedat a concentration of 750 g/mL with a value of 8.70 ± 1.01. The ethyl acetatefraction's SI >3 value in the lymphocyte proliferation test suggests that itexhibits lymphocyte proliferation activity. The parijoto fruit may enhance thephagocytic role of macrophages and promote lymphocyte proliferation, indicatingits potential as an immunomodulatory therapy.","Winanta, Aji, Bagir, Haidar, Febriansah, Rifki, Nugraha, Arde Toga",2025,Journal of advanced pharmaceutical technology & research,2

To investigatethe mechanism of this plant-animal interaction, ripe and unripe fruits of Pipergaudichaudianum were collected in the morning, afternoon, and night. The volatileorganic compounds (VOC) were obtained through dynamic headspace (HS) andhydrodistillation (HD) and were analyzed by gas chromatography with flameionization detector and GC-MS, resulting in the identification of ninety-fivecompounds. The principal component analysis of all samples revealed a distinctionbetween the VOC obtained by the two techniques as well as differentiated thedegree of ripeness of the fruits. The VOC compositions of fruits collected atnight by HS and HD showed differences concerning those gathered in the morningand afternoon. The presence of linalool exclusively in the composition of ripefruits collected at night and the highest levels of aromadendrene and(E)-nerolidol were also found in these samples, suggesting that these compoundsmay be responsible for attracting the bats and/or indicating the degree of fruitripening. The chemical interaction between VOCs and bats appears to be morecomplex than simply considering the main compounds, encouraging additional teststo investigate the main compounds and their possible synergistic interactions.","Teixeira, Sirlei D, Santos, Thalita G, Hendges, Ana Paula P K, Mikich, Sandra B, Bianconi, Gledson V, Marques, Francisco A, Sales Maia, Beatriz Helena L N",2025,ACS omega,2

ThirtyWistar rats were divided into five groups (n = 6): Group 1: Normal (control).Group 2: APA 640 mg/kg. Group 3: alpha-pinene 50 mg/kg (APA+ αPi 50 mg/kg). Group4: alpha-pinene 100 mg/kg (APA+ αPi 100 mg/kg). Group 5: silymarin 50 mg/kg (APA+SIL). Alpha-pinene or silymarin was orally administered after APA administrationfor 14 consecutive days. This study investigated liver damage by preparingpathology slides from liver tissue. Levels of AST, ALT, ALP, total bilirubin,total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS) were measured.Inflammatory factors, including NF-kB gene expression and levels of IL-6 andTNF-a, were also measured. Administering alpha-pinene with APA can prevent liverdamage induced by APA. Alpha-pinene can enhance TAC while reducing TOS, ALT, AST,ALP, and total bilirubin. Moreover, the results have also revealed thatalpha-pinene decreases NF-kB expression, which leads to a reduction in IL-6 andTNF-a levels. It appears that alpha-pinene induces liver protective effectsagainst APA damage by reducing the activity of liver enzymes, improvingantioxidant/oxidative status, and reducing inflammation through the regulation ofNF-kB and pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Rahimi, Kaveh, Rezaie, Anahita, Allahverdi, Younes, Shahriari, Parham, Taheri Mirghaed, Mahtab",2025,Physiological reports,2

Nootkatone (NKT) is a functional sesquiterpene sourced fromtraditional Chinese medicine --Alpinia Oxyphylla Miq and has been reported tohave a diverse range of pharmacological properties. However, it remains unknownwhether there are effects of NKT on GBM. In this study, we found that NKTinhibited the growth of GBM cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.Subsequently, we observed that NKT suppressed the migration and arrested cellcycle at G2/M phase of GBM cells. Furthermore, NKT induced the death of GBM cellsaccompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.Mechanistically, we found that NKT inhibited the progression of GBM cells throughactivating the ATF4-CHOP-CHAC1 pathway in GBM cells. Furthermore, NKT-inducedinhibition of migration and proliferation in GBM cells was partially restored byATF4 or CHAC1 knockdown. Finally, we found that NKT inhibited the growth of tumorin GBM orthotopic mice model through activation of ATF4-CHOP-CHAC1 axis. Takentogether, our findings show that NKT suppresses the growth and migration of GBMcells by activating the ATF4-CHOP-CHAC1 pathway, which in turn prevents thetumorigenesis of GBMs and provides a novel perspective for the development ofdrugs against GBM.","Wang, Qian, Xue, Xiumin, Chen, Zhichao, Zhang, Wei, Qian, Yiming, Chen, Danni, Lin, Lin, Yuan, Yinfeng, Zhao, Weiqiao, Huang, Zhihui, Wang, Yongjie",2025,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",2
TA034748,10.1002/tpg2.20560,Combining genome-wide association and genomic prediction to unravel the geneticarchitecture of carotenoid accumulation in carrot.,"Carrots (Daucus carota L.) are a rich source of provitamin A, namely, α- andβ-carotene. Breeding programs prioritize increasing β-carotene content forimproved color and nutrition. Understanding the genetic basis of carotenoidaccumulation is crucial for implementing genomic-assisted selection to develophigh-carotenoid lines. While previous studies identified loci (Y2, Y, Or, andREC) associated with carrot color and carotenoid content, this study employedgenome-wide association (GWA) in a diverse panel of 738 carrot accessions. Wediscovered a novel locus with a candidate gene encoding phytoene synthase, a keyenzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis. The Y2, Y, Or, and REC loci are mostly fixedin orange varieties, yet considerable variation in carotenoid concentrationpersists. This suggests a multigenic trait influenced by the environment. GWA ofcarotenoid concentration identified a quantitative trait locus for totalcarotenoids and α-carotene. We explored the accuracy of genomic prediction (GP)models to predict carotenoid concentration. We determined the optimal number ofplants and plots required for accurate carotenoid phenotyping, finding ≥5 plantsper plot and three plots per site as the minimum effective sample per accession.GP models achieved accuracies ranging from 0.06 to 0.40 depending on thecarotenoid measured and environment the carrots were assayed. Additional studiesin breeding programs will clarify the potential of genomic-assisted selection forhigh-carotenoid carrots.","Rolling, William R, Ellison, Shelby, Coe, Kevin, Iorizzo, Massimo, Dawson, Julie, Senalik, Douglas, Simon, Philipp W",2025,The plant genome,2

This studyaimed to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the ameliorative effect ofcrocin. Bovine spermatozoa were cryopreserved in a freezing medium supplementedwith 0, 0.5, or 1 mM of crocin. Sperm lysates were evaluated for their redoxstatus and the expression of proteins implicated in the heat stress response(HSR) and apoptosis. Crocin protected spermatozoa from the accumulation ofsuperoxide anion and ameliorated their post-thawing antioxidant capacity in termsof ROS scavenging activity and glutathione content. Moreover, crocin decreasedthe levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), while it increasedsuperoxide dimsutase-1 (SOD-1) levels. These effects were associated with aninhibition of apoptosis, as evidenced by a decreased Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio anddecreased levels of caspase-cleaved substrates. Finally, crocin affected the heatshock response of spermatozoa, since it upregulated the levels of heat shockproteins (Hsp) 60, 70, and 90. In conclusion, the addition of crocin to thefreezing medium ensured controlled amounts of ROS, enhanced the antioxidantcapacity of spermatozoa, and upregulated the anti-apoptotic proteins and Hsps,thus contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.","Sapanidou, Vasiliki, Tsantarliotou, Maria P, Feidantsis, Konstantinos, Tzekaki, Eleni E, Kourousekos, Georgios, Lavrentiadou, Sophia N",2025,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA034824,10.1186/s12890-025-03533-z,β-elemene inhibits tumor-promoting in small cell lung cancer by affecting M2macrophages and TGF-β.,"OBJECTIVE: M2 macrophages have been implicated in promoting tumor growth andmetastasis in various cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Thisstudy investigated the role of M2 macrophages in SCLC progression and exploredthe therapeutic potential of β-elemene, a natural compound, in modulating M2macrophage-mediated tumor promotion. METHODS: We differentiated THP-1 monocytesinto M2 macrophages using PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), IL-4(interleukin-4), and IL-13 (interleukin-13). M2 macrophages were co-cultured withthe SCLC cell line NCI-H209, and CCK-8, Transwell, and flow cytometry assays wereperformed. TGF-β expression levels were detected by ELISA. M2 macrophages andNCI-H209 co-cultured cells were treated with β-elemene, or M2 macrophages weretransfected with TGF-β shRNA lentivirus, and then co-cultured with NCI-H209cells. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell apoptosis. Immunofluorescencestaining was performed to assess TGF-β expression. RESULTS: Our findingsdemonstrate that M2 macrophages significantly enhance the viability,proliferation, and migration of SCLC cells, and this effect is associated withincreased TGF-β expression in SCLC cells co-cultured with M2 macrophages.Furthermore, β-elemene treatment significantly reduced the migration andviability of SCLC cells co-cultured with M2 macrophages. Silencing TGF-βexpression in M2 macrophages also suppressed SCLC cell proliferation andmigration, suggesting that β-elemene may inhibit the pro-tumorigenic effects ofM2 macrophages in SCLC by modulating TGF-β signaling. Immunofluorescence stainingrevealed that β-elemene treatment significantly reduced TGF-β levels in SCLCcells co-cultured with M2 macrophages, supporting the hypothesis that β-elemeneexerts its antitumor activity by modulating the TGF-β pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Ourresults suggest that β-elemene has the potential to suppress SCLC development bymodulating M2 macrophages and the TGF-β, offering a new therapeutic avenue andpotential drug candidate for SCLC treatment.","Huang, Wenhui, Fu, Bing, Xu, Haoran",2025,BMC pulmonary medicine,2
TA034842,10.3390/nu17030539,"The Chemopreventive Effect of Ginsenoside Compound K Is Regulated by PARP-1Hyperactivation, Which Is Promoted by p62-Dependent SIRT6 Degradation.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ginsenoside compound K (CK), a saponin metabolite ofginseng, exerts anticancer effects; however, its molecular mechanisms of actionin lung cancer remain unclear. We investigated the involvement of silentinformation regulator 6 (SIRT6) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inthe anticancer effects of CK in lung cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: CK inducedPARP-1 activation-mediated parthanatos via sequestosome-1/p62-mediated SIRT6degradation and inhibited the proliferation of H460 cells. Although CK reducedprocaspase-8 levels, no significant apoptotic cleavage of procaspase-3 or PARP-1was observed. Furthermore, CK upregulated p27, p21, phospho-p53, and gamma-H2AXlevels. CK increased LC3-II levels in a p62-independent manner, but p62 wasupregulated by autophagy inhibition, indicating that p62 is involved inCK-induced autophagy. CK-treated cells showed typical features of parthanatos,including PARP-1 hyperactivation, intracellular redistribution of poly ADP-riboseand pro-apoptotic factors, and chromatin fragmentation. SIRT6 was degraded in aCK concentration- and time-dependent manner. SIRT6 protein was upregulated byPARP-1 inhibition, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ supplementation,antioxidants, and p62 knockdown, but was decreased by autophagy blockade. PARP-1activation was negatively correlated with SIRT6 levels, indicating that SIRT6 andPARP-1 activation play complementary roles in CK-induced growth inhibition.Immunofluorescence staining, fractionation studies, and immunoprecipitation wereused to confirm the colocalization and interaction between p62 and SIRT6.CONCLUSIONS: PARP-1 activation is promoted by p62-mediated SIRT6 degradation,which plays an important role in CK-induced growth inhibition. Therefore, SIRT6is a potential biomarker for the chemopreventive effect of CK in lung cancercells, but further studies on SIRT6 are needed for the clinical application ofCK.","Kim, Sang-Hun, Ki, Sung-Hwan, Hyeong, Seok-Woo, Oh, Seon-Hee",2025,Nutrients,2

The essential oils were obtained fromfresh leaves by hydrodistillation, using a modified Clevenger apparatus. Chemicalanalysis by gas-liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showedthat these essential oils are rich in monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons.Activity against the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli , Listeriamonocytogenes , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella choleraesuis andStaphylococcus aureus was evaluated with the agar cavity diffusion method, whileactivity on the filamentous fungi Aspergillus flavus , Aspergillus niger ,Aspergillus carbonarius and Penicillium commune was evaluated by the diskdiffusion technique. Trypanocidal activity was tested against Trypanosoma cruziepimastigotes, using the Tetrazolium salt (MTT) colorimetric assay. Bothessential oils exhibited low inhibitory effect towards bacteria, showing high MICvalues (125-500 μg mL (-1) ), with Gram positive bacteria being more susceptible.Better inhibitory effect was obtained for the evaluated fungi, with lower MICvalues (7.81-250 μg mL (-1) ), being A. flavus the most susceptible species.

In this study,farnesol dehydrogenase was extracted from Polygonum minus leaves and purified204-fold to apparent homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography usingDEAE-Toyopearl, SP-Toyopearl, and Super-Q Toyopearl, followed by three successivepurifications by gel filtration chromatography on a TSK-gel GS3000SW. The enzymeis a heterodimer comprised of subunits with molecular masses of 65 kDa and 70kDa. The optimum temperature and pH were 35°C and pH 9.5, respectively. Activitywas inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, metal-chelating agents and heavy metalions. The enzyme utilized both NAD+ and NADP+ as coenzymes with Km values of 0.74mM and 40 mM, respectively. Trans, trans-farnesol was the preferred substrate forthe P. minus farnesol dehydrogenase. Geometrical isomers of trans,trans-farnesol, cis, trans-farnesol and cis, cis-farnesol were also oxidized bythe enzyme with lower activity. The Km values for trans, trans-farnesol, cis,trans-farnesol and cis, cis-farnesol appeared to be 0.17 mM, 0.33 mM and 0.42 mM,respectively. The amino acid sequences of 4 tryptic peptides of the enzyme wereanalyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS spectrometry, and showed no significant similarityto those of previously reported farnesol dehydrogenases. These results suggestthat the purified enzyme is a novel NAD(P)+-dependent farnesol dehydrogenase. Thepurification and characterization established in the current study will serve asa basis to provide new information for recombinant production of the enzyme.Therefore, recombinant farnesol dehydrogenase may provide a useful molecular toolin manipulating juvenile hormone biosynthesis to generate transgenic plants forpest control.","Ahmad-Sohdi, Nor-Ain-Shahajar, Seman-Kamarulzaman, Ahmad-Faris, Mohamed-Hussein, Zeti-Azura, Hassan, Maizom",2015,PloS one,2

High-titer microbialsynthesis of limonene and α-bisabolene could pave the way for advances in in vivoengineering of tailor-made hydrocarbons, and production at commercial scale. Wehave engineered the fast-growing unicellular euryhaline cyanobacteriumSynechococcus sp. PCC 7002 to produce yields of 4 mg L(-1) limonene and0.6 mg L(-1) α-bisabolene through heterologous expression of the Menthaspicatal-limonene synthase or the Abies grandis (E)-α-bisabolene synthase genes,respectively. Titers were significantly higher when a dodecane overlay wasapplied during culturing, suggesting either that dodecane traps large quantitiesof volatile limonene or α-bisabolene that would otherwise be lost to evaporation,and/or that continuous product removal in dodecane alleviates product feedbackinhibition to promote higher rates of synthesis. We also investigate limonene andbisabolene production in the ΔglgC genetic background, where carbon partitioningis redirected at the expense of glycogen biosynthesis. The Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 ΔglgC mutant excreted a suite of overflow metabolites (α-ketoisocaproate,pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, and acetate) during nitrogen-deprivation,and also at the onset of stationary growth in nutrient-replete media. None of theexcreted metabolites, however, appeared to be effectively utilized for terpenoidmetabolism. Interestingly, we observed a 1.6- to 2.5-fold increase in theextracellular concentration of most excreted organic acids when the ΔglgC mutantwas conferred with the ability to produce limonene. Overall, Synechococcus sp.PCC 7002 provides a highly promising platform for terpenoid biosynthetic andmetabolic engineering efforts.","Davies, Fiona K, Work, Victoria H, Beliaev, Alexander S, Posewitz, Matthew C",2014,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2
TA035058,10.1371/journal.pone.0133886,Pluronics-Formulated Farnesol Promotes Efficient Killing and Demonstrates NovelInteractions with Streptococcus mutans Biofilms.,"Streptococcus mutans is the primary causative agent of dental caries, one of themost prevalent diseases in the United States. Previously published studies haveshown that Pluronic-based tooth-binding micelles carrying hydrophobicantimicrobials are extremely effective at inhibiting S. mutans biofilm growth onhydroxyapatite (HA). Interestingly, these studies also demonstrated thatnon-binding micelles (NBM) carrying antimicrobial also had an inhibitory effect,leading to the hypothesis that the Pluronic micelles themselves may interact withthe biofilm. To explore this potential interaction, three different S. mutansstrains were each grown as biofilm in tissue culture plates, either untreated orsupplemented with NBM alone (P85), NBM containing farnesol (P85F), or farnesolalone (F). In each tested S. mutans strain, biomass was significantly decreased(SNK test, p < 0.05) in the P85F and F biofilms relative to untreated biofilms.Furthermore, the P85F biofilms formed large towers containing dead cells thatwere not observed in the other treatment conditions. Tower formation appeared tobe specific to formulated farnesol, as this phenomenon was not observed in S.mutans biofilms grown with NBM containing triclosan. Parallel CFU/mldeterminations revealed that biofilm growth in the presence of P85F resulted in a3-log reduction in viability, whereas F decreased viability by less than 1-log.Wild-type biofilms grown in the absence of sucrose or gtfBC mutant biofilms grownin the presence of sucrose did not form towers. However, increased cell killingwith P85F was still observed, suggesting that cell killing is independent oftower formation. Finally, repeated treatment of pre-formed biofilms with P85F wasable to elicit a 2-log reduction in viability, whereas parallel treatment with Falone only reduced viability by 0.5-log. Collectively, these results suggest thatPluronics-formulated farnesol induces alterations in biofilm architecture,presumably via interaction with the sucrose-dependent biofilm matrix, and may bea viable treatment option in the prevention and treatment of pathogenic plaquebiofilms.","Mogen, Austin B, Chen, Fu, Ahn, Sang-Joon, Burne, Robert A, Wang, Dong, Rice, Kelly C",2015,PloS one,2
TA035118,10.1111/nph.14191,Defense traits in the long-lived Great Basin bristlecone pine and resistance tothe native herbivore mountain pine beetle.,"Mountain pine beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) is a significant mortalityagent of Pinus, and climate-driven range expansion is occurring. Pinus defensesin recently invaded areas, including high elevations, are predicted to be lowerthan in areas with longer term MPB presence. MPB was recently observed inhigh-elevation forests of the Great Basin (GB) region, North America. Defense andsusceptibility in two long-lived species, GB bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva)and foxtail pine (P. balfouriana), are unclear, although they are sympatric witha common MPB host, limber pine (P. flexilis). We surveyed stands with sympatricGB bristlecone-limber pine and foxtail-limber pine to determine relative MPBattack susceptibility and constitutive defenses. MPB-caused mortality wasextensive in limber, low in foxtail and absent in GB bristlecone pine. Defensetraits, including constitutive monoterpenes, resin ducts and wood density, werehigher in GB bristlecone and foxtail than in limber pine. GB bristlecone andfoxtail pines have relatively high levels of constitutive defenses which makethem less vulnerable to climate-driven MPB range expansion relative to otherhigh-elevation pines. Long-term selective herbivore pressure and exaptation oftraits for tree longevity are potential explanations, highlighting the complexityof predicting plant-insect interactions under climate change.","Bentz, Barbara J, Hood, Sharon M, Hansen, E Matthew, Vandygriff, James C, Mock, Karen E",2017,The New phytologist,2
TA035157,10.5114/aoms.2014.45442,Meroxest improves the prognosis of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice with allograftsof E0771 mouse breast tumor cells.,"INTRODUCTION: Recently, we have reported the antitumor properties of a new familyof synthetic merosesquiterpenes, among which meroxest is highlighted, since ithas high activity and specificity for ER(+) breast cancer cells. In this paper,we characterize allografts of ER(+) E0771 mouse breast tumor cells inimmunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, and also analyze the effect of meroxest on theprognosis of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty female C57BL/6 mice wereinjected with 10(6) E0771 cells. Once the tumors reached the appropriate size,the mice were divided into two groups, one control and another treated orallywith 15 mg/kg of meroxest. After 20 days, tumor samples were taken forhistopathological study and for determination of the expression of the prognosticmarkers Ki67 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunofluorescence.RESULTS: In sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, we observed that tumors havea well-defined capsule enclosing E0771 tumor cells. The central area of tumorscontains necrotic regions with leukocyte infiltration. Meroxest treatmentsignificantly reduces tumor size (68%, p < 0.05), induces changes in itsstructure, decreases the degree of leukocyte infiltration, and significantlyreduces the expression of Ki67 (33%, p < 0.05) and VEGF (82%, p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Meroxest improves the prognosis of mice since it reduces leukocyteinfiltration, and decreases the expression of Ki67 and VEGF markers.Consequently, the merosesquiterpene could become a useful antiangiogenic drug inthe treatment of breast cancer. These results encourage us to deepen the study ofmeroxest, in order to find more evidence that supports the convenience of itsevaluation in a clinical study or trial.","Carrasco, Esther, Garrido, Jose Manuel, Álvarez, Pablo Juan, Álvarez-Manzaneda, Enrique, Chahboun, Rachid, Messouri, Ibtissam, Melguizo, Consolación, Aránega, Antonia, Rodríguez-Serrano, Fernando",2016,Archives of medical science : AMS,2

Differences in growth and expressed proteins were detected betweenthe BMB strain and the CCAP strain, and the BMB strain reached the highest celldensities under the given growth conditions. Fatty acid (FA) analyses showedhighest relative eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels in the exponential phase(25.73% and 28.31%), and highest levels of palmitoleic acid (16:1 n-7) in thestationary phase (46.36% and 43.66%) in the BMB and CCAP strain, respectively.The most striking finding of the VOCs analyses was the relatively high levels ofectocarpene, 6-((1E)-butenyl)-1,4-cycloheptadiene, hormosirene, and desmaresteneand structurally related compounds, which were exclusively detected in the BMBstrain. Many of the VOCs detected in the CCAP and, in particular, in the BMBstrain have been reported as antimicrobial agents. We suggest that the array ofpheromones and antimicrobial substances could be part of an allelopathic strategyof the BMB strain, dominated by oval cells, thus reflecting the benthic lifestage of this morphological form. These findings show the potential for bioactivemetabolites in the BMB strain.","Prestegard, Siv Kristin, Erga, Svein Rune, Steinrücken, Pia, Mjøs, Svein Are, Knutsen, Gjert, Rohloff, Jens",2015,Marine drugs,2
TA035168,10.1016/j.jgr.2014.04.004,Investigation of ginsenosides in different tissues after elicitor treatment inPanax ginseng.,"BACKGROUND: The effect of methyl jasmonate (MJ) on ginsenoside production indifferent organs of ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) was evaluated after the wholeplant was dipped in an MJ-containing solution. MJ can induce the production ofantioxidant defense genes and secondary metabolites in plants. In ginseng, MJtreatment in adventitious root resulted in the increase of dammarenediol synthaseexpression but a decrease of cycloartenol synthase expression, thereby enhancingginsenoside biosynthesis. Although a previous study focused on the application ofMJ to affect ginsenoside production in adventitious roots, we conducted ourresearch on entire plants by evaluating the effect of exogenous MJ on ginsenosideproduction with the aim of obtaining new approaches to study ginsenosidebiosynthesis response to MJ in vivo. METHODS: Different parts of MJ-treatedginseng plants were analyzed for ginsenoside contents (fine root, root body,epidermis, rhizome, stem, and leaf) by high-performance liquid chromatography.RESULTS: The total ginsenoside content of the ginseng root significantlyincreased after 2 d of MJ treatment compared with the control not subjected toMJ. Our results revealed that MJ treatment enhances ginsenoside production not inthe epidermis but in the stele of the ginseng root, implying transportation ofginsenosides from the root vasculature to the epidermis. Application of MJenhanced protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenosides, whereas chilling treatmentinduced protopanaxatriol (PPT)-type ginsenosides. CONCLUSION: These findingsindicate that the production of PPD-type and PPT-type ginsenosides is differentlyaffected by abiotic and biotic stresses in the ginseng plant, and they might playdifferent defense mechanism roles.","Oh, Ji Yeon, Kim, Yu-Jin, Jang, Moon-Gi, Joo, Sung Chul, Kwon, Woo-Saeng, Kim, Se-Yeong, Jung, Seok-Kyu, Yang, Deok-Chun",2014,Journal of ginseng research,2

Monoterpenes are a major part of plant essential oils foundlargely in fruits, vegetables and herbs. The cellular and molecular activitiesshow therapeutic progression that may reduce the risk of developing cancer bymodulating the factors responsible for colon carcinogenesis. Colon cancer wasinduced with DMH with a dose of (20 mg/Kg/body weight) for 15 weeks bysubcutaneous injection once in a week. Myrtenal treatment was started with (230mg/Kg/body weight) by intragastric administration, one week prior to DMHinduction and continued till the experimental period of 30 weeks. The Invivoresults exhibit the elevated antioxidant and lipid peroxidation levels in DMHtreated animals. The Histopathological analysis of colon tissues well supportedthe biochemical alterations and inevitably proves the protective role ofMyrtenal. Treatment with myrtenal to cancer bearing animals resulted in aremarkable increase in the inherent antioxidants and excellent modulation in themorphological and physiological nature of the colon tissue. It is thus concludedthat myrtenal exhibits excellent free radical scavenging activity and anticanceractivity through the suppression of colon carcinoma in Wistar albino rats.","Lokeshkumar, Booupathy, Sathishkumar, Venkatachalam, Nandakumar, Natarajan, Rengarajan, Thamaraiselvan, Madankumar, Arumugam, Balasubramanian, Maruthaiveeran Periyasamy",2015,Biomolecules & therapeutics,2

However, the further clinicaldevelopment of BA got hampered because of poor solubility and pharmacologicalproperties. Interestingly, this molecule offer several hotspots for structuralmodifications in order to address its associated issues. In our endeavor, weselected C-3 position for the desirable chemical modification in order to improveits cytotoxic and pharmacological potential and prepared a library of differenttriazoline derivatives of BA. Among them, we previously reported theidentification of a potential molecule, that is,3{1N(5-hydroxy-naphth-1yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4yl}methyloxy betulinic acid (HBA)with significant inhibition of cancer cell growth and their properties. In thepresent study, we have shown for the first time that HBA decreased the expressionof phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) p110α and p85α and caused significantdownregulation of pAKT and of NFκB using human leukemia and breast cancer cellsas in vitro models. Further it was revealed that PI3K inhibition by HBA inducedcell cycle arrest via effects on different cell cycle regulatory proteins thatinclude CDKis cyclins and pGSK3β. Also, this target-specific inhibition wasassociated with mitochondrial apoptosis as was reflected by the increasedexpression of mitochondrial bax, downregulated bcl2 and decreased mitochondriallevels of cytochrome c, together with reactive oxygen species generation anddecline in mitochondrial membrane potential. The apoptotic effectors such ascaspase 8, caspase 9 and caspase 3 were found to be upregulated besides DNArepair-associated enzyme, that is, PARP cleavage caused cancer cell death.Pharmacodynamic evaluation revealed that both HBA and BA were safe upto the doseof 2000 mg/kg body weight and with acceptable pharmacodynamic parameters.

TA035276,10.1186/s13068-016-0503-4,Insights into isoprene production using the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.,"BACKGROUND: Cyanobacteria are phototrophic prokaryotes that convert inorganiccarbon as CO2 into organic compounds at the expense of light energy. They needonly inorganic nutrients and can be cultivated to high densities using non-arableland and seawater. This has made cyanobacteria attractive organisms for theproduction of biofuels and chemical feedstock. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is oneof the most widely used cyanobacterial model strains. Based on its availablegenome sequence and genetic tools, Synechocystis has been genetically modified toproduce different biotechnological products. Efficient isoprene production is anattractive goal because this compound is widely used as chemical feedstock.RESULTS: Here, we report on our attempts to generate isoprene-producing strainsof Synechocystis using a plasmid-based strategy. As previously reported, acodon-optimized plant isoprene synthase (IspS) was expressed under the control ofdifferent Synechocystis promoters that ensure strong constitutive orlight-regulated ispS expression. The expression of the ispS gene was quantifiedby qPCR and Western blotting, while the amount of isoprene was quantified usingGC-MS. In addition to isoprene measurements in the headspace of closed culturevessels, single photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SPI-MS) wasapplied, which allowed online measurements of isoprene production inopen-cultivation systems under various conditions. Under standard conditions, agood correlation existed between ispS expression and isoprene production rate.The cultivation of isoprene production strains under NaCl-supplemented conditionsdecreased isoprene production despite enhanced ispS mRNA levels. Thecharacterization of the metabolome of isoprene-producing strains indicated thatisoprene production might be limited by insufficient precursor levels.Transcriptomic analysis revealed the upregulation of mRNA and regulatory RNAscharacteristic of acclimation to metabolic stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our bestproduction strains produced twofold higher isoprene amounts in the presence oflow NaCl concentrations than previously reported strains. These results willguide future attempts to establish isoprene production in cyanobacterial hosts.","Pade, Nadin, Erdmann, Sabrina, Enke, Heike, Dethloff, Frederik, Dühring, Ulf, Georg, Jens, Wambutt, Juliane, Kopka, Joachim, Hess, Wolfgang R, Zimmermann, Ralf, Kramer, Dan, Hagemann, Martin",2016,Biotechnology for biofuels,2

Celastrol is a quinonemethide triterpene and the most abundant bioactive constituent isolated from theroot extracts of T. wilfordii. Previous studies have shown that celastrolexhibits antiviral activity against HIV and SARS-CoV. To date, no investigationsof the anti-DENV activity of celastrol have been reported. This work aimed toinvestigate the anti-DENV effect and possible mechanism of celastrol in vitro andin vivo. METHODS: A four-serotype DENV infection system was performed todetermine the anti-DENV effect of celastrol by detecting DENV RNA replication andprotein synthesis. The precise anti-DENV replication mechanism of celastrol wasclarified using specific RNA silencing and specific inhibitor. In addition, thetherapeutic efficacy of celastrol was evaluated by monitoring survival rates andclinical scores in a DENV-infected Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) sucklingmouse model. RESULTS: Celastrol inhibited DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 RNA replicationwith EC(50) values of 0.19 ± 0.09, 0.12 ± 0.11, 0.16 ± 0.14, and 0.17 ± 0.08 μM,respectively. This antiviral effect of celastrol was associated withcelastrol-induced interferon-α (IFN-α) expression and was attenuated by aspecific inhibitor of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway downstream of IFN-α orspecific shRNA. Furthermore, celastrol protected ICR suckling mice againstlife-threatening DENV infection. CONCLUSION: Celastrol represents a potentialanti-DENV agent that induces IFN-α expression and stimulates a downstreamantiviral response, making the therapy a promising drug or dietary supplement forthe treatment of DENV-infected patients.","Yu, Jung-Sheng, Tseng, Chin-Kai, Lin, Chun-Kuang, Hsu, Yao-Chin, Wu, Yu-Hsuan, Hsieh, Ching-Liang, Lee, Jin-Ching",2017,Antiviral research,2

The natural products, either as pure compounds or as standardizedplant extracts, have been a successful source of inspiration for the developmentof new drugs. The present work was carried out to investigate the cytotoxicity,antiviral and antimycobacterial activity of the methanol extract and of fouridentified limonoids from the fruits of Melia azedarach (Meliaceae). The extractand purified limonoids were tested in cell-based assays for antiviral activityagainst representatives of ssRNA, dsRNA and dsDNA viruses and againstMycobacterium tuberculosis. Very interestingly, 3-α-tigloyl-melianol andmelianone showed a potent antiviral activity (EC50 in the range of 3-11μM)against three important human pathogens, belonging to Flaviviridae family, WestNile virus, Dengue virus and Yellow Fever virus. Mode of action studiesdemonstrated that title compounds were inhibitors of West Nile virus only whenadded during the infection, acting as inhibitors of the entry or of a very earlyevent of life cycle. Furthermore, 3-α-tigloyl-melianol and methyl kulonate showedinteresting antimycobacterial activity (with MIC values of 29 and 70 μMrespectively). The limonoids are typically lipophilic compounds present in thefruits of Melia azeradach. They are known as cytotoxic compounds againstdifferent cancer cell lines, while their potential as antiviral and antibacterialwas poorly investigated.

Proinflammatory condition was induced using either phorbolester acetate (PMA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). InTHP1 cells, short term pretreatment (2 h) with a low concentration (2 μM) oflycopene reinforce proinflammatory gene expression. The extent of the effect oflycopene is dependent on the proinflammtory stimulus (PMA, LPS or TNF) used.Lycopene enhanced MMP9 secretion via a c-AMP-dependent process, and reduced ROSproduction at higher concentrations than 2 μM. Cell culture media, conditioned byPMA-treated monocytes and then transferred on CaCo-2 epithelial cells, induced aproinflammatory state in these cells. The extent of this inflammatory effect wasreduced when cells has been pretreated (12 h) with lycopene. At low concentration(2 μM or less), lycopene appeared to promote an inflammatory state not correlatedwith ROS modulation. At higher concentration (5 μM-20 μM), an anti-inflammatoryeffect takes place as a decrease of ROS production was detected. So, bothconcentration and time have to be considered in order to define the exact issueof the effect of carotenoids present in meals.","Makon-Sébastien, Njock, Francis, Fouchier, Eric, Seree, Henri, Villard Pierre, François, Landrier Jean, Laurent, Pechere, Yves, Barra, Serge, Champion",2014,Mediators of inflammation,2

However, ATRA treatmentalso increases cytokine, chemokine, and adhesive molecule (mainly ICAM-1)expression, which can cause clinical complications, including a severe situationknown as differentiation syndrome (DS) which can cause death. Therefore, it is ofclinical significance to find a strategy to specifically blunt inflammatoryeffects while preserving differentiation. Here we report that the naturalcompound, celastrol, could effectively block lung infiltrations in DS animalmodels created by loading ATRA-induced APL cell line NB4. In ATRA-treated NB4cells, celastrol could potently inhibit ICAM-1 elevation and partially reduceTNF-α and IL-1β secretion, though treatment showed no effects on IL-8 and MCP-1levels. Celastrol's effect on ICAM-1 in ATRA-treated NB4 was related to reducingMEK1/ERK1 activation. Strikingly and encouragingly, celastrol showed no obviouseffects on ATRA-induced NB4 differentiation, as determined by morphology,enzymes, and surface markers. Our results show that celastrol is a promising andunique agent for managing the side effects of ATRA application on APL, andsuggest that hyper-inflammatory ability is accompanied by, but not necessary for,APL differentiation. Thus we offered an encouraging novel strategy to furtherimprove differentiation therapy.","Xu, Li-min, Zheng, Yue-juan, Wang, Ying, Yang, Yang, Cao, Fan-fan, Peng, Bin, Xu, Xiong-fei, An, Hua-zhang, Zheng, Ao-xiang, Zhang, Deng-hai, Uzan, Georges, Yu, Yi-zhi",2014,PloS one,2

Yet, effective interventions to preventthis conversion are unavailable for clinical practice. In this study, we examinedthe beneficial effects of Tanshinone IIA on renal fibrosis in a mouse model offolic acid induced AKI. We found that Tanshinone IIA treatment significantlyattenuated the folic acid elicited kidney dysfunction on days 3, 14, and 28. Thiseffect was concomitant with a much lessened accumulation of fibronectin andcollagen in tubulointerstitium 28 days after folic acid injury, denoting anameliorated renal fibrosis. The kidney protective and antifibrotic effect ofTanshinone IIA was likely attributable to an early inhibition of renalrecruitment of fibrocytes positive for both CD45 and collagen I. Mechanistically,Tanshinone IIA treatment not only markedly diminished renal expression ofchemoattractants for fibrocytes such as TGFβ1 and MCP-1, but also significantlyreduced circulating fibrocytes at the acute phase of kidney injury. These datasuggested that Tanshinone IIA might be a novel therapy for preventing progressionof CKD after AKI.","Jiang, Chunming, Shao, Qiuyuan, Jin, Bo, Gong, Rujun, Zhang, Miao, Xu, Biao",2015,BioMed research international,2

Asiatic acid is a naturalphytochemical with oxidant, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties whoseeffect on malarial and accompanying pathophysiology are yet to be investigated.Asiatic acid influence in P. berghei-infected Sprague Dawley rats on%parasitaemia and malarial anaemia were investigated. METHODS: Plasmodiumberghei-infected rats (90-120 g) were orally administered with Asiatic acid (5,10, 20 mg/kg) and 30 mg/kg chloroquine as a positive control. Changes in%parasitaemia and haematological parameters in Asiatic acid administered ratswere monitored in a 21 day study and compared to controls. RESULTS: All animalsdeveloped stable parasitaemia (15-20 %) by day 7. Asiatic acid doses suppressedparasitaemia, normalised haematological measurements and influenced biophysicalcharacteristics changes. Most positive changes were associated with intragastricadministration of 10 mg/kg Asiatic acid dose. Peak %parasitaemia in Asiatic acidadministration occurred at days 12 with a shorter time course compared to day 9for chloroquine (30 mg/kg) treatment with a longer time course. CONCLUSIONS: OralAsiatic acid administration influenced %parasitaemia suppression, amelioratedmalarial anaemia and increased biophysical properties on infected animals.Asiatic acid may be a replacement alternative for chloroquine treatment withconcomitant amelioration of malaria pathophysiology.

KHF16 reduces the expression levels ofXIAP, Mcl-1, Survivin and Cyclin B1/D1 proteins. Importantly, KHF16 inhibitsTNFα-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation, IKBα phosphorylation, p65 nucleartranslocation and NF-κB downstream target gene expression, including XIAP, Mcl-1and Survivin, in TNBC cells.

However, the anticancer activity and mechanisms of PM in prostatecancer cells have not been adequately investigated. Here we report that thedegradation of survivin plays an important role in the antiproliferative andproapoptotic effects of PM in carcinoma of the prostate (CaP) cell lines.Treatment with PM inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in LNCaP and PC-3cells as characterized by the loss of cell viability and an increase in AnnexinV-binding and cleavage of PARP-1, respectively. The antiproliferative andapoptosis-inducing effects of PM were associated with the inhibition of cellcycle regulatory proteins, antiapoptotic survivin and members of the Bcl-2family. Data showed that response to PM is regulated by survivin sinceoverexpression of survivin rendered CaP cells resistant to PM. Furthermore,downregulation of survivin by PM was mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasomaldegradation. Together, these data demonstrate that pristimerin inhibitsproliferation and induces apoptosis in CaP cells by abolishing survivin throughthe ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.","Liu, Yong Bo, Gao, Xiaohua, Deeb, Dorrah, Brigolin, Chris, Zhang, Yiguan, Shaw, Jiajiu, Pindolia, Kirit, Gautam, Subhash C",2014,International journal of oncology,2

Saffron is the site for synthesis and accumulationof apocarotenoids like crocin, picrocrin and safranal which are responsible forits color, flavour and aroma making it world's most expensive spice. Thesecompounds are formed by oxidative cleavage of zeaxanthin by carotenoid cleavagedioxygenases. Although the biosynthetic pathway of apocarotenoids is known to aconsiderable extent, the mechanism that regulates its tissue and developmentalstage specific expression is not known. RESULTS: In the present work, weidentified, cloned and characterized ultrapetala transcription factor calledCsULT1 from Crocus. The gene contains an 80 amino acid long conserved SANDdomain. The CsULT1 transcript was more abundant in stigma and showed increase inexpression from pre anthesis stage till anthesis and decreased in post anthesisstage which corroborated with the accumulation pattern of crocin indicating itspossible role in regulation of apocarotenoid biosynthesis. CsULT1 was found to betranscriptionally active and localized in nucleus. Its expression is induced inresponse to phytohormones like auxin, methyljasmonate and salicylic acid.Overexpression of CsULT1 in Crocus calli resulted in enhanced expression of keypathway genes like phytoene synthase (PSY), phytoene desaturase (PDS), betacarotene hydroxylase (BCH) and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) indicatingits role in regulation of apocarotenoid biosynthesis. CONCLUSION: This workpresents first report on isolation and characterization of ultrapetala gene fromCrocus. Our results suggest that CsULT1 is a novel regulator of Crocusapocarotenoid biosynthesis.

AIMs bind to KEAP1 and inhibit its ability topromote NRF2 degradation. As a result, NRF2 increases transcription of genes thatrestore redox balance and reduce inflammation. AIMs inhibit tumor growth andmetastasis by increasing NRF2 activity in the tumor microenvironment and bymodulating the activity of oncogenic signaling pathways, including NF-κB, intumor cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that KEAP1 loss or mutation--whichresults in high levels of sustained NRF2 activity--may promote cancer growth andincrease chemoresistance. Loss of KEAP1 also increases the levels of otheroncogenic proteins, including IKKβ and BCL2. The apparent survival advantageprovided to some tumor cells by loss of functional KEAP1 raises the question ofwhether pharmacological inhibition of KEAP1 could promote tumor growth. Toaddress this issue, we characterized the basal levels of KEAP1 and NRF2 in apanel of human tumor cell lines and profiled the activity of an AIM, RTA 405. Wefound that in tumor cell lines with low or mutant KEAP1, and in Keap1-/- murineembryonic fibroblasts, multiple KEAP1 targets including NRF2, IKKβ, and BCL2 wereelevated. Keap1-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts also had higher rates ofproliferation and colony formation than their wild-type counterparts. In cellswith functional KEAP1, RTA 405 increased NRF2 levels, but not IKKβ or BCL2levels, and did not increase cell proliferation or survival. Moreover, RTA 405inhibited growth at similar concentrations in cells with different basal NRF2activity levels and in cells with wild-type or mutant KRAS. Finally,pre-treatment with RTA 405 did not protect tumor cells from doxorubicin- orcisplatin-mediated growth inhibition. Collectively, these data demonstrate thatpharmacological activation of NRF2 by AIMs is distinct from genetic activationand does not provide a growth or survival advantage to tumor cells.","Probst, Brandon L, McCauley, Lyndsey, Trevino, Isaac, Wigley, W Christian, Ferguson, Deborah A",2015,PloS one,2

Theacceptors can be many types of nucleophiles, while the allylic diphosphates onlydiffer in the number of isoprene units and stereochemistry of the double bonds inthe hydrocarbon moieties. Because of the wide range of nucleophilicities ofnaturally occurring acceptors, the mechanism for prenyltransfer reactions may bedissociative or associative with early to late transition states. We havemeasured δ-secondary kinetic isotope effects operating through four bonds forsubstitution reactions with dimethylallyl derivatives bearing deuterated methylgroups at the distal (C3) carbon atom in the double bond under dissociative andassociative conditions.

Further high throughput analysis reveals that RAD51, a pivotalfactor in homologous recombination repair, is a potential target for it. Thefollowing mechanism studies show that (-)-Guaiol is involved in cell autophagy toregulate the expression of RAD51, leading to double-strand breaks triggered cellapoptosis. Moreover, targeting RAD51, which is highly overexpressed in the lungadenocarcinoma tissues, can significantly increase the chemosensitivity of NSCLCcells to (-)-Guaiol both in vitro and in vivo. All in all, our studies provide anattractive insight in applying (-)-Guaiol into NSCLC treatments and furthersuggest that knockdown of oncogenic RAD51 will greatly enhance thechemosensitivity of patients with NSCLC.","Yang, Qingyuan, Wu, Jianchun, Luo, Yingbin, Huang, Nan, Zhen, Ni, Zhou, Yun, Sun, Fenyong, Li, Zhi, Pan, Qiuhui, Li, Yan",2016,Oncotarget,2

F.H. Chen is one of the most highly valuedmedicinal plants in the world. The major bioactive molecules are triterpenesaponins, which are also known as ginsenosides. However, its large genome sizehas hindered the assembly of a draft genome by whole genome sequencing. Hence,genomic and transcriptomic details about P. notoginseng, especially itsbiosynthetic pathways and gene expression in different parts of the plant, haveremained largely unknown until now. RESULTS: In this study, RNA sequencing ofthree different P. notoginseng tissues was performed using next generation DNAsequencing. After assembling the high quality sequencing reads into 107,340unigenes, biochemical pathways were predicted and 9,908 unigenes were assigned to135 KEGG pathways. Among them, 270 unigenes were identified to be involved intriterpene saponin biosynthesis. In addition, 350 and 342 unigenes were predictedto encode cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, respectively, based on theannotation results, some of which encode enzymes responsible for the conversionof the triterpene saponin backbone into different ginsenosides. In particular,one unigene predominantly expressed in the root was annotated as CYP716A53v2,which probably participates in the formation of protopanaxatriol fromprotopanaxadiol in P. notoginseng. The differential expression of this gene wasfurther confirmed by real-time PCR.

In particular, steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3)has been recognized as a critical coactivator associated with tumor initiation,progression, recurrence, metastasis, and chemoresistance where it interacts withmultiple nuclear receptors and other transcription factors to enhance theirtranscriptional activities and facilitate cross-talk between pathways thatstimulate cancer progression. Because of its central role as an integrator ofgrowth signaling pathways, development of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs)against SRCs have the potential to simultaneously disrupt multiple signaltransduction networks and transcription factors involved in tumor progression.Here, high-throughput screening was performed to identify compounds able toinhibit the intrinsic transcriptional activities of the three members of the SRCfamily. Verrucarin A was identified as a SMI that can selectively promote thedegradation of the SRC-3 protein, while affecting SRC-1 and SRC-2 to a lesserextent and having no impact on CARM-1 and p300 protein levels. Verrucarin A wascytotoxic toward multiple types of cancer cells at low nanomolar concentrations,but not toward normal liver cells. Moreover, verrucarin A was able to inhibitexpression of the SRC-3 target genes MMP2 and MMP13 and attenuated cancer cellmigration. We found that verrucarin A effectively sensitized cancer cells totreatment with other anti-cancer drugs. Binding studies revealed that verrucarinA does not bind directly to SRC-3, suggesting that it inhibits SRC-3 through itsinteraction with an upstream effector. In conclusion, unlike other SRC SMIscharacterized by our laboratory that directly bind to SRCs, verrucarin A is apotent and selective SMI that blocks SRC-3 function through an indirectmechanism.","Yan, Fei, Yu, Yang, Chow, Dar-Chone, Palzkill, Timothy, Madoux, Franck, Hodder, Peter, Chase, Peter, Griffin, Patrick R, O'Malley, Bert W, Lonard, David M",2014,PloS one,2
TA036218,10.1371/journal.pone.0111346,Biologically active polymers from spontaneous carotenoid oxidation: a newfrontier in carotenoid activity.,"In animals carotenoids show biological activity unrelated to vitamin A that hasbeen considered to arise directly from the behavior of the parent compound,particularly as an antioxidant. However, the very property that confersantioxidant activity on some carotenoids in plants also confers susceptibility tooxidative transformation. As an alternative, it has been suggested thatcarotenoid oxidative breakdown or metabolic products could be the actual agentsof activity in animals. However, an important and neglected aspect of thebehavior of the highly unsaturated carotenoids is their potential to undergoaddition of oxygen to form copolymers. Recently we reported that spontaneousoxidation of ß-carotene transforms it into a product dominated byß-carotene-oxygen copolymers. We now report that the polymeric product isbiologically active. Results suggest an overall ability to prime innate immunefunction to more rapidly respond to subsequent microbial challenges. Anunderlying structural resemblance to sporopollenin, found in the outer shell ofspores and pollen, may allow the polymer to modulate innate immune responsesthrough interactions with the pattern recognition receptor system. Oxygencopolymer formation appears common to all carotenoids, is anticipated to bewidespread, and the products may contribute to the health benefits ofcarotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables.","Johnston, James B, Nickerson, James G, Daroszewski, Janusz, Mogg, Trevor J, Burton, Graham W",2014,PloS one,2
TA036235,10.2147/DDDT.S92440,Amelioration of concanavalin A-induced autoimmune hepatitis by magnesiumisoglycyrrhizinate through inhibition of CD4(+)CD25(-)CD69(+) subsetproliferation.,"Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MGL) is a new stereoisomer of glycyrrhizic acid,which is clinically used as a hepatoprotective medicine with more potent effectsand less side effects than glycyrrhizic acid. This study was designed to evaluatethe protective effects and possible mechanism of MGL against concanavalin A (ConA)-induced autoimmune hepatitis. Hepatitis was induced by Con A in C57/6J micewith or without MGL administration; injury score and serum ALT were evaluated.The CD4(+) T-cells were isolated from splenocytes and challenged with Con A aftercoculturing with MGL. The injury score was significantly improved in MGL-treatedmice after Con A challenging for 12 and 24 hours compared with those merelychallenged with Con A. Similar trends were observed in the serum levels of ALTand AST. The most interesting result was that MGL administration significantlydecreased the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(-)CD69(+) T-cells rather thanCD4(+)CD25(+)CD69(+) T-cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, after Con Achallenging 12 and 24 hours. Moreover, the serum ALT levels were markedlycorrelated with the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(-)CD69(+) cells, but only weaklycorrelated with CD4(+)CD25(+)CD69(+) cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.More importantly, MGL (5 mg/mL) almost completely eliminated the proliferation ofthe CD25(-)CD69(+) subset in primary CD4(+) T-cells after Con A challenge.Compared with merely Con A-challenged mice, those with MGL administrationsignificantly demonstrated decreased NALP3, NLRP6, and caspase-3 expression, inwhich the NALP3 and caspase-3 downregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Ourresults indicate that MGL may have potential as a therapeutic agent in autoimmunehepatitis by ameliorating liver injury. Its molecular mechanism may be involvedin inhibiting CD4(+)CD25(-)CD69(+) subset proliferation and downregulatinginflammasome expression in liver tissue.","Yang, Qi, Wang, Jianwei, Liu, Ran, Wang, Zhiqiang, Li, Yufeng, Zhang, Yifan, Hao, Xiaohua, Huang, Yubo, Xie, Wen, Wei, Hongshan",2016,"Drug design, development and therapy",2

TA036306,10.1186/s12864-015-1614-1,Genome-wide association analysis identified splicing single nucleotidepolymorphism in CFLAR predictive of triptolide chemo-sensitivity.,"BACKGROUND: Triptolide is a therapeutic diterpenoid derived from the Chinese herbTripterygium wilfordii Hook f. Triptolide has been shown to induce apoptosis byactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins, inhibiting NFkB and c-KIT pathways,suppressing the Jak2 transcription, activating MAPK8/JNK signaling and modulatingthe heat shock responses. RESULTS: In the present study, we used lymphoblast celllines (LCLs) derived from 55 unrelated Caucasian subjects to identify geneticmarkers predictive of cellular sensitivity to triptolide using genome wideassociation study. Our results identified SNPs on chromosome 2 associated withtriptolide IC50 (p < 0.0001). This region included biologically interesting genesas CFLAR, PPIl3, Caspase 8/10, NFkB and STAT6. Identification of a splicing-SNPrs10190751, which regulates CFLAR alternatively spliced isoforms predictive ofthe triptolide cytotoxicity suggests its role in triptolides action. Our resultsfrom functional studies in Panc-1 cell lines further demonstrate potential roleof CFLAR in triptolide toxicity. Analysis of gene-expression with cytotoxicityidentified JAK1 expression to be a significant predictor of triptolidesensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall out results identified genetic factorsassociated with triptolide chemo-sensitivity thereby opening up opportunities tobetter understand its mechanism of action as well as utilize these biomarkers topredict therapeutic response in patients.","Chauhan, Lata, Jenkins, Gregory D, Bhise, Neha, Feldberg, Tanya, Mitra-Ghosh, Taraswi, Fridley, Brooke L, Lamba, Jatinder K",2015,BMC genomics,2
TA036334,10.1186/s12864-015-1214-0,Transcriptome analysis reveals in vitro cultured Withania somnifera leaf and roottissues as a promising source for targeted withanolide biosynthesis.,"BACKGROUND: The production of metabolites via in vitro culture is promoted by theavailability of fully defined metabolic pathways. Withanolides, the majorbioactive phytochemicals of Withania somnifera, have been well studied for theirpharmacological activities. However, only a few attempts have been made toidentify key candidate genes involved in withanolide biosynthesis. Understandingthe steps involved in withanolide biosynthesis is essential for metabolicengineering of this plant to increase withanolide production. RESULTS:Transcriptome sequencing was performed on in vitro adventitious root and leaftissues using the Illumina platform. We obtained a total of 177,156 assembledtranscripts with an average unigene length of 1,033 bp. About 13% of thetranscripts were unique to in vitro adventitious roots but no unique transcriptswere observed in in vitro-grown leaves. A putative withanolide biosyntheticpathway was deduced by mapping the assembled transcripts to the KEGG database,and the expression of candidate withanolide biosynthesis genes -were validated byqRT PCR. The accumulation pattern of withaferin A and withanolide A variedaccording to the type of tissue and the culture period. Further, we demonstratedthat in vitro leaf extracts exhibit anticancer activity against human gastricadenocarcinoma cell lines at sub G1 phase. CONCLUSIONS: We report here avalidated large-scale transcriptome data set and the potential biologicalactivity of in vitro cultures of W. somnifera. This study provides importantinformation to enhance tissue-specific expression and accumulation of secondarymetabolites, paving the way for industrialization of in vitro cultures of W.somnifera.","Senthil, Kalaiselvi, Jayakodi, Murukarthick, Thirugnanasambantham, Pankajavalli, Lee, Sang Choon, Duraisamy, Pradeepa, Purushotham, Preethi M, Rajasekaran, Kalaiselvi, Nancy Charles, Shobana, Mariam Roy, Irene, Nagappan, Arul Kumar, Kim, Gon Sup, Lee, Yun Sun, Natesan, Senthil, Min, Tae-Sun, Yang, Tae Jin",2015,BMC genomics,2
TA036346,10.1021/cb500120x,Monoterpene glycoside ESK246 from Pittosporum targets LAT3 amino acid transportand prostate cancer cell growth.,"The L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) family consists of four members (LAT1-4)that mediate uptake of neutral amino acids including leucine. Leucine is not onlyimportant as a building block for proteins, but plays a critical role in mTORC1signaling leading to protein translation. As such, LAT family members arecommonly upregulated in cancer in order to fuel increased protein translation andcell growth. To identify potential LAT-specific inhibitors, we established afunction-based high-throughput screen using a prefractionated natural productlibrary. We identified and purified two novel monoterpene glycosides, ESK242 andESK246, sourced from a Queensland collection of the plant Pittosporum venulosum.Using Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing individual LAT family members, wedemonstrated that ESK246 preferentially inhibits leucine transport via LAT3,while ESK242 inhibits both LAT1 and LAT3. We further show in LNCaP prostatecancer cells that ESK246 is a potent (IC50 = 8.12 μM) inhibitor of leucineuptake, leading to reduced mTORC1 signaling, cell cycle protein expression andcell proliferation. Our study suggests that ESK246 is a LAT3 inhibitor that canbe used to study LAT3 function and upon which new antiprostate cancer therapiesmay be based.","Wang, Qian, Grkovic, Tanja, Font, Josep, Bonham, Sarah, Pouwer, Rebecca H, Bailey, Charles G, Moran, Anne M, Ryan, Renae M, Rasko, John E J, Jormakka, Mika, Quinn, Ronald J, Holst, Jeff",2014,ACS chemical biology,2
TA036350,10.1371/journal.pone.0092216,The complex regulation of tanshinone IIA in rats with hypertension-induced leftventricular hypertrophy.,"Tanshinone IIA has definite protective effects on various cardiovasculardiseases. However, in hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy (H-LVH),the signaling pathways of tanshinone IIA in inhibition of remodeling and cardiacdysfunction remain unclear. Two-kidney, one-clip induced hypertensive rats(n = 32) were randomized to receive tanshinone IIA (5, 10, 15 mg/kg per day) or5% glucose injection (GS). Sham-operated rats (n = 8) received 5%GS as control.Cardiac function and dimensions were assessed by using an echocardiographysystem. Histological determination of the fibrosis and apoptosis was performedusing hematoxylin eosin, Masson's trichrome and TUNEL staining. Matrixmetalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases type2 (TIMP2) protein expressions in rat myocardial tissues were detected byimmunohistochemistry. Rat cardiomyocytes were isolated by a Langendorff perfusionmethod. After 48 h culture, the supernatant and cardiomyocytes were collected todetermine the potential related proteins impact on cardiac fibrosis andapoptosis. Compared with the sham rats, the heart tissues of H-LVH (5%GS) groupsuffered severely from the oxidative damage, apoptosis of cardiomyocytes andextracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In the H-LVH group, tanshinone IIA treateddecreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD)activity. Tanshinone IIA inhibited cardiomyocytes apoptosis as confirmed by thereduction of TUNEL positive cardiomyocytes and the down-regulation of Caspase-3activity and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Meanwhile, plasma apelin level increased withdown-regulation of APJ receptor. Tanshinone IIA suppressed cardiac fibrosisthrough regulating the paracrine factors released by cardiomyocytes and theTGF-β/Smads signaling pathway activity. In conclusion, our in vivo study showedthat tanshinone IIA could improve heart function by enhancing myocardialcontractility, inhibiting ECM deposition, and limiting apoptosis ofcardiomyocytes and oxidative damage.","Pang, Hui, Han, Bing, Yu, Tao, Peng, Zhen",2014,PloS one,2
TA036367,10.1038/srep05201,Evaluating the binding efficiency of pheromone binding protein with its naturalligand using molecular docking and fluorescence analysis.,"Chemosignals play a crucial role in social and sexual communication among inter-and intra-species. Chemical cues are bound with protein that is present in thepheromones irrespective of sex are commonly called as pheromone binding protein(PBP). In rats, the pheromone compounds are bound with low molecular lipocalinprotein α2u-globulin (α2u). We reported farnesol is a natural endogenous ligand(compound) present in rat preputial gland as a bound volatile compound. In thepresent study, an attempt has been made through computational method toevaluating the binding efficiency of α2u with the natural ligand (farnesol) andstandard fluorescent molecule (2-naphthol). The docking analysis revealed thatthe binding energy of farnesol and 2-naphthol was almost equal and likely toshare some binding pocket of protein. Further, to extrapolate the resultsgenerated through computational approach, the α2u protein was purified andsubjected to fluorescence titration and binding assay. The results showed thatthe farnesol is replaced by 2-naphthol with high hydrophobicity of TYR120 inbinding sites of α2u providing an acceptable dissociation constant indicating thebinding efficiency of α2u. The obtained results are in corroboration with thedata made through computational approach.","Ilayaraja, Renganathan, Rajkumar, Ramalingam, Rajesh, Durairaj, Muralidharan, Arumugam Ramachandran, Padmanabhan, Parasuraman, Archunan, Govindaraju",2014,Scientific reports,2

TA036400,10.18632/oncotarget.4510,Inhibition of Lon protease by triterpenoids alters mitochondria and is associatedto cell death in human cancer cells.,"Mitochondrial Lon protease (Lon) regulates several mitochondrial functions, andis inhibited by the anticancer molecule triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO), or by its C-28 methyl esterderivative (CDDO-Me). To analyze the mechanism of action of triterpenoids, weinvestigated intramitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrialmembrane potential, mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial dynamics and morphology,and Lon proteolytic activity in RKO human colon cancer cells, in HepG2hepatocarcinoma cells and in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells. We found that CDDO andCDDO-Me are potent stressors for mitochondria in cancer cells, rather than normalnon-transformed cells. In particular, they: i) cause depolarization; ii) increasemitochondrial ROS, iii) alter mitochondrial morphology and proteins involved inmitochondrial dynamics; iv) affect the levels of Lon and those of aconitase andhuman transcription factor A, which are targets of Lon activity; v) increaselevel of protein carbonyls in mitochondria; vi) lead to intrinsic apoptosis. Theoverexpression of Lon can rescue cells from cell death, providing an additionalevidence on the role of Lon in conditions of excessive stress load.","Gibellini, Lara, Pinti, Marcello, Bartolomeo, Regina, De Biasi, Sara, Cormio, Antonella, Musicco, Clara, Carnevale, Gianluca, Pecorini, Simone, Nasi, Milena, De Pol, Anto, Cossarizza, Andrea",2015,Oncotarget,2
TA036442,10.12659/msm.898483,Actein Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Migration in Human Osteosarcoma.,"BACKGROUND Osteosarcoma is one of the most common malignant bone cancersworldwide. Although the traditional chemotherapies have made some progression inthe past decades, the mortality of osteosarcoma in children and adolescent isvery high. Herein, the role of actein in osteosarcoma was explored. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS Cell viability assay was performed in osteosarcoma cell lines 143B andU2OS. Colony formation analysis was included when cells were treated withdifferent doses of actin. Cell cycle assay was conducted to further examine therole of actein. Cell apoptotic rate and the relative activities of caspase-3,caspase-8, and caspase-9 were detected in 143B and U2OS osteosarcoma cells.Moreover, transwell assays were used to explore the effects of actein on cellmetastasis. RESULTS Actein significantly inhibited osteosarcoma cell viability ina time- and dose-dependent manner. Actein also dramatically suppressed the colonyformation ability in osteosarcoma143B and U2OS cells. It was revealed thatosteosarcoma cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase in the cell cycle progression andinduced to apoptosis by administration of actein. The activities of pro-apoptoticfactors such as caspase-3 and caspase-9 were significantly increased by actein.Furthermore, administration of actein decreased cell migrated and invasiveabilities in both 143B and U2OS cell lines. CONCLUSIONS Actein inhibits tumorgrowth by inducing cell apoptosis in osteosarcoma. The inhibitive roles of acteinin cell proliferation, migration and invasion suggest that actein may serve as apotential therapeutic agent in the treatment of osteosarcoma.","Chen, Zhi, Wu, Jingdong, Guo, Qinghao",2016,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental andclinical research,2

TA036457,10.1371/journal.pone.0098079,Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol prevents methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent psychostimulant with neurotoxic properties.Heavy use increases the activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS),production of peroxynitrites, microglia stimulation, and induces hyperthermia andanorectic effects. Most METH recreational users also consume cannabis.Preclinical studies have shown that natural (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, Δ9-THC) andsynthetic cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists exert neuroprotective effectson different models of cerebral damage. Here, we investigated the neuroprotectiveeffect of Δ9-THC on METH-induced neurotoxicity by examining its ability to reduceastrocyte activation and nNOS overexpression in selected brain areas. Ratsexposed to a METH neurotoxic regimen (4 × 10 mg/kg, 2 hours apart) were pre- orpost-treated with Δ9-THC (1 or 3 mg/kg) and sacrificed 3 days after the last METHadministration. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed usingantibodies against nNOS and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP). Resultsshowed that, as compared to corresponding controls (i) METH-induced nNOSoverexpression in the caudate-putamen (CPu) was significantly attenuated by pre-and post-treatment with both doses of Δ9-THC (-19% and -28% for 1 mg/kg pre- andpost-treated animals; -25% and -21% for 3 mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals);(ii) METH-induced GFAP-immunoreactivity (IR) was significantly reduced in the CPuby post-treatment with 1 mg/kg Δ9-THC1 (-50%) and by pre-treatment with 3 mg/kgΔ9-THC (-53%); (iii) METH-induced GFAP-IR was significantly decreased in theprefrontal cortex (PFC) by pre- and post-treatment with both doses of Δ9-THC(-34% and -47% for 1 mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals; -37% and -29% for 3mg/kg pre- and post-treated animals). The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonistSR141716A attenuated METH-induced nNOS overexpression in the CPu, but failed tocounteract the Δ9-THC-mediated reduction of METH-induced GFAP-IR both in the PFCand CPu. Our results indicate that Δ9-THC reduces METH-induced brain damage viainhibition of nNOS expression and astrocyte activation through CB1-dependent andindependent mechanisms, respectively.","Castelli, M Paola, Madeddu, Camilla, Casti, Alberto, Casu, Angelo, Casti, Paola, Scherma, Maria, Fattore, Liana, Fadda, Paola, Ennas, M Grazia",2014,PloS one,2

The exact pathogenicmechanisms and the molecular events underlying DN development remain unclear.Ginsenoside Rg3 is a herbal medicine with numerous pharmacological effects. Togain a greater understanding of the molecular mechanism and signaling pathwayunderlying the effect of ginsenoside Rg3 in DN therapy, an RNA sequencingapproach was performed to screen differential gene expression in a rat model ofDN treated with ginsenoside Rg3. A combined bioinformatics analysis was thenconducted to obtain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of thedisease development, in order to identify potential novel targets for thetreatment of DN. Six Sprague‑Dawley male rats were randomly divided into3 groups: Normal control group, DN group and ginsenoside‑Rg3 treatment group,with two rats in each group. RNA sequencing was adopted for transcriptomeprofiling of cells from the renal cortex of DN rat model. Differentiallyexpressed genes were screened out. Cluster analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) and KyotoEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were used to analyzethe differentially expressed genes. In total, 78 differentially expressed genesin the DN control group were identified when compared with the normal controlgroup, of which 52 genes were upregulated and 26 genes were downregulated.Differential expression of 43 genes was observed in the ginsenoside‑Rg3 treatmentgroup when compared with the DN control group, consisting of 10 upregulated genesand 33 downregulated genes. Notably, 21 that were downregulated in the DN controlgroup compared with the control were then shown to be upregulated in theginsenoside‑Rg3 treatment group compared with the DN control group. In addition,7 upregulated genes in the DN control group compared with the control were thenshown to be downregulated in the ginsenoside‑Rg3 treatment group compared withthe DN control group. Cluster analysis based on differentially expressed genesindicated that the transcriptomes are quite different among the samples. DistinctGO terms associated with these groups of genes were shown to be enriched. KEGGpathway analysis demonstrated that differentially expressed genes werepredominantly involved in the fatty acid metabolism pathway and peroxisomeproliferator‑activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. To the best of ourknowledge, this study was the first to present whole genome expression profilingin DN with ginsenoside‑Rg3 treatment by RNA‑Seq. A set of differentiallyexpressed genes and pathways were identified. These data provided an insight intounderstanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of ginsenoside‑Rg3treatment of DN.","Wang, Juan, Cui, Chunli, Fu, Li, Xiao, Zili, Xie, Nanzi, Liu, Yang, Yu, Lu, Wang, Haifeng, Luo, Bangzhen",2016,Molecular medicine reports,2

Crocin, a bioactive component of saffron, has been found toexert anti-inflammatory effects on cartilage. In the present study, theanti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic effects of crocin on rat IVDs were analyzedin vitro and ex vivo. Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were isolated from the lumbarIVDs of Sprague-Dawley rats. The NP cells were first treated with variousconcentrations of crocin, and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) toinduce inflammation. Subsequently, RT-qPCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assaywere carried out to measure the expression levels of catabolic enzymes,pro-inflammatory factors and the components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Inaddition, western blot analysis was also used to investigate the relatedsignaling pathways. The whole spinal motion segment (vertebra-IVD-vertebrasection) of the rats was isolated and cultured in the presence or absence of LPSand crocin for 7 days. The ex vivo effects of crocin on the ECM of the IVDstructures were determined by histological and biochemical analysis. In vitro,crocin significantly inhibited the LPS-induced overexpression of catabolicenzymes [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, a disintegrin-like andmetalloprotease (reprolysin type) with thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS)-4 andADAMTS‑5], pro-inflammatory factors [interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α, IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)] and Toll-like receptor(TLR)‑2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, crocin partly prevented thedownregulation of aggrecan and type II collagen (collagen‑II). Moreover, crocinsuppressed the LPS-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK). Ex vivo experiments demonstrated that crocin protected the rat IVDs fromthe LPS-induced depletion of the ECM components, including proteoglycan andcollagen-II. In conclusion, crocin effectively suppressed thedegeneration-related inflammation and catabolism in rat IVDs in vitro and exvivo, suggesting that crocin has potential for use as a therapuetic strategy inthe treatment of LBP.","Li, Kang, Li, Yan, Ma, Zhenjiang, Zhao, Jie",2015,International journal of molecular medicine,2

However, theeffects of β-elemene on malignant phenotypes of human glioblastoma cells remainto be elucidated. Here we evaluated the effects of β-elemene on cellproliferation, survival, stemness, differentiation and theepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo, and investigatedthe mechanisms underlying these effects. METHODS: Human primary and U87glioblastoma cells were treated with β-elemene, cell viability was measured usinga cell counting kit-8 assay, and treated cells were evaluated by flow cytometry.Western blot analysis was carried out to determine the expression levels ofstemness markers, differentiation-related molecules and EMT-related effectors.Transwell assays were performed to further determine EMT of glioblastoma cells.To evaluate the effect of β-elemene on glioblastoma in vivo, we subcutaneouslyinjected glioblastoma cells into the flank of nude mice and thenintraperitoneally injected NaCl or β-elemene. The tumor xenograft volumes weremeasured every 3 days and the expression of stemness-, differentiation- andEMT-related effectors was determined by Western blot assays in xenografts.RESULTS: β-Elemene inhibited proliferation, promoted apoptosis, impairedinvasiveness in glioblastoma cells and suppressed the growth of animalxenografts. The expression levels of the stemness markers CD133 and ATP-bindingcassette subfamily G member 2 as well as the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin andβ-catenin were significantly downregulated, whereas the expression levels of thedifferentiation-related effectors glial fibrillary acidic protein, Notch1, andsonic hedgehog as well as the epithelial marker E-cadherin were upregulated byβ-elemene in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the expression of vimentin wasincreased by β-elemene in vitro; this result was opposite that for the in vivoprocedure. Inhibiting β-catenin enhanced the anti-proliferative, EMT-inhibitoryand specific marker expression-regulatory effects of β-elemene. CONCLUSIONS:β-Elemene reversed malignant phenotypes of human glioblastoma cells throughβ-catenin-involved regulation of stemness-, differentiation- and EMT-relatedmolecules. β-Elemene represents a potentially valuable agent for glioblastomatherapy.","Zhu, Tingzhun, Li, Xiaoming, Luo, Lihan, Wang, Xiaogang, Li, Zhiqing, Xie, Peng, Gao, Xu, Song, Zhenquan, Su, Jingyuan, Liang, Guobiao",2015,Journal of translational medicine,2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CFs were isolated from neonatalSprague-Dawley rats by trypsin digestion and differential adhesion and stimulatedwith 5 ng/mL TGFβ1 and TSN (10(-6), 10(-5), or 10(-4) mol/L). The expression offibronectin (FN) mRNA in the CFs was determined using reversetranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction and the protein expression of FN andSmads in CFs was detected using Western blot. The intracellular expression andlocalization of Smads in the CFs were analyzed using immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: TGFβ1 induced the expression of FN and Smads in a time-dependent manner.At the end of the culture treatment, the mRNA expression of FN and the expressionof phosphorylated Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) increased significantly (P < 0.01). TSNpretreatment (10(-5) and 10(-4) mol/L) reduced the expression of FN and p-Smad2/3(P < 0.01) following TGFβ1 stimulation and led to a significant decrease in thenuclear staining intensity and a positive rate of p-Smad2/3 (P < 0.05 and P <0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect of TSN on myocardialfibrosis may be associated with its inhibition of TGFβ1-induced Smad2/3phosphorylation and p-Smad2/3 nuclear translocation, which blocks the TGFβ1/Smadsignaling pathway in CFs.","Zhan, Cheng-Ye, Tang, Jin-Hui, Zhou, Dai-Xing, Li, Zhi-Hui",2014,Indian journal of pharmacology,2
TA036572,10.3390/ijms17020177,Ginsenoside-Rd Promotes Neurite Outgrowth of PC12 Cells through MAPK/ERK- andPI3K/AKT-Dependent Pathways.,"Panax ginseng is a famous herbal medicine widely used in Asia. Ginsenosides havebeen identified as the principle active ingredients for Panax ginseng'sbiological activity, among which ginsenoside Rd (Rd) attracts extensive attentionfor its obvious neuroprotective activities. Here we investigated the effect of Rdon neurite outgrowth, a crucial process associated with neuronal repair. PC12cells, which respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) and serve as a model forneuronal cells, were treated with different concentrations of Rd, and then theirneurite outgrowth was evaluated. Our results showed that 10 μM Rd significantlyincreased the percentages of long neurite- and branching neurite-bearing cells,compared with respective controls. The length of the longest neurites and thetotal length of neurites in Rd-treated PC12 cells were much longer than that ofrespective controls. We also showed that Rd activated ERK1/2 and AKT but not PKCsignalings, and inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059 or/and AKT by LY294002effectively attenuated Rd-induced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, Rd upregulated theexpression of GAP-43, a neuron-specific protein involved in neurite outgrowth,while PD98059 or/and LY294002 decreased Rd-induced increased GAP-43 expression.Taken together, our results provided the first evidence that Rd may promote theneurite outgrowth of PC12 cells by upregulating GAP-43 expression via ERK- andARK-dependent signaling pathways.","Wu, Song-Di, Xia, Feng, Lin, Xue-Mei, Duan, Kang-Li, Wang, Fang, Lu, Qing-Li, Cao, Huan, Qian, Yi-Hua, Shi, Ming",2016,International journal of molecular sciences,2
TA036574,10.1371/journal.pone.0147570,Squalene Inhibits ATM-Dependent Signaling in γIR-Induced DNA Damage Responsethrough Induction of Wip1 Phosphatase.,"Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase plays a crucial role as a mastercontroller in the cellular DNA damage response. Inhibition of ATM leads toinhibition of the checkpoint signaling pathway. Hence, addition of checkpointinhibitors to anticancer therapies may be an effective targeting strategy. Arecent study reported that Wip1, a protein phosphatase, de-phosphorylates serine1981 of ATM during the DNA damage response. Squalene has been proposed tocomplement anticancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy; however,there is little mechanistic information supporting this idea. Here, we report theinhibitory effect of squalene on ATM-dependent DNA damage signals. Squaleneitself did not affect cell viability and the cell cycle of A549 cells, but itenhanced the cytotoxicity of gamma-irradiation (γIR). The in vitro kinaseactivity of ATM was not altered by squalene. However, squalene increased Wip1expression in cells and suppressed ATM activation in γIR-treated cells.Consistent with the potential inhibition of ATM by squalene, IR-inducedphosphorylation of ATM effectors such as p53 (Ser15) and Chk1 (Ser317) wasinhibited by cell treatment with squalene. Thus, squalene inhibits theATM-dependent signaling pathway following DNA damage through intracellularinduction of Wip1 expression.","Tatewaki, Naoto, Konishi, Tetsuya, Nakajima, Yuki, Nishida, Miyako, Saito, Masafumi, Eitsuka, Takahiro, Sakamaki, Toshiyuki, Ikekawa, Nobuo, Nishida, Hiroshi",2016,PloS one,2
TA036586,10.1111/jcmm.12347,Astaxanthin inhibits apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells type II in vivo andin vitro through the ROS-dependent mitochondrial signalling pathway.,"Oxidative stress is an important molecular mechanism underlying lung fibrosis.The mitochondrion is a major organelle for oxidative stress in cells. Therefore,blocking the mitochondrial signalling pathway may be the best therapeuticmanoeuver to ameliorate lung fibrosis. Astaxanthin (AST) is an excellentantioxidant, but no study has addressed the pathway of AST against pulmonaryoxidative stress and free radicals by the mitochondrion-mediated signallingpathway. In this study, we investigated the antioxidative effects of AST againstH2 O2 - or bleomycin (BLM)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) production in alveolar epithelial cells type II (AECs-II) in vivoand in vitro. Our data show that AST blocks H2 O2 - or BLM-induced ROS generationand dose-dependent apoptosis in AECs-II, as characterized by changes in cell andmitochondria morphology, translocation of apoptotic proteins, inhibition ofcytochrome c (Cyt c) release, and the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, Nrf-2and other cytoprotective genes. These data suggest that AST inhibits apoptosis inAECs-II cells through the ROS-dependent mitochondrial signalling pathway and maybe of potential therapeutic value in lung fibrosis treatment.","Song, Xiaodong, Wang, Bingsi, Lin, Shengcui, Jing, Lili, Mao, Cuiping, Xu, Pan, Lv, Changjun, Liu, Wen, Zuo, Ji",2014,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2
TA036587,10.1038/srep06352,Notoginsenoside R1 increases neuronal excitability and ameliorates synaptic andmemory dysfunction following amyloid elevation.,"Neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD)have been associated with progressive decrease in neuronal activity. Here, weinvestigated the effects of Notoginsenoside R1 (NTR1), a major saponin isolatedfrom Panax notoginseng, on neuronal excitability and assessed the beneficialeffects of NTR1 on synaptic and memory deficits under the Aβ-enriched conditionsin vivo and in vitro. We assessed the effects of NTR1 on neuronal excitability,membrane ion channel activity, and synaptic plasticity in acute hippocampalslices by combining electrophysiological extracellular and intracellularrecording techniques. We found that NTR1 increased the membrane excitability ofCA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices by lowering the spike thresholdpossibly through a mechanism involving in the inhibition of voltage-gated K(+)currents. In addition, NTR1 reversed Aβ1-42 oligomers-induced impairments in longterm potentiation (LTP). Reducing spontaneous firing activity with 10 nMtetrodotoxin (TTX) abolished the protective effect of NTR1 against Aβ-induced LTPimpairment. Finally, oral administration of NTR1 improved the learningperformance of the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Our work reveals a novel mechanisminvolving in modulation of cell strength, which contributes to the protectiveeffects of NTR1 against Aβ neurotoxicity.","Yan, Shijun, Li, Zhi, Li, Hang, Arancio, Ottavio, Zhang, Wensheng",2014,Scientific reports,2
TA036613,10.3390/ijms17030365,Geranylgeraniol and Neurological Impairment: Involvement of Apoptosis andMitochondrial Morphology.,"Deregulation of the cholesterol pathway is an anomaly observed in human diseases,many of which have in common neurological involvement and unknown pathogenesis.In this study we have used Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) as a disease-modelin order to investigate the link between the deregulation of the mevalonatepathway and the consequent neurodegeneration. The blocking of the mevalonatepathway in a neuronal cell line (Daoy), using statins or mevalonate, induced anincrease in the expression of the inflammasome gene (NLRP3) and programmed celldeath related to mitochondrial dysfunction. The morphology of the mitochondriachanged, clearly showing the damage induced by oxidative stress and the decreasedmembrane potential associated with the alterations of the mitochondrial function.The co-administration of geranylgeraniol (GGOH) reduced the inflammatory markerand the damage of the mitochondria, maintaining its shape and components. Ourdata allow us to speculate about the mechanism by which isoprenoids are able torescue the inflammatory marker in neuronal cells, independently from the block ofthe mevalonate pathway, and about the fact that cell death ismitochondria-related.","Marcuzzi, Annalisa, Piscianz, Elisa, Zweyer, Marina, Bortul, Roberta, Loganes, Claudia, Girardelli, Martina, Baj, Gabriele, Monasta, Lorenzo, Celeghini, Claudio",2016,International journal of molecular sciences,2
TA036622,10.1186/s12943-015-0470-6,Minnelide effectively eliminates CD133(+) side population in pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating diseasehallmarked by limited patient survival. Resistance to chemotherapy, a major causeof treatment failure in PDAC patients, is often attributed to Cancer Stem Cells(CSCs). Pancreatic CSCs are a small subset of quiescent cells within a tumorrepresented by surface markers like CD133. These cells are responsible not onlyfor tumor recurrence, but also poor prognosis based on their ""stem-like""characteristics. At present, conventional therapy is directed towards rapidlydividing PDAC cells and thus fails to target the CSC population. METHODS: MIAPaCa-2, S2-013 and AsPC-1 were treated with 12.5 nM triptolide (12 T cells) for 7days. The surviving cells were recovered briefly in drug-free growth media andthen transferred to Cancer Stem cell Media (CSM). As a control, untreated cellswere also transferred to CSM media (CSM). The 12 T and CSM cells were tested forstemness properties using RNA and protein markers. Low numbers of CSM and 12 Tcells were implanted subcutaneously in athymic nude mice to study theirtumorigenic potential. 12 T and CSM cells were sorted for CD133 expression andassayed for their colony forming ability and sphere forming ability. Invasivenessof 12 T cells, CSM and MIA PaCa-2 were compared using Boyden chamber assays.RESULTS: Treated 12 T cells displayed increased expression of the surface markerCD133 and the drug transporter ABCG2 compared to untreated cells (CSM cells).Both 12 T and CSM cells formed subcutaneous tumors in mice confirming theirtumor-initiating properties. When tested for invasion, 12 T cells had increasedinvasiveness compared to CSM cells. CD133(+) cells in both CSM and 12 T showedgreater colony and sphere forming ability compared to CD133(-) cells from eachgroup. Consistent with these data, when injected subcutaneously in mice, CD133(-)cells from CSM or 12 T did not form any tumors whereas CD133(+) cells from bothgroups showed tumor formation at a very low cell number. Despite pre-exposure totriptolide in 12 T CD133(+) cells, treatment of tumors formed by these cells withMinnelide, a triptolide pro-drug, showed significant tumor regression.CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that triptolide enhanced and enriched the""stemness"" in the PDAC cell lines at a low dose of 12.5 nM, but also resulted inthe regression of tumors derived from these cells.","Nomura, Alice, McGinn, Olivia, Dudeja, Vikas, Sangwan, Veena, Saluja, Ashok K, Banerjee, Sulagna",2015,Molecular cancer,2

However, the neuronal mechanism underlying DHF action remainsunknown. This study aimed to investigate the action of DHF on GABAA receptorsusing a silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) model. Additionally, we investigated theeffect of DHF exposure on stress-induced cortisol modulation. Chemicalidentification was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry andpurity was evaluated using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector.To an aquarium, we applied between 2.5 and 50 mg/L DHF diluted in ethanol, incombination with 42.7 mg/L diazepam. DHF within the range of 10-20 mg/L actedcollaboratively in combination with diazepam, but the sedative action of DHF wasreversed by 3 mg/L flumazenil. Additionally, fish exposed for 24 h to 2.5-20 mg/LDHF showed no side effects and there was sustained sedation during the first 12 hof drug exposure with 10-20 mg/L DHF. DHF pretreatment did not increase plasmacortisol levels in fish subjected to a stress protocol. Moreover, thestress-induced cortisol peak was absent following pretreatment with 20 mg/L DHF.DHF proved to be a relatively safe sedative or anesthetic, which interacts withGABAergic and cortisol pathways in fish.","Garlet, Q I, Pires, L C, Silva, D T, Spall, S, Gressler, L T, Bürger, M E, Baldisserotto, B, Heinzmann, B M",2016,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira depesquisas medicas e biologicas,2
TA036705,10.1093/jxb/erv012,Suppression of tubulin detyrosination by parthenolide recruits the plant-specifickinesin KCH to cortical microtubules.,"Detyrosination of α-tubulin seems to be conserved in all eukaryotes. However, itsbiological function in plants has remained obscure. A conserved C-terminaltyrosine is removed by a still unidentified tubulin-tyrosine carboxypeptidase(TTC) and can be religated by a tubulin-tyrosine ligase (TTL). To obtain insightinto the still elusive biological function of this detyrosination-tyrosinationcycle, the effects of the TTC inhibitor parthenolide were analysed in BY-2tobacco cells. Parthenolide caused a depletion of detyrosinated α-tubulin,whereas the level of tyrosinated tubulin was elevated. This biochemical effectwas accompanied by growth inhibition in cycling BY-2 cells and alteration ofmicrotubule-dependent events that define division and expansion geometry such ascell plate alignment or axial expansion. Furthermore, parthenolide triggered anapoplastic alkalinization indicative of activation of defence-related calciuminflux channels. At the same time, parthenolide promoted the association of theplant-specific kinesin KCH with cortical microtubules. These observations areintegrated into a working model, where detyrosination acts as signal to modulatethe binding of kinesin motors involved in structural and sensory functions of themicrotubular cytoskeleton.","Schneider, Natalie, Ludwig, Holger, Nick, Peter",2015,Journal of experimental botany,2

However, the mechanisms by which this compoundelicited its anti-inflammatory activity remain to be elucidated. In this study,we analyzed the effects of AA on inflammatory gene expression in two differentcell types with primordial importance in the inflammatory processes - endothelialcells and macrophages. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, AA inhibitedthe expression of inflammatory proteins including the adhesion moleculesintercellular adhesion molecule 1; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; andE-selectin, as well as the release of the chemokine interleukin-8. Additionally,AA hindered the formation of capillary-like tubes in an in vitro model ofangiogenesis. AA's effects in endothelial cells can be attributed at least inpart to AA's inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nuclear factor ofkappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (NF-κB)'s translocation. Also,in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells, AA was able todownregulate the expression of the genes cyclooxygenase 2, inducible nitric oxidesynthase, interleukin-6, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2. Moreover, AAinhibited the phosphorylation of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide geneenhancer in B-cells inhibitor-alpha (IκBα), IκB kinase (IKK), and themitogen-activated protein kinases JNK, ERK, and p38. In conclusion, the presentresults further support the anti-inflammatory potential of AA in different modelsof inflammation.","Achoui, Mouna, Heyninck, Karen, Looi, Chung Yeng, Mustafa, Ali Mohd, Haegeman, Guy, Mustafa, Mohd Rais",2014,"Drug design, development and therapy",2
TA036767,10.2147/DDDT.S84527,20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 promotes senescence and apoptosis in gallbladder cancercells via the p53 pathway.,"Gallbladder cancer (GBC), the most frequent malignancy of the biliary tract, isassociated with high mortality and extremely poor prognosis. 20(S)-ginsenosideRg3 (20(S)-Rg3) is a steroidal saponin with high pharmacological activity.However, the anticancer effect of 20(S)-Rg3 in human GBC has not yet beendetermined. In this study, we primarily found that 20(S)-Rg3 exposure suppressedthe survival of both NOZ and GBC-SD cell lines in a concentration-dependentmanner. Moreover, induction of cellular senescence and G0/G1 arrest by 20(S)-Rg3were accompanied by a large accumulation of p53 and p21 as a result of murinedouble minute 2 (MDM2) inhibition. 20(S)-Rg3 also caused a remarkable increase inapoptosis via the activation of the mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic caspasepathway. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of 20(S)-Rg3 (20 or 40 mg/kg) for3 weeks markedly inhibited the growth of xenografts in nude mice. Our resultsdemonstrated that 20(S)-Rg3 potently inhibited growth and survival of GBC cellsboth in vitro and in vivo. 20(S)-Rg3 attenuated GBC growth probably viaactivation of the p53 pathway, and subsequent induction of cellular senescenceand mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.

A proteomicapproach was used to purify and identify the differentially expressed proteinsfollowing erinacine A treatment and the mechanism of its action in apoptotic andthe targets of erinacine A. Our results demonstrate that erinacine A treatment ofHCT-116 and DLD-1 cells increased cell cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species(ROS) production as well as decreased cell proliferation and invasiveness. Tendifferentially displayed proteins were determined and validated in vitro and invivo between the erinacine A-treated and untreated groups. In addition, erinacineA time-dependent induction of cell death and inhibitory invasiveness wasassociated with sustained phosphorylation of the PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K andROCK1/LIMK2/Cofilin pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated that erinacineA-induced HCT-116 and DLD-1 cells viability and anti-invasion properties byup-regulating the activation of PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K and production of ROS.Experiments involving specific inhibitors demonstrated that the differentialexpression of cofilin-1 (COFL1) and profilin-1 (PROF1) during erinacine Atreatment could be involved in the mechanisms of HCT-116 and DLD-1 cells deathand decreased aggressiveness, which occurred via ROCK1/LIMK2/Cofilin expression,with activation of the PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K signalling pathway.

TA037229,10.2147/IJN.S34991,Effect of cell-penetrating peptide-coated nanostructured lipid carriers on theoral absorption of tripterine.,"PURPOSE: To develop nanostructured-lipid carriers (NLCs) coated withcell-penetrating peptides (CPP) for improving the oral bioavailability oftripterine. METHODS: We prepared CPP-coated tripterine-loaded NLCs (CT-NLCs) byusing a solvent evaporation method, and determined their physical properties. Invitro drug release was determined by using a dialysis bag diffusion technique,and intestinal toxicity was evaluated by performing MTT assay using Caco-2 cells.In vivo absorption was studied in an in situ rat intestinal perfusion model, andoral bioavailability was examined in beagles. RESULTS: The average particle size,zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of the optimized CT-NLCs were 126.7± 9.2 nm, 28.7 ± 3.4 mV, and 72.64% ± 1.37%, respectively. The CT-NLCs showed acontrolled release profile in vitro and had significantly lower intestinalcytotoxicity than the tripterine solution (P < 0.05). The absorption levels oftripterine from the CT-NLCs in the rat duodenum and jejunum were markedly higherthan with tripterine-loaded NLCs without the CPP coating (T-NLCs), and withtripterine solution. Pharmacokinetic study showed that the maximum concentrationof the CT-NLCs was greater than that of the T-NLCs and tripterine suspension, andthat the time to maximum concentration of the CT-NLCs as well as the T-NLCs, waslonger than that of the tripterine suspension. The relative oral bioavailabilityof the CT-NLCs compared to that of tripterine suspension and T-NLCs were 484.75%and 149.91% respectively. CONCLUSION: The oral bioavailability of tripterine isdramatically increased by CT-NLCs. Therefore, CT-NLCs seem to be a promisingcarrier for oral delivery of tripterine.","Chen, Yan, Yuan, Ling, Zhou, Lei, Zhang, Zhen-hai, Cao, Wei, Wu, Qingqing",2012,International journal of nanomedicine,2

A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the exact roles ofintravesical RTX for the treatment of storage LUTS in patients with eitherinterstitial cystitis (IC) or detrusor overactivity (DO). METHODS: Ameta-analysis of RTX treatment was performed through a comprehensive search ofthe literature. In total, 2,332 records were initially recruited, 1,907 fromElsevier, 207 from Medline and 218 from the Web of Science. No records wereretrieved from the Embase or Cochrane Library. Seven trials with 355 patientswere included and one trial was excluded because of the lack of extractable data.The analyses were all performed using RevMan 5.1 and MIX 2.0. RESULTS: Bladderpain was significantly reduced after RTX therapy in patients with either IC orDO. The average decrease of the visual an alogue pain scale was 0.42 after RTXtreatment (p = 0.02). The maximum cystometric capacity (MCC) was significantlyincreased in patients with DO (MCC increase, 53.36 ml, p = 0.006) but not inthose with IC (MCC increase, -19.1 ml, p = 0.35). No significant improvement inurinary frequency, nocturia, incontinence or the first involuntary detrusorcontraction (FDC) was noted after RTX therapy (p = 0.06, p = 0.52, p = 0.19 and p= 0.41, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: RTX could significantly reduce bladder painin patients with either IC or DO, and increase MCC in patients with DO; however,no significant improvement was observed in frequency, nocturia, incontinence orFDC. Given the limitations in the small patient size and risk of bias in theincluded trials, great caution should be taken when intravesical RTX is usedbefore a large, multicenter, well-designed random control trial with a long-termfollow-up is carried out to further assess the clinical efficacy of RTX in inpatients with storage LUTS.","Guo, Changcheng, Yang, Bin, Gu, Wenyu, Peng, Bo, Xia, Shengqiang, Yang, Fengqiang, Wen, Deyi, Geng, Jiang, Zhang, Yuanyuan, Zheng, Junhua",2013,PloS one,2

TA037451,10.1093/jxb/err070,Functional characterization of various algal carotenoid ketolases reveals thatketolating zeaxanthin efficiently is essential for high production of astaxanthinin transgenic Arabidopsis.,"Extending the carotenoid pathway to astaxanthin in plants is of scientific andindustrial interest. However, expression of a microbial β-carotene ketolase (BKT)that catalyses the formation of ketocarotenoids in transgenic plants typicallyresults in low levels of astaxanthin. The low efficiency of BKTs in ketolatingzeaxanthin to astaxanthin is proposed to be the major limitation for astaxanthinaccumulation in engineered plants. To verify this hypothesis, several algal BKTswere functionally characterized using an Escherichia coli system and three BKTswere identified, with high (up to 85%), moderate (∼38%), and low (∼1%) conversionrate from zeaxanthin to astaxanthin from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrBKT),Chlorella zofingiensis (CzBKT), and Haematococcus pluvialis (HpBKT3),respectively. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing the CrBKT developedorange leaves which accumulated astaxanthin up to 2 mg g(-1) dry weight with a1.8-fold increase in total carotenoids. In contrast, the expression of CzBKTresulted in much lower astaxanthin content (0.24 mg g(-1) dry weight), whereasHpBKT3 was unable to mediate synthesis of astaxanthin in A. thaliana. Thenone-native astaxanthin was found mostly in a free form integrated into thelight-harvesting complexes of photosystem II in young leaves but in esterifiedforms in senescent leaves. The alteration of carotenoids did not affectchlorophyll content, plant growth, or development significantly. Theastaxanthin-producing plants were more tolerant to high light as shown by reducedlipid peroxidation. This study advances a decisive step towards the utilizationof plants for the production of high-value astaxanthin.","Zhong, Yu-Juan, Huang, Jun-Chao, Liu, Jin, Li, Yin, Jiang, Yue, Xu, Zeng-Fu, Sandmann, Gerhard, Chen, Feng",2011,Journal of experimental botany,2

Studiesby Eckstein-Ludwig and co-workers showed both thapsigargin and artemisininspecifically inhibit the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase of Plasmodiumfalciparum (PfATP6). In the present study the type of interaction betweenthapsigargin and artemisinin derivatives as well as the ozonide OZ277 (RBx11160or arterolane) was evaluated in parasite cultures. The latter compound is anadamantane-based peroxide and the first fully synthetic clinical candidaterecently registered in India by Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. for anti-malarialcombination therapy. METHODS: Drug interaction studies were performed using apreviously described fixed ratio method and anti-malarial activity measured usingthe [3H] hypoxanthine incorporation assay. RESULTS: The sum 50% and 90%fractional inhibitory concentration (∑FIC₅₀, ₉₀) of the interaction ofthapsigargin with OZ277, artemether or artesunate, against NF54 and K1 strains ofP. falciparum ranged from 0.9 to 1.4.

TA037549,10.1186/1756-3305-3-16,Synthetic sex pheromone attracts the leishmaniasis vector Lutzomyia longipalpisto experimental chicken sheds treated with insecticide.,"BACKGROUND: Current strategies for controlling American visceral leishmaniasis(AVL) have been unable to prevent the spread of the disease across Brazil. Withno effective vaccine and culling of infected dogs an unpopular and unsuccessfulalternative, new tools are urgently needed to manage populations of the sand flyvector, Lutzomyia longipalpis Lutz and Neiva (Diptera: Psychodidae). Here, wetest two potential strategies for improving L. longipalpis control using thesynthetic sand fly pheromone (+/-)-9-methylgermacrene-B: the first in conjunctionwith spraying of animal houses with insecticide, the second using coloured stickytraps. RESULTS: Addition of synthetic pheromone resulted in greater numbers ofmale and female sand flies being caught and killed at experimental chicken shedssprayed with insecticide, compared to pheromone-less controls. Furthermore, aten-fold increase in the amount of sex pheromone released from test shedsincreased the number of females attracted and subsequently killed. Treating shedswith insecticide alone resulted in a significant decrease in numbers of malesattracted to sheds (compared to pre-spraying levels), and a near significantdecrease in numbers of females. However, this effect was reversed throughaddition of synthetic pheromone at the time of insecticide spraying, leading toan increase in number of flies attracted post-treatment.In field trials ofcommercially available different coloured sticky traps, yellow traps caught moremales than blue traps when placed in chicken sheds. In addition, yellow trapsfitted with 10 pheromone lures caught significantly more males thanpheromone-less controls. However, while female sand flies showed a preference forboth blue and yellow pheromone traps sticky traps over white traps in thelaboratory, neither colour caught significant numbers of females in chickensheds, either with or without pheromone. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that syntheticpheromone could currently be most effectively deployed for sand fly controlthrough combination with existing insecticide spraying regimes. Development of astandalone pheromone trap remains a possibility, but such devices may require anadditional attractive host odour component to be fully effective.","Bray, Daniel P, Alves, Graziella B, Dorval, Maria E, Brazil, Reginaldo P, Hamilton, J Gc",2010,Parasites & vectors,2
TA037599,10.1155/2013/859085,Amelioration of prallethrin-induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity in rat bythe administration of Origanum majorana essential oil.,"This study was carried out to evaluate the adverse effects of exposure toprallethrin on oxidant/antioxidant status and liver dysfunction biomarkers andthe protective role of Origanum majorana essential oil (EO) in rat. Male ratswere divided into 4 groups: (i) received only olive oil (ii) treated with 64.0mg/kg body weight prallethrin (1/10 LD₅₀) in olive oil via oral route daily for28 days, (iii) treated with 64.0 mg/kg body weight prallethrin (1/10 LD₅₀) and EO(160 μL/kg b.wt.) in olive oil and (iv) received EO (160 μL/kg b.wt.) in oliveoil via oral route twice daily for 28 days. Prallethrin treatment caused decreasein body weight gain and increase in relative liver weight. There was asignificant increase in the activity of serum marker enzymes, aspartatetransaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. It caused increasein thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and reduction in the activities ofsuperoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase in liver.Consistent histological changes were found in the liver of prallethrin treatment.EO showed significant protection with the depletion of serum marker enzymes andreplenishment of antioxidant status and brought all the values to near normal,indicating the protective effect of EO. We can conclude that prallethrin causedoxidative damage and liver injury in male rat and co-administration of EOattenuated the toxic effect of prallethrin. These results demonstrate thatadministration of EO may be useful, easy, and economical to protect human againstpyrethroids toxic effects.","Mossa, Abdel-Tawab H, Refaie, Amel A, Ramadan, Amal, Bouajila, Jalloul",2013,BioMed research international,2
TA037607,10.1371/journal.pone.0014153,Natural proteasome inhibitor celastrol suppresses androgen-independent prostatecancer progression by modulating apoptotic proteins and NF-kappaB.,"BACKGROUND: Celastrol is a natural proteasome inhibitor that exhibits promisinganti-tumor effects in human malignancies, especially the androgen-independentprostate cancer (AIPC) with constitutive NF-κB activation. Celastrol inducesapoptosis by means of proteasome inhibition and suppresses prostate tumor growth.However, the detailed mechanism of action remains elusive. In the current study,we aim to test the hypothesis that celastrol suppresses AIPC progression viainhibiting the constitutive NF-κB activity as well as modulating the Bcl-2 familyproteins. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the efficacy of celastrolboth in vitro and in vivo, and evaluated the role of NF-κB in celastrol-mediatedAIPC regression. We found that celastrol inhibited cell proliferation in allthree AIPC cell lines (PC-3, DU145 and CL1), with IC₅₀ in the range of 1-2 µM.Celastrol also suppressed cell migration and invasion. Celastrol significantlyinduced apoptosis as evidenced by increased sub-G1 population, caspase activationand PARP cleavage. Moreover, celastrol promoted cleavage of the anti-apoptoticprotein Mcl-1 and activated the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa. In addition,celastrol rapidly blocked cytosolic IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation ofRelA. Likewise, celastrol inhibited the expression of multiple NF-κB target genesthat are involved in proliferation, invasion and anti-apoptosis. Celastrolsuppressed AIPC tumor progression by inhibiting proliferation, increasingapoptosis and decreasing angiogenesis, in PC-3 xenograft model in nude mouse.Furthermore, increased cellular IκBα and inhibited expression of various NF-κBtarget genes were observed in tumor tissues. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our datasuggest that, via targeting the proteasome, celastrol suppresses proliferation,invasion and angiogenesis by inducing the apoptotic machinery and attenuatingconstitutive NF-κB activity in AIPC both in vitro and in vivo. Celastrol as anactive ingredient of traditional herbal medicine could thus be developed as a newtherapeutic agent for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.","Dai, Yao, Desano, Jeffrey, Tang, Wenhua, Meng, Xiaojie, Meng, Yang, Burstein, Ezra, Lawrence, Theodore S, Xu, Liang",2010,PloS one,2
TA037620,10.12659/msm.882196,18α-Glycyrrhizin induces apoptosis and suppresses activation of rat hepaticstellate cells.,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the protectiveeffects of 18α Glycyrrhizin (GL) on rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) andhepatocytes in vivo and in vitro. MATERIAL/METHODS: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats wererandomly divided into 5 groups: normal control group, liver fibrosis group,high-dose 18α GL group (25 mg/ kg/d), intermediate-dose 18α GL group (12.5mg/kg/d) and low-dose 18α GL group (6.25 mg/ kg/d). The rat liver fibrosis modelwas induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). The expressions of alpha-smoothmuscle actin (αSMA) and NF-kappaB were determined by real-time PCR andimmunohistochemistry. RESULTS: 18αGL dose-dependently inhibited the CCl4-inducedliver fibrosis. There were significant differences in the mRNA and proteinexpressions of αSMA between the fibrosis group and 18α-GL treatment groups,suggesting that 18α GL can suppress the proliferation and activation of HSCs. FewHSCs were apoptotic in the portal area and fibrous septum in the liver fibrosisgroup. However, the double-color staining of a-SMA and TUNEL showed that 18α-GLtreatment groups increased HSC apoptosis. NF-kappaB was mainly found in thenucleus in the fibrosis group, while cytoplasmic expression of NF-kappaB wasnoted in the 18αGL groups. In the in vitro experiments, 18α GL promoted theproliferation of hepatocytes, but inhibited that of HSCs. HSCs were arrested inthe G2/M phase following 18α GL treatment and were largely apoptotic.CONCLUSIONS: 18α-GL can suppress the activation of HSCs and induce the apoptosisof HSCs by blocking the translocation of NF-kappaB into the nucleus, which playsan important role in the protective effect of 18α-GL on liver fibrosis.","Qu, Ying, Chen, Wei-Hua, Zong, Lei, Xu, Ming-Yi, Lu, Lun-Gen",2012,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental andclinical research,2
TA037631,10.1007/s10886-011-9906-7,Variation in herbivory-induced volatiles among cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)varieties has consequences for the attraction of carnivorous natural enemies.,"In response to herbivory by arthropods, plants emit herbivory-induced volatilesthat attract carnivorous enemies of the inducing herbivores. Here, we comparedthe attractiveness of eight cucumber varieties (Cucumis sativus L.) toPhytoseiulus persimilis predatory mites after infestation of the plants withherbivorous spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) under greenhouse conditions.Attractiveness differed considerably, with the most attractive variety attractingtwice as many predators as the least attractive variety. Chemical analysis of thevolatiles released by the infested plants revealed significant differences amongvarieties, both in quantity and quality of the emitted blends. Comparison of theattractiveness of the varieties with the amounts of volatiles emitted indicatedthat the quality (composition) of the blend is more important for attraction thanthe amount of volatiles emitted. The amount of (E)-β-ocimene, (E,E)-TMTT, and twoother, yet unidentified compounds correlated positively with the attraction ofpredatory mites. Quantities of four compounds negatively correlated withcarnivore attraction, among them methyl salicylate, which is known to attract thepredatory mite P. persimilis. The emission of methyl salicylate correlated withan unknown compound that had a negative correlation with carnivore attraction andhence could be masking the attractiveness of methyl salicylate. The results implythat the foraging success of natural enemies of pests can be enhanced by breedingfor crop varieties that release specific volatiles.","Kappers, Iris F, Hoogerbrugge, Hans, Bouwmeester, Harro J, Dicke, Marcel",2011,Journal of chemical ecology,2

TA037782,10.1371/journal.pone.0026677,Picomolar dichotomous activity of gnidimacrin against HIV-1.,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has offered a promising approach forcontrolling HIV-1 replication in infected individuals. However, with HARRT, HIV-1is suppressed rather than eradicated due to persistence of HIV-1 in latent viralreservoirs. Thus, purging the virus from latent reservoirs is an importantstrategy toward eradicating HIV-1 infection. In this study, we discovered thatthe daphnane diterpene gnidimacrin, which was previously reported to have potentanti-cancer cell activity, activated HIV-1 replication and killedpersistently-infected cells at picomolar concentrations. In addition to itspotential to purge HIV-1 from latently infected cells, gnidimacrin potentlyinhibited a panel of HIV-1 R5 virus infection of peripheral blood mononuclearcells (PBMCs) at an average concentration lower than 10 pM. In contrast,gnidimacrin only partially inhibited HIV-1 ×4 virus infection of PBMCs. Thestrong anti-HIV-1 R5 virus activity of gnidimacrin was correlated with its effecton down-regulation of the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5. The anti-R5 virus activity ofgnidimacrin was completely abrogated by a selective protein kinase C betainhibitor enzastaurin, which suggests that protein kinase C beta plays a key rolein the potent anti-HIV-1 activity of gnidimacrin in PBMCs. In summary, theseresults suggest that gnidimacrin could activate latent HIV-1, specifically killHIV-1 persistently infected cells, and inhibit R5 viruses at picomolarconcentrations.","Huang, Li, Ho, Phong, Yu, Jie, Zhu, Lei, Lee, Kuo-Hsiung, Chen, Chin-Ho",2011,PloS one,2

Hair cells are susceptible to death caused by aging, noise trauma, andototoxic drugs, including the aminoglycoside antibiotics and the antineoplasticagent cisplatin. Ototoxic drugs result in permanent hearing loss for over 500,000Americans annually. We showed previously that induction of heat shock proteins(HSPs) inhibits both aminoglycoside- and cisplatin-induced hair cell death inwhole-organ cultures of utricles from adult mice. In order to begin to translatethese findings into a clinical therapy aimed at inhibiting ototoxic drug-inducedhearing loss, we have now examined a pharmacological HSP inducer, celastrol.Celastrol induced upregulation of HSPs in utricles, and it provided significantprotection against aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death in vitro and in vivo.Moreover, celastrol inhibited hearing loss in mice receiving systemicaminoglycoside treatment. Our data indicate that the major heat shocktranscription factor HSF-1 is not required for celastrol-mediated protection.HSP32 (also called heme oxygenase-1, HO-1) is the primary mediator of theprotective effect of celastrol. HSP32/HO-1 inhibits pro-apoptotic c-JunN-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and hair cell death.

TA037856,10.3390/ijms13066757,Effects of 3β-acethyl tormentic acid (3ATA) on ABCC proteins activity.,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is considered the main cause of cancer chemotherapyfailure and patient relapse. The active drug efflux mediated by transporterproteins of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) family is the most investigatedmechanism leading to MDR. With the aim of inhibiting this transport andcircumventing MDR, a great amount of work has been dedicated to identifyingpharmacological inhibitors of specific ABC transporters. We recently showed that3β-acetyl tormentic acid (3ATA) had no effect on P-gp/ABCB1 activity. Herein, weshow that 3ATA strongly inhibited the activity of MRP1/ABCC1. In the B16/F10 andMa104 cell lines, this effect was either 20X higher or similar to that observedwith MK571, respectively. Nevertheless, the low inhibitory effect of 3ATA onA549, a cell line that expresses MRP1-5, suggests that it may not inhibit otherMRPs. The use of cells transfected with ABCC2, ABCC3 or ABCC4 showed that 3ATAwas also able to modulate these transporters, though with an inhibition ratiolower than that observed for MRP1/ABCC1. These data point to 3ATA as a new ABCCinhibitor and call attention to its potential use as a tool to investigate thefunction of MRP/ABCC proteins or as a co-adjuvant in the treatment of MDR tumors.","Da Graça Rocha, Gleice, Simões, Marisol, Oliveira, Rodrigo Rodrigues, Kaplan, Maria Auxiliadora Coelho, Gattass, Cerli Rocha",2012,International journal of molecular sciences,2
TA037892,10.7150/ijbs.4554,Oridonin up-regulates expression of P21 and induces autophagy and apoptosis inhuman prostate cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Oridonin (ORI) could inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosisin various cancer cell lines. However, the mechanism is not fully understood.METHODS: Human prostate cancer (HPC) cells were cultured in vitro and cellviability was detected by the CCK-8 assay. The ultrastructure changes wereobserved under transmission electron microscope (TEM). Chemical staining withacridine orange (AO), MDC or DAPI was used to detect acidic vesicular organelles(AVOs) and alternation of DNA. Expression of LC3 and P21 was detected by WesternBlot. Apoptotic rates and cell cycle arrest were detected by FACS. RESULTS: Ourstudy demonstrated that after ORI treatment, the proliferations of human prostatecancer (HPC) cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP were inhibited in a concentration andtime-dependent manner. ORI induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. A largenumber of autophagosomes with double-membrane structure and acidic vesicularorganelles (AVOs) were detected in the cytoplasm of HPC cells treated with ORIfor 24 hours. ORI resulted in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and recruitmentof LC3-II to the autophagosomal membranes. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine(3-MA) reduced AVOs formation and inhibited LC3-I to LC3-II conversion. At 48 h,DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation and disappearance of surface microvilliwere detected in ORI-treated cells. ORI induced a significant increase in thenumber of apoptotic cells (PC-3: 5.4% to 27.0%, LNCaP: 5.3% to 31.0%). Promotingautophagy by nutrient starvation increased cell viability, while inhibition ofautophagy by 3-MA promoted cell death. The expression of P21 was increased byORI, which could be completely reversed by the inhibition of autophagy.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that autophagy occurred before the onset ofapoptosis and protected cancer cells in ORI-treated HPC cells. P21 was involvedin ORI-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Our results provide an experimental basisfor understand the anti-tumor mechanism of ORI as treatment for prostate cancer.","Li, Xiang, Li, Xiang, Wang, Jiaxiong, Ye, Zaiyuan, Li, Ji-Cheng",2012,International journal of biological sciences,2

To date,the clinical use of medicinal agents has typically led to undesirable sideeffects. Numerous efforts have failed to create an effective and safe agent forthe treatment of gout. Lemnalol-an extract from Formosan soft coral-hasdocumented anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties. In the presentstudy, we attempt to examine the therapeutic effects of lemnalol onintra-articular monosodium urate (MSU)-induced gouty arthritis in rats. In thepresent study, we found that treatment with lemnalol (intramuscular [im]), butnot colchicine (oral [po]), significantly attenuated MUS-induced mechanicalallodynia, paw edema and knee swelling. Histomorphometric andimmunohistochemistry analysis revealed that MSU-induced inflammatory cellinfiltration, as well as the elevated expression of c-Fos and pro-inflammatoryproteins (inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2) observed insynovial tissue, were significantly inhibited by treatment with lemnalol. Weconclude that lemnalol may be a promising candidate for the development of a newtreatment for gout and other acute neutrophil-driven inflammatory diseases.","Lee, Hsin-Pai, Huang, Shi-Ying, Lin, Yen-You, Wang, Hui-Min, Jean, Yen-Hsuan, Wu, Shu-Fen, Duh, Chang-Yih, Wen, Zhi-Hong",2013,Marine drugs,2
TA037941,10.4161/cbt.22952,Parthenolide reduces the frequency of ABCB5-positive cells and clonogeniccapacity of melanoma cells from anchorage independent melanospheres.,"Growing evidence suggests that the cancer stem cell phenotype in melanoma isdynamically regulated. Therefore, effective therapies have to targetsimultaneously bulk tumor cells and melanoma stem-like cells. The aim of thepresent study was to investigate the effects of parthenolide on heterogeneouscancer cell populations from anchorage-independent melanospheres. Cells derivedfrom nodular melanoma specimens were grown under serum-free sphere-formingconditions. The effects of parthenolide on cellular viability, immunophenotypeand self-renewing capacity were assessed with cells from dissociatedmelanospheres. Its penetration capacity was evaluated with intact melanospheres.In melanoma cells that survived treatment with parthenolide, a differentimmunophenotype than that in untreated control was found. The frequency of cellsexpressing the ABCB5 transporter was markedly reduced. Most importantly, melanomacells that survived parthenolide treatment lost their self-renewing capacity.Significantly lower influence of drug on cellular viability and frequency ofABCB5-positive cells was observed in intact melanospheres. The potential clinicalsignificance of our findings is based on the ability of parthenolide to affectboth bulk and melanoma stem-like cells with clonogenic capacity and highexpression of the ABCB5 transporter. Its low penetration capacity, however, maylimit its action to easily accessible melanoma cells, either circulating in theblood or those in the vicinity to blood vessels within the tumor. Because oflimited penetration capacity of parthenolide, this drug should be furtherexplored as a part of multimodal therapies rather than as a stand-alonetherapeutic agent.","Czyz, Malgorzata, Koprowska, Kamila, Sztiller-Sikorska, Malgorzata",2013,Cancer biology & therapy,2

The arrhythmia model was established inisolated rat hearts by regional ischemia, and myocardial infarction model byischemia/reperfusion. Microtubule structure was immunohistochemically measured.The potential mechanisms were studied by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS),activities of oxidative enzymes, intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i) ) and Ca(2+) transients by using fluorometric determination,spectrophotometric assays and Fura-2-AM and Fluo-3-AM, respectively. Theexpression and activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) wasalso examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot andpyruvate/Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-coupled reaction. Our data showed thatTaxol (0.1, 0.3 and 1 μM) effectively reduced the number of ventricular prematurebeats and the incidence and duration of ventricular tachycardia. The infarct sizewas also significantly reduced by Taxol (1 μM). At the same time, Taxol preservedthe microtubule structure, increased the activity of mitochondrial electrontransport chain complexes I and III, reduced ROS levels, decreased the rise in[Ca(2+)](i) and preserved the amplitude and decay times of Ca(2+) transientsduring ischemia. In addition, SERCA2a activity was preserved by Taxol duringischemia. In summary, Taxol prevents ischemic ventricular arrhythmias likelythrough ameliorating abnormal calcium homeostasis and decreasing the level ofROS. This study presents evidence that Taxol may be a potential novel therapy forischemic ventricular arrhythmias.","Xiao, Junjie, Cao, Huaming, Liang, Dandan, Liu, Ying, Zhang, Hong, Zhao, Hong, Liu, Yi, Li, Jun, Yan, Biao, Peng, Luying, Zhou, Zhaonian, Chen, Yi-Han",2011,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2

We identified their constituents using gaschromatography-mass spectrometry, and evaluated the responses of male H. cuneaantennae to the compounds using gas chromatography-flame ionization detectioncoupled with electroantennographic detection. Eleven VOC constituents were foundto stimulate antennae of male H. cunea moths: β-ocimene, hexanal, cis-3-hexenal,limonene, trans-2-hexenal, cyclohexanone, cis-2-penten-1-ol,6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, trans-3-hexen-1-ol, and2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanol. Nine of these chemicals were released by intact,mechanically-damaged, and herbivore-damaged leaves, while cis-2-penten-1-ol wasreleased only by intact and mechanically-damaged leaves and β-ocimene wasreleased only by herbivore-damaged leaves. Results from wind tunnel experimentsconducted with volatile components indicated that male moths were significantlymore attracted to herbivory-induced volatiles than the solvent control.Furthermore, male moths' attraction to a sex pheromone lure was increased byherbivory-induced compounds and β-ocimene, but reduced by cis-2-penten-1-ol. Aproof long-range field trapping experiment showed that the efficiency of sexpheromone lures in trapping male moths was increased by β-ocimene and reduced bycis-2-penten-1-ol.","Tang, Rui, Zhang, Jin Ping, Zhang, Zhong Ning",2012,PloS one,2
TA038000,10.1371/journal.pone.0053168,The sesquiterpene lactone dehydroleucodine triggers senescence and apoptosis inassociation with accumulation of DNA damage markers.,"Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are plant-derived compounds that display anti-cancereffects. Some SLs derivatives have a marked killing effect on cancer cells andhave therefore reached clinical trials. Little is known regarding the mechanismof action of SLs. We studied the responses of human cancer cells exposed tovarious concentrations of dehydroleucodine (DhL), a SL of the guaianolide groupisolated and purified from Artemisia douglasiana (Besser), a medicinal herb thatis commonly used in Argentina. We demonstrate for the first time that treatmentof cancer cells with DhL, promotes the accumulation of DNA damage markers such asphosphorylation of ATM and focal organization of γH2AX and 53BP1. Thisaccumulation triggers cell senescence or apoptosis depending on the concentrationof the DhL delivered to cells. Transient DhL treatment also induces markedaccumulation of senescent cells. Our findings help elucidate the mechanismwhereby DhL triggers cell cycle arrest and cell death and provide a basis forfurther exploration of the effects of DhL in in vivo cancer treatment models.","Costantino, Valeria V, Mansilla, Sabrina F, Speroni, Juliana, Amaya, Celina, Cuello-Carrión, Darío, Ciocca, Daniel R, Priestap, Horacio A, Barbieri, Manuel A, Gottifredi, Vanesa, Lopez, Luis A",2013,PloS one,2
TA038005,10.1371/journal.pone.0080859,Protective effect of ginsenoside Rb1 against intestinal ischemia-reperfusioninduced acute renal injury in mice.,"Ginsenoside Rb1 (RB1), the most clinically effective constituent of ginseng,possesses a variety of biological activities. The objectives of this study wereto investigate the protective effects of RB1 and its underlying mechanism onrenal injury induced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR) in mice. RB1 wasadministered prior to inducing IIR achieved by occluding the superior mesentericartery for 45 min followed by 120 min of reperfusion. All-trans-retinoic acid(ATRA) was used as an inhibitor of NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) signaling. Adultmale C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into six groups: (1) sham group, (2) IIRgroup, (3) RB1 group, (4) sham + ATRA group, (5) IIR + ATRA group, and (6) RB1 +ATRA group. Intestinal histology and pathological injury score were observed.Intestinal mucosal injury was also evaluated by measuring serum diamine oxidase(DAO). Renal injury induced by IIR was characterized by increased levels ofhistological severity score, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr)and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), which was accompanied withelevated renal TUNEL-positive cells and the Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio. RB1significantly reduced renal injury and apoptosis as compared with IIR group,which was reversed by ATRA treatment. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotanalysis demonstrated that RB1 significantly upregulated the protein expressionof heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and Nrf2, which were attenuated by ATRA treatment.Taken together, these results suggest that the protective effects of RB1pretreatment against renal injury induced by IIR are associated with activationof the Nrf2/ anti-oxidant response element (ARE) pathway.","Sun, Qian, Meng, Qing-tao, Jiang, Ying, Liu, Hui-min, Lei, Shao-qing, Su, Wa-ting, Duan, Wei-na, Wu, Yang, Xia, Zheng-yuan, Xia, Zhong-yuan",2013,PloS one,2
TA038050,10.1038/ncomms1680,An intrinsically labile α-helix abutting the BCL9-binding site of β-catenin isrequired for its inhibition by carnosic acid.,"Wnt/β-catenin signalling controls development and tissue homeostasis. Moreover,activated β-catenin can be oncogenic and, notably, drives colorectal cancer.Inhibiting oncogenic β-catenin has proven a formidable challenge. Here we designa screen for small-molecule inhibitors of β-catenin's binding to its cofactorBCL9, and discover five related natural compounds, including carnosic acid fromrosemary, which attenuates transcriptional β-catenin outputs in colorectal cancercells. Evidence from NMR and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrates that thecarnosic acid response requires an intrinsically labile α-helix (H1)amino-terminally abutting the BCL9-binding site in β-catenin. Similarly, incolorectal cancer cells with hyperactive β-catenin signalling, carnosic acidtargets predominantly the transcriptionally active ('oncogenic') form ofβ-catenin for proteasomal degradation in an H1-dependent manner. Hence, H1 is an'Achilles' Heel' of β-catenin, which can be exploited for destabilization ofoncogenic β-catenin by small molecules, providing proof-of-principle for a newstrategy for developing direct inhibitors of oncogenic β-catenin.","de la Roche, Marc, Rutherford, Trevor J, Gupta, Deepti, Veprintsev, Dmitry B, Saxty, Barbara, Freund, Stefan M, Bienz, Mariann",2012,Nature communications,2
TA038105,10.1186/1471-2164-12-391,Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum is associated with an alteredtemporal pattern of transcription.,"BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria has emergedin Western Cambodia. This is a major threat to global plans to control andeliminate malaria as the artemisinins are a key component of antimalarialtreatment throughout the world. To identify key features associated with thedelayed parasite clearance phenotype, we employed DNA microarrays to profile thephysiological gene expression pattern of the resistant isolates. RESULTS: In thering and trophozoite stages, we observed reduced expression of many basicmetabolic and cellular pathways which suggests a slower growth and maturation ofthese parasites during the first half of the asexual intraerythrocyticdevelopmental cycle (IDC). In the schizont stage, there is an increasedexpression of essentially all functionalities associated with protein metabolismwhich indicates the prolonged and thus increased capacity of protein synthesisduring the second half of the resistant parasite IDC. This modulation of the P.falciparum intraerythrocytic transcriptome may result from differentialexpression of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors or chromatinremodeling associated proteins. In addition, there is a unique and uniform copynumber variation pattern in the Cambodian parasites which may represent anunderlying genetic background that contributes to the resistance phenotype.CONCLUSIONS: The decreased metabolic activities in the ring stages are consistentwith previous suggestions of higher resilience of the early developmental stagesto artemisinin. Moreover, the increased capacity of protein synthesis and proteinturnover in the schizont stage may contribute to artemisinin resistance bycounteracting the protein damage caused by the oxidative stress and/or proteinalkylation effect of this drug. This study reports the first globaltranscriptional survey of artemisinin resistant parasites and provides insight tothe complexities of the molecular basis of pathogens with drug resistancephenotypes in vivo.","Mok, Sachel, Imwong, Mallika, Mackinnon, Margaret J, Sim, Joan, Ramadoss, Ramya, Yi, Poravuth, Mayxay, Mayfong, Chotivanich, Kesinee, Liong, Kek-Yee, Russell, Bruce, Socheat, Duong, Newton, Paul N, Day, Nicholas P J, White, Nicholas J, Preiser, Peter R, Nosten, François, Dondorp, Arjen M, Bozdech, Zbynek",2011,BMC genomics,2
TA038141,10.1186/1472-6882-13-152,The protective effect of geniposide on human neuroblastoma cells in the presenceof formaldehyde.,"BACKGROUND: Formaldehyde can induce misfolding and aggregation of Tau protein andβ amyloid protein, which are characteristic pathological features of Alzheimer'sdisease (AD). An increase in endogenous formaldehyde concentration in the brainis closely related to dementia in aging people. Therefore, the discovery ofeffective drugs to counteract the adverse impact of formaldehyde on neuronalcells is beneficial for the development of appropriate treatments forage-associated cognitive decline. METHODS: In this study, we assessed theneuroprotective properties of TongLuoJiuNao (TLJN), a traditional Chinesemedicine preparation, against formaldehyde stress in human neuroblastoma cells(SH-SY5Y cell line). The effect of TLJN and its main ingredients (geniposide andginsenoside Rg1) on cell viability, apoptosis, intracellular antioxidant activityand the expression of apoptotic-related genes in the presence of formaldehydewere monitored. RESULTS: Cell counting studies showed that in the presence ofTLJN, the viability of formaldehyde-treated SH-SY5Y cells significantlyrecovered. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that the morphology offormaldehyde-injured cells was rescued by TLJN and geniposide, an effectiveingredient of TLJN. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of geniposide onformaldehyde-induced apoptosis was dose-dependent. The activity of intracellularantioxidants (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) increased, as didmRNA and protein levels of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 after the addition ofgeniposide. In contrast, the expression of the apoptotic-related gene - P53,apoptotic executer - caspase 3 and apoptotic initiator - caspase 9 weredownregulated after geniposide treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate thatgeniposide can protect SH-SY5Y cells against formaldehyde stress throughmodulating the expression of Bcl-2, P53, caspase 3 and caspase 9, and byincreasing the activity of intracellular superoxide dismutase and glutathioneperoxidase.","Sun, Ping, Chen, Jin-yan, Li, Jiao, Sun, Meng-ru, Mo, Wei-chuan, Liu, Kai-li, Meng, Yan-yan, Liu, Ying, Wang, Feng, He, Rong-qiao, Hua, Qian",2013,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,2

Using an intranasalinstillation model in mice, we found that acute SG exposure specifically inducedapoptosis of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the olfactory epithelium.Dose-response analysis revealed that the no-effect and lowest-effect levels at 24hr postinstillation (PI) were 5 and 25 microg/kg body weight (bw) SG,respectively, with severity increasing with dose. Apoptosis of OSNs wasidentified using immunohistochemistry for caspase-3 expression, electronmicroscopy for ultrastructural cellular morphology, and real-time polymerasechain reaction for elevated expression of the proapoptotic genes Fas, FasL,p75NGFR, p53, Bax, caspase-3, and CAD. Time-course studies with a singleinstillation of SG (500 microg/kg bw) indicated that maximum atrophy of theolfactory epithelium occurred at 3 days PI. Exposure to lower doses (100microg/kg bw) for 5 consecutive days resulted in similar atrophy and apoptosis,suggesting that in the short term, these effects are cumulative. SG also inducedan acute, neutrophilic rhinitis as early as 24 hr PI. Elevated mRNA expressionfor the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6(IL-6) , and IL-1 and the chemokine macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2)were detected at 24 hr PI in both the ethmoid turbinates of the nasal airways andthe adjacent olfactory bulb of the brain. Marked atrophy of the olfactory nerveand glomerular layers of the olfactory bulb was also detectable by 7 days PIalong with mild neutrophilic encephalitis.

The combination of low-dose chemotherapy and anti-angiogenicinhibitors suppresses growth of experimental tumors more effectively thanconventional therapy or anti-angiogenic agent alone. The present study wasdesigned to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose gemcitabine combined withginsenoside Rg3 on angiogenesis and growth of established Lewis lung carcinoma inmice. METHODS: C57L/6 mice implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma were randomizedinto the control, ginsenoside Rg3, gemcitabine and combination group. The qualityof life and survival of mice were recorded. Tumor volume, inhibitive rate andnecrosis rate were estimated. Necrosis of tumor and signals of blood flow as wellas dynamic parameters of arterial blood flow in tumors such as peak systolicvelocity (PSV) and resistive index (RI) were detected by color Dopplerultrasound. In addition, expression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor(VEGF) and CD31 were observed by immunohistochemstry, and microvessel density(MVD) of the tumor tissues was assessed by CD31 immunohistochemical analysis.RESULTS: Quality of life of mice in the ginsenoside Rg3 and combination groupwere better than in the control and gemcitabine group. Combined therapy withginsenoside Rg3 and gemcitabine not only enhanced efficacy on suppression oftumor growth and prolongation of the survival, but also increased necrosis rateof tumor significantly. In addition, the combination treatment could obviouslydecrease VEGF expression and MVD as well as signals of blood flow and PSV intumors. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside Rg3 combined with gemcitabine may significantlyinhibit angiogenesis and growth of lung cancer and improve survival and qualityof life of tumor-bearing mice.

A total of 49 odor-activecompounds (43 in FAT and 42 in DAT) with flavor dilution (FD) factors rangingfrom 1 to 6561 were identified, with eucalyptol exhibiting the highest FD factorof 6561. Odorants with FD factors ≥ 27 were quantitated, and 23 and 20 compoundsin FAT and DAT, respectively, with odor activity value ≥ 1 were determined as keyodorants. Recombination and omission experiment further indicated that(E)-2-dodecenal, geranial, octanal, (E)-2-octenal, (E)-2-decenal, and eucalyptolcontributed significantly to the overall aroma profile of FAT. After drying ofFAT, the concentrations of aldehydes decreased significantly, whereas those ofterpene hydrocarbons increased. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that26 FAT and 23 DAT odorants were biomarker compounds.","Liang, Miao, Wu, Yajian, Wang, Rui, Zhang, Zhimin, Xin, Runhu, Liu, Yuping",2024,Food chemistry: X,2

The conditions of UAE were 50 mL/g LSR, 600W of ultrasonic power, and30% water content with 40°C for 1 min to obtain the highest bioactive compoundsand protein contents. The conditions of MAE were 40 mL/g LSR, 400W of microwavepower with 30% water content for 3 min to reach the highest contents ofbiological compounds. The conditions of EAE were 30 mL/g of LSR, 20 U/g of enzymeconcentration with L-Gly-Na molar ratio at 2:4:1, and 40% water content for 60min to acquire the highest bioactive compound contents. Scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) is employed to analyze the surface of Bacopa monnieri leavesbefore and after extraction. Comparing seven extraction methods was conducted tofind the most favorable ones. The result showed that the UMEAE method was themost effective way to exploit the compounds.

One of the most abundant bacterial terpenoids is the volatile odorant2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB), partially responsible for the earthy smell of soiland musty taste of contaminated water. Many bacterial 2-MIB biosynthetic geneclusters were thought to encode a conserved transcription factor, named EshA inthe model soil bacterium Streptomyces griseus. Here, we revise the function ofEshA, now referred to as Sg Enc, and show that it is a Family 2B encapsulin shellprotein. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we find that Sg Enc forms an icosahedralprotein shell and encapsulates 2-methylisoborneol synthase (2-MIBS) as a cargoprotein. Sg Enc contains a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) binding domain(CBD)-fold insertion and a unique metal-binding domain, both displayed on theshell exterior. We show that Sg Enc CBDs do not bind cAMP. We find that 2-MIBScargo loading is mediated by an N-terminal disordered cargo-loading domain andthat 2-MIBS activity and Sg Enc shell structure are not modulated by cAMP. Ourwork redefines the function of EshA and establishes Family 2B encapsulins ascargo-loaded protein nanocompartments involved in secondary metabolitebiosynthesis.","Andreas, Michael P, Giessen, Tobias W",2024,Nature communications,2
TA038614,10.1128/msphere.00192-24,Biosynthetic gene clusters from uncultivated soil bacteria of the Atacama Desert.,"Soil microorganisms mediate several biological processes through the secretion ofnatural products synthesized in specialized metabolic pathways, yet functionalcharacterization in ecological contexts remains challenging. Usingculture-independent metagenomic analyses of microbial DNA derived directly fromsoil samples, we examined the potential of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) fromsix bacterial communities distributed along an altitudinal gradient of the AndesMountains in the Atacama Desert. We mined 38 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)and identified 168 BGCs. Results indicated that most predicted BGCs wereclassified as non-ribosomal-peptides (NRP), post-translational modified peptides(RiPP), and terpenes, which were mainly identified in genomes of species fromAcidobacteriota and Proteobacteria phyla. Based on BGC composition according totypes of core biosynthetic genes, six clusters of MAGs were observed, three ofthem with predominance for a single phylum, of which two also showed specificityto a single sampling site. Comparative analyses of accessory genes in BGCs showedassociations between membrane transporters and other protein domains involved inspecialized metabolism with classes of biosynthetic cores, such asresistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) multidrug efflux pumps with RiPPs andthe iron-dependent transporter TonB with terpenes. Our findings increaseknowledge regarding the biosynthetic potential of uncultured bacteria inhabitingpristine locations from one of the oldest and driest nonpolar deserts onEarth.IMPORTANCEMuch of what we know about specialized metabolites in the AtacamaDesert, including Andean ecosystems, comes from isolated microorganisms intendedfor drug development and natural product discovery. To complement research on themetabolic potential of microbes in extreme environments, comparative analyses onfunctional annotations of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from uncultivatedbacterial genomes were carried out. Results indicated that in general, BGCsencode for structurally unique metabolites and that metagenome-assembled genomesdid not show an obvious relationship between the composition of their corebiosynthetic potential and taxonomy or geographic distribution. Nevertheless,some members of Acidobacteriota showed a phylogenetic relationship with specificmetabolic traits and a few members of Proteobacteria and Desulfobacterotaexhibited niche adaptations.

Recent scientific investigations have analyzed the chemical constituentsand seasonal dynamics of essential oils (EO) from various Piper L. species,highlighting the need to elucidate their chemical-ecological interactions. Thisstudy aims to expand the chemical-ecological knowledge of this important taxon inneotropical forests, using P. mollicomum as a model. The methodologies employedinclude the collection of plant material, EO extraction by hydrodistillation,analysis of EO by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gaschromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID), recording the frequency ofvisits by potential pollinators and microclimatic variables, and by conductingcalculations of chemodiversity and chemophenetic indices. Chemical analysesindicated that the diversity of EO and environmental factors are linked to theactivities of potential pollinators. In the Tijuca Forest, P. mollicomum revealedsignificant interactions between its volatile constituents and microclimaticvariables, showing that the chemodiversity of the leaves and reproductive organscorrelates with pollinator visitation. Additionally, a notable difference inchemical evenness was observed between these vegetative structures.

TA038709,10.1186/s12870-024-05265-4,Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals genes involved in trichome developmentand metabolism in tobacco.,"BACKGROUND: The glandular trichomes of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) canefficiently produce secondary metabolites. They act as natural bioreactors, andtheir natural products function to protect plants against insect-pests andpathogens and are also components of industrial chemicals. To clarify themolecular mechanisms of tobacco glandular trichome development and secondarymetabolic regulation, glandular trichomes and glandless trichomes, as well asother different developmental tissues, were used for RNA sequencing and analysis.RESULTS: By comparing glandless and glandular trichomes with other tissues, weobtained differentially expressed genes. They were obviously enriched in KEGGpathways, such as cutin, suberine, and wax biosynthesis, flavonoid andisoflavonoid biosynthesis, terpenoid biosynthesis, and plant-pathogeninteraction. In particular, the expression levels of genes related to theterpenoid, flavonoid, and wax biosynthesis pathway mainly showed down-regulationin glandless trichomes, implying that they lack the capability to synthesizecertain exudate compounds. Among the differentially expressed genes, 234transcription factors were found, including AP2-ERFs, MYBs, bHLHs, WRKYs,Homeoboxes (HD-ZIP), and C2H2-ZFs. These transcription factor and genes thathighly expressed in trichomes or specially expressed in GT or GLT. Following theoverexpression of R2R3-MYB transcription factor Nitab4.5_0011760g0030.1 intobacco, an increase in the number of branched glandular trichomes was observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide comprehensive gene expression information at thetranscriptional level and an understanding of the regulatory pathways involved inglandular trichome development and secondary metabolism.","Chen, Mingli, Li, Zhiyuan, He, Xinxi, Zhang, Zhe, Wang, Dong, Cui, Luying, Xie, Minmin, Zhao, Zeyu, Sun, Quan, Wang, Dahai, Dai, Jiameng, Gong, Daping",2024,BMC plant biology,2

Here, wesynthesize 20 atmospherically relevant AAHPs through liquid-phase ozonolysis, inwhich two types of monoterpene-derived SCIs from either α-pinene or 3-carene arescavenged by 10 different carboxylic acids to form AAHPs with diverse structures.These AAHPs are identified individually by liquid chromatography coupled withhigh-resolution mass spectrometry. AAHPs were previously thought to decomposequickly in an aqueous environment such as cloud droplets, but we demonstrate herethat AAHPs hydrolysis rates are highly compound-dependent with rate constantsdiffering by 2 orders of magnitude. In contrast, the aqueous-phase formation rateconstants between SCI and various carboxylic acids vary only within a factor of2-3. Finally, we identified two of the 20 synthesized AAHPs in α-pinene SOA andtwo in 3-carene SOA, contributing ∼0.3% to the total SOA mass.

Therefore, the primary focus of this research was toassess the overall limonoid content and isolate limonoids from Adalia lemon(Citrus limon L.) peels for their potential use as antioxidants and anti-diabeticagents. The levels of limonoid aglycones in the C. limon peel extract werequantified through a colorimetric assay, revealing a concentration of16.53 ± 0.93 mg/L limonin equivalent. Furthermore, the total concentration oflimonoid glucosides was determined to be 54.38 ± 1.02 mg/L.

The efficacy of thelimonoids-rich extract and the five isolated compounds was evaluated at threedifferent concentrations (50, 100, and 200 µg/mL). It was found that bothobacunone 17-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and limonin 17-O-β-D-glucopyranoside possessedthe highest antioxidant, free radical scavenging, and anti-diabetic activities,followed by deacetylnomilin, and then the limonoids-rich extract. The moleculardynamic simulations were conducted to predict the behavior of the isolatedcompounds upon binding to the protein's active site, as well as their interactionand stability. The results revealed that limonin 17-O-β-D-glucopyranoside boundto the protein complex system exhibited a relatively more stable conformationthan the Apo system. The analysis of Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA), inconjunction with the data obtained from Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD),Root-Mean-Square Fluctuation (RMSF), and Radius of Gyration (ROG) computations,provided further evidence that the limonin 17-O-β-D-glucopyranoside complexsystem remained stable within the catalytic domain binding site of the humanpancreatic alpha-amylase (HPA)-receptor.

Candida albicans is the most common cause ofsuperficial fungal infections in humans. In this study, plumieride, one of themajor iridoids from Plumeria obtusa L. leaves, was isolated and investigated forits potential against Candida albicans (CA)-induced dermatitis in mice. qRT-PCRwas done to assess the impact of plumieride on the expression of the majorvirulence genes of CA. Five groups (n = 7) of adult male BALB/c mice werecategorized into: group I: non-infected mice; group II: mice infectedintradermally with 10(7)-10(8) CFU/mL of CA; group III: CA-infected mice treatedwith standard fluconazole (50 mg/kg bwt.); group IV and V: CA-infected micetreated with plumieride (25- and 50 mg/kg. bwt., respectively). All thetreatments were subcutaneously injected once a day for 3 days. Skin samples werecollected on the 4th day post-inoculation to perform pathological, microbial, andmolecular studies. The results of the in vitro study proved that plumieride hasbetter antifungal activity than fluconazole, manifested by a wider zone ofinhibition and a lower MIC. Plumieride also downregulated the expression of CAvirulence genes (ALS1, Plb1, and Hyr1). CA-infected mice showed extensivedermatitis, confirmed by strong iNOS, TNF-α, IL-1β, and NF-κB genes or immuneexpressions. Whereas the treatment of CA-infected mice with plumieridesignificantly reduced the microscopic skin lesions and modulated the expressionof all measured proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory markers in adose-dependent manner.

Medicinal plants, e.g., Lavandula dentata L., are rich inphenolic compounds and may provide neuroprotective and anti-inflammatorybenefits. However, limited research evaluates their effectiveness in modulatingneuroinflammation and histopathological changes in epilepsy models. Therefore,the current study hypothesized that treating Lavandula dentata L. extract oressential oils may reduce neuroinflammatory responses and mitigatehistopathological changes in the brain, providing a natural alternative oradjunct therapy for epilepsy management. Methods: Five groups of male Wistar ratswere used: control, pilocarpine-treated epileptic, valproic acid (VPA-treatedepileptic), L. dentata extract, and essential oils. Numerous electrolyte levels,monoamine levels, neurotransmitter levels, and the mRNA expression of specificgate channel subtypes were evaluated in homogenate brain tissue. Additionally,histological changes in various brain regions were investigated. Results: Theinvestigation revealed that the extract and essential oils obtained from L.dentata L. exhibited the ability to improve the modulation of electrolytes andions across voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Furthermore, it was revealedthat they could decrease neuronal excitability by facilitating repolarization.Moreover, L. dentata's oil and ethanol extract re-balances T-reg/Th-17 cytokines,restoring the pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg markers, e.g., FOXP3 andCTLA-4, to their normal level. Conclusions: The present work confirms that theextract and essential oils of L. dentata L. have different activities toameliorate the progression of histopathological alterations.

The equilibrium partitioning coefficient estimated according toequilibrium partitioning theory shows that the measured SVOC products distributemore into the SOA phase as the temperature decreases from 20 to 10 and 0 °C andfor most products as the RH increases from <2 to 78%. The temperature dependencyof the saturation vapor pressure (above an assumed liquid state), derived fromthe partitioning method, also allows for a direct way to obtain enthalpy ofvaporization for the detected species without accessibility of authenticstandards of the pure substances. This method can provide physical properties,beneficial for, e.g., atmospheric modeling, of complex multifunctional oxidationproducts.","Li, Linjie, Thomsen, Ditte, Wu, Cheng, Priestley, Michael, Iversen, Emil Mark, Tygesen Sko Nager, Jane, Luo, Yuanyuan, Ehn, Mikael, Roldin, Pontus, Pedersen, Henrik B, Bilde, Merete, Glasius, Marianne, Hallquist, Mattias",2024,The journal of physical chemistry.

This study aims to evaluate the potentialtherapeutic effects of MON in the mouse model of chronic asthma. METHODS: Anovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic mouse model was established to evaluate thetherapeutic effect of MON at different doses (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg). Thepotential involvement of protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)pathway in the effect of MON was investigated by the administration of an AKTactivator SC79. Histological changes in pulmonary tissues were examined byhematoxylin and eosin staining. The profiles of inflammatory cytokines(interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α) inbronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and OVA-specific IgE in blood samples wereanalyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The oxidative stress inthe lung tissues was determined by measuring malondialdehyde level. Thephosphorylation activation of AKT and NF-κB was examined by immunoblotting in thelung tissues. RESULTS: MON treatment suppressed the infiltration of inflammatorycells in the airways of OVA-induced asthma mice and reduced the thickness of thebronchial wall and smooth muscle layer in a dose-dependent manner. MON treatmentalso reduced the levels of OVA-specific IgE in serum and cytokines in BALF inasthma-induced mice, and attenuated the oxidative stress in the lung tissues. OVAinduced the phosphorylation of AKT and NF-κB proteins in the lung tissues ofasthmatic mice, which was significantly suppressed by MON treatment. Theco-administration of AKT activator SC79 impaired the therapeutic effect of MON onasthma-induced mice. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated the potential therapeuticeffect of MON on asthmatic mouse model, suggesting that MON attenuated theinflammatory and oxidative damages in ling tissues by dampening the AKT/NF-κBsignaling pathway.","Guo, Xin, Sun, Wenjie, Zhang, Bingbing",2024,International archives of allergy and immunology,2
TA039249,10.1038/s41598-024-71518-9,Investigation of genes involved in scent and color production in Rosa damascenaMill.,"Rosa damascena Mill., commonly known as the King Flower, is a fragrant andimportant species of the Rosaceae family. It is widely used in the perfumery andpharmaceutical industries. The scent and color of the flowers are significantcharacteristics of this ornamental plant. This study aimed to investigate therelative expression of MYB1, CCD1, FLS, PAL, CER1, GT1, ANS and PAR genes undertwo growth stages (S1 and S2) in two morphs. The CCD1 gene pathway is highlycorrelated with the biosynthesis of volatile compounds. The results showed thatthe overexpression of MYB1, one of the important transcription factors in theproduction of fragrance and color, in the Hot pink morph of sample S2 increasedthe expression of PAR, PAL, FLS, RhGT1, CCD1, ANS, CER1, and GGPPS. The methyljasmonate (MeJA) stimulant had a positive and cumulative effect on geneexpression in most genes, such as FLS in ACC.26 of the S2 sample, RhGT1, MYB1,CCD1, PAR, ANS, CER1, and PAL in ACC.1. To further study, a comprehensiveanalysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between the principalvolatile compounds and colors. Our data suggest that the rose with pink flowershad a higher accumulation content of flavonoids and anthocyanin. To separateessential oil compounds, GC/MS analysis identified 26 compounds in four samples.The highest amount of geraniol, one of the main components of damask rose, wasfound in the Hot pink flower, 23.54%, under the influence of the MeJA hormone.","Kiani, Hoda Sadat, Noudehi, Manijeh Sabokdast, Shokrpour, Majid, Zargar, Meisam, Naghavi, Mohammad Reza",2024,Scientific reports,2
TA039279,10.3390/molecules29194682,Essential Oil-Based Soap with Clove and Oregano: A Promising Antifungal andAntibacterial Alternative against Multidrug-Resistant Microorganisms.,"The transmission of microorganisms via hands is a critical factor inhealthcare-associated infections (HAIs), underscoring the importance of rigoroushand hygiene. The rise of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, driven in partby the overuse of antibiotics in clinical medicine, presents a significant globalhealth challenge. Antimicrobial soaps, although commonly used, may exacerbatebacterial resistance and disrupt skin microbiota, posing additional health risksand environmental hazards. Essential oils, with their broad-spectrumantimicrobial properties, offer a promising alternative. This study evaluates theantimicrobial activity of essential oils against various bacterial and fungalstrains, including multidrug-resistant isolates. Using a range of in vitro and invivo antimicrobial assays, including minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC),minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimal fungicidal concentration(MFC), the essential oils were tested against a broad spectrum of pathogens.Additionally, the chemical composition of the oils was analyzed in detail usinggas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CG-MS). Clove, oregano, and thyme oilsdemonstrated potent inhibition of all tested ATCC bacterial strains, with MICvalues ranging from 3.125 to 50 μL/mL. These oils also showed significantactivity against multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosastrains. Notably, clove oil exhibited remarkable efficacy against fungal strainssuch as Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum, with MIC values as low as1.56 μL/mL. Synergy tests revealed that combinations of clove, oregano, and thymeoils yielded significantly lower MIC values than individual oils, indicatingadditive or synergistic effects. The formulation of a soap incorporating cloveand oregano oils demonstrated efficacy comparable to synthetic antiseptics invivo. These findings highlight the exceptional antimicrobial potential ofessential oils, mainly clove and oregano, against resistant microorganisms,offering a viable alternative to conventional antimicrobial agents.","Cruz, Ana Paula Merino, Nishimura, Felipe Garcia, Santos, Vinícius Cristian Oti Dos, Steling, Eliana Guedes, Von Zeska Kress, Marcia Regina, Marins, Mozart, Fachin, Ana Lucia",2024,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

This study explores thepotential of salt-tolerant endophytes to mitigate the adverse effects of soilsalinization, emphasizing their impact on the development and resistance ofArachis hypogaea L. (peanuts). METHODS: The diversity of culturable plantendophytic bacteria associated with Miscanthus lutarioriparius was investigated.The study focused on the effects of Bacillus tequilensis, Staphylococcusepidermidis, and Bacillus siamensis on the development and germination of A.hypogaea seeds in pots subjected to high NaCl concentrations (200 mM L(-1)).RESULTS: Under elevated NaCl concentrations, the inoculation of endophytessignificantly (p < 0.05) enhanced seedling germination and increased theactivities of enzymes such as Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and polyphenoloxidase, while reducing malondialdehyde and peroxidase levels. Additionally,endophyte inoculation resulted in increased root surface area, plant height,biomass contents, and leaf surface area of peanuts under NaCl stress.Transcriptome data revealed an augmented defense and resistance response inducedby the applied endophyte (B. tequilensis, S. epidermidis, and B. siamensis)strain, including upregulation of abiotic stress related mechanisms such as fatmetabolism, hormones, and glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramide (Na(+) receptor).Na(+) receptor under salt stress gate Ca(2+) influx channels in plants. Notably,the synthesis of secondary metabolites, especially genes related to terpene andphenylpropanoid pathways, was highly regulated. CONCLUSION: The inoculatedendophytes played a possible role in enhancing salt tolerance in peanuts. Futureinvestigations should explore protein-protein interactions between plants andendophytes to unravel the mechanisms underlying endophyte-mediated saltresistance in plants.","Liang, Qihua, Tan, Dedong, Chen, Haohai, Guo, Xiaoli, Afzal, Muhammad, Wang, Xiaolin, Tan, Zhiyuan, Peng, Guixiang",2024,Frontiers in microbiology,2

Substituting mineral fertilizers with organicamendments under water-conserving strategies like mulch can enhance the qualityand yield and improve soil health. Therefore, a two-year study was conducted toexamine the synergistic effects of mulch and reducing inorganic fertilizers andpartially substituting organic amendments on essential oil (EO) yield and itscomposition, and soil properties in Salvia sclarea, an industrially importantcrop. Two mulching practices (M(1): without mulch; M(2): with mulch) and fivenitrogen (N) management practices [N(1): control; N(2): 100% recommended dose ofN i.e.,120 kg/ha; N(3): 25% N through chemical fertilizer (CF) + 75% N throughfarm yard manure (FYM); N(4): 50% N through CF + 50% N through FYM, N(5): 75% Nthrough CF + 25% N through FYM] were taken as experimental treatments, with atotal of ten treatment combinations in a split-plot design during 2021-22 and2022-23. The results showed that applying mulch increased the plant height, leafarea index (LAI), and EO yield. Among N management practices, N(2) outperformedfor all the morpho-physiological and yield parameters studied except stemdiameter and produced at par outcomes with N(5) in case of flower spike perplant, LAI, chlorophyll a and b, flower spike yield, EO content and yield.Optimum soil temperature and moisture under mulching modulate the nutrientconcentration; similarly, N being necessary for photosynthesis, translocation ofnutrients, enzymatic activity, and vegetative and reproductive growth,synergistically enhanced the EO yield and altered the composition. The heat mapdisplayed an inconsistent pattern of the treatment combination's impact on EOcomponents. In soil properties, treatment N(5) recorded highest value ofavailable N at 0-0.15 m soil depth; however, at 0.15-0.30 m, N(2) registered ahigher value and produced at par results with N(5). In case of potassium and soilorganic carbon, T(3) recorded higher value, followed by T(4) and T(5) at0-0.15 m. Considering the soil health and without compromising the EO yield much,the present study suggested replacing 25% of recommended chemical N with organicmanures under mulch for sustainable and economical production of S. sclarea.","Dhiman, Diksha, Vishvamitera, Sakshi, Baghla, Sidharth, Singh, Sanatsujat, Kumar, Dinesh, Kumar, Ashok, Chauhan, Ramesh",2024,Scientific reports,2

However, its low water solubility, highvolatility, difficulty in transport and storage, and decomposition by light,heat, and oxygen limit its wider application. To solve this problem, this studyused freeze-drying or spray-drying, with soybean protein isolate (SPI) or gumArabic (GA), combined with aqueous maltodextrin (MD) as the encapsulating agentsto prepare four types of PPO microcapsules (POMs). Spray-dried microcapsules withGA as the encapsulating agent achieved a high encapsulation efficiency (EE) of92.31 ± 0.31%, improved the thermal stability of the PPO, and had sphericalmorphology. (Headspace solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-massspectrometry) HS-SPME/GC-MS detected 41 volatile compounds in PPO; of these,linalool, β-myrcene, sabinene, and D-limonene were identified as key flavorcomponents. Principal component analysis (PCA) effectively distinguished thesignificant differences in flavor between PPO, spray-dried SPI/MD microcapsules(SS), and spray-dried GA/MD microcapsules (SG). During 15 days of air-exposure,the loss of flavor from SG (54.62 ± 0.54%) was significantly lower than PPO(79.45 ± 1.45%) and SS (57.55 ± 0.36%).

TA039369,10.2147/IJN.S427783,Efficient Sequential Co-Delivery Nanosystem for Inhibition of Tumor andTumor-Associated Fibroblast-Induced Resistance and Metastasis.,"PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal subtype ofbreast cancer. However, the effect of current treatment strategies by inducingtumor cell apoptosis alone is not satisfactory. The growth, metastasis andtreatment sensitivity of tumors can be strongly influenced by cancer-associatedfibroblasts (CAFs) in the microenvironment. Effective cancer therapies may needto target not only the tumor cells directly but also the CAFs that protect them.METHODS: Celastrol and small-sized micelles containing betulinic acid wereco-encapsulated into liposomes using the thin-film hydration method (CL@BM).Folic acid was further introduced to modify liposomes as the targeting moiety(F/CL@BM). We established a novel NIH3T3+4T1 co-culture model to mimic the tumormicroenvironment and assessed the nanocarrier's inhibitory effects onCAFs-induced drug resistance and migration in the co-culture model. The in vivobiological distribution, fluorescence imaging, biological safety evaluation, andcombined therapeutic effect evaluation of the nanocarrier were carried out basedon a triple-negative breast cancer model. RESULTS: In the present study, a novelmultifunctional nano-formulation was designed by combining the advantages ofsequential release, co-loading of tretinoin and betulinic acid, and folicacid-mediated active targeting. As expected, the nano-formulation exhibitedenhanced cytotoxicity in different cellular models and effectively increased drugaccumulation at the tumor site by disrupting the cellular barrier composed ofCAFs by tretinoin. Notably, the co-loaded nano-formulations proved to be morepotent in inhibiting tumor growth in mice and also showed better anti-metastaticeffects in lung metastasis models compared to the formulations with either drugalone. This novel drug delivery system has the potential to be used to developmore effective cancer therapies. CONCLUSION: Targeting CAFs with celastrolsensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy, increasing the efficacy of betulinicacid. The combination of drugs targeting tumor cells and CAFs may lead to moreeffective therapies against various cancers.","Li, Chunhong, Wang, Zhen, Zhang, Yifeng, Zhu, Yuqing, Xu, Maochang, Lei, Hui, Zhang, Dan",2024,International journal of nanomedicine,2
TA039402,10.13081/kjmh.2024.33.1,Medical Applications and Distribution of Borneol during the Joseon Period.,"Borneol(yongnoe) was a fragrance and medicinal ingredient with unique efficacy.However, it could be produced only in tropical Southeast Asia and obtained onlythrough international trade. In addition, camphor(jangnoe) with similar materialproperties was developed and distributed as an inexpensive replacement forborneol, although the processing method is different from that of borneol. Evenin Joseon Korea, borneol and camphor were recognized as separate medicines, andefforts were made to obtain a high-quality borneol. Borneol and camphor have aunique effect of relieving inflammation, pain and heavy feeling, so it could bewidely applied to symptoms in various diseases. During the Joseon period, borneolwas a rare item that could only be obtained through foreign trade, and it wasalso used for perfumes and insect repellents, but most widely used as medicine.There are many records of actually prescribing borneol to the royal family, andmany medicines containing borneol and its effective symptoms were also recordedin the medical books. Borneol was able to spread widely in Joseon society thanksto the practice of distributing 'nabyak' to court officials every year in thetwelfth month of the lunar calendar. Since nabyak was used as a householdmedicine that was stored and used when necessary, pills containing borneol thatcould be applied to various symptoms were suitable for this purpose. Despiteconsiderable medical demand, borneol was one of the important 'dangyakjae', theChinese medicines imported to Joseon. During the Joseon period, borneol wasimported through China and Japan, but genuine borneol was difficult to obtain, soit was often presented to Joseon as gifts of envoy trade. It is thought thatcamphor was also imported, but it is not well mentioned in official records ormedical books reflecting national demand. Perhaps this is thought to be becausethe government prioritized securing better quality borneol rather than campher.In the early 17th century, due to the instability of the envoy's route to theMing Dynasty, Joseon had to import borneol only through the sea. As a result,there were problems with the supply and quality of borneol, and national interestin Japanese borneol temporarily increased. However, as the relationship with theQing Dynasty stabilized, a system was established to import national borneoldemand through the annual envoy trade. Naeuiwon, the medical center for the royalfamily is in charge of securing and prescribing Chinese medicines, but the costwas covered by the silver paid by Hojo, the ministry of finance of JoseonDynasty. Since the amount of Chinese medicines used in the preparation of nabyakwas not small, the financial burden of importing enough medicines includingborneol increased. The purveyors for government played a role in supplyingChinese medicines to the government. Their appearance shows that privatemerchants were actively involved in the trade of Chinese medicines includingborneol. The formation of the medicinal market by private merchants' activitiesgreatly contributed to the widespread expansion of the applications anddistribution of borneol.","Kwon, Kiseok",2024,Ui sahak,2

(C. minima), a TCM herb, specifically against lung cancer. However, theunderlying mechanisms of its effects remain elusive. This study employs networkpharmacology and experimental analyses to unravel the molecular mechanisms ofBrevilin A in lung cancer. METHODS: The Batman-TCM, Swiss Target Prediction,Pharmmapper, SuperPred, and BindingDB databases were screened to identifyBrevilin A targets. Lung cancer-related targets were sourced from GEO, Genecards,OMIM, TTD, and Drugbank databases. Utilizing Cytoscape software, aprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established. Gene Ontology (GO),Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene set enrichment analysis(GSEA), and gene-pathway correlation analysis were conducted using R software. Tovalidate network pharmacology results, molecular docking, molecular dynamicssimulations, and in vitro experiments were performed. RESULTS: We identified 599Brevilin A-associated targets and 3864 lung cancer-related targets, with 155overlapping genes considered as candidate targets for Brevilin A against lungcancer. The PPI network highlighted STAT3, TNF, HIF1A, PTEN, ESR1, and MTOR aspotential therapeutic targets. GO and KEGG analyses revealed 2893 enriched GOterms and 157 enriched KEGG pathways, including the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,FoxO signaling pathway, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. GSEA demonstrated a closeassociation between hub genes and lung cancer. Gene-pathway correlation analysisindicated significant associations between hub genes and the cellular response tohypoxia pathway. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations confirmed BrevilinA's interaction with PTEN and HIF1A, respectively. In vitro experimentsdemonstrated Brevilin A-induced dose- and time-dependent cell death in A549cells. Notably, Brevilin A treatment significantly reduced HIF-1α mRNA expressionwhile increasing PTEN mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates thatBrevilin A exerts anti-cancer effects in treating lung cancer through amulti-target and multi-pathway manner, with the HIF pathway potentially beinginvolved. These results lay a theoretical foundation for the prospective clinicalapplication of Brevilin A.","Wang, Ruixue, Gao, Cuiyun, Yu, Meng, Song, Jialing, Feng, Zhenzhen, Wang, Ruyu, Pan, Huafeng, Liu, Haimeng, Li, Wei, Fan, Xiangzhen",2024,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2

In the last decade, N. oceanica hasbecome a model organism for oleaginous microalgae to develop sustainableprocesses to produce biomolecules of interest by exploiting its photosyntheticactivity and carbon assimilation properties. N. oceanica can accumulate lipids upto 70% of total dry weight and contains the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoicacid (EPA) required for both food and feed applications. The genome sequence,other omics data, and synthetic biology tools are available for this species,including an engineered strain called LP-tdTomato, which allows homologousrecombination to insert the heterologous genes in a highly transcribed locus inthe nucleolus region. Here, N. oceanica was engineered to induce highketocarotenoid and canthaxanthin production. RESULTS: We used N. oceanicaLP-tdTomato strain as a background to express the key enzyme for ketocarotenoidproduction, a β-carotene ketolase (CrBKT) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Throughthe LP-tdTomato strain, the transgene insertion by homologous recombination in ahighly transcribed genomic locus can be screened by negative fluorescence. Theoverexpression of CrBKT in bkt transformants increased the content of carotenoidsand ketocarotenoids per cell, respectively, 1.5 and 10-fold, inducing anorange/red color in the bkt cell cultures. Background (LP) and bkt linesproductivity were compared at different light intensities from 150 to 1200 µmolm(-2) s(-1): at lower irradiances, the growth kinetics of bkt lines were slowercompared to LP, while higher productivity was measured for bkt lines at 1200 µmolm(-2) s(-1). Despite these results, the highest canthaxanthin and ketocarotenoidsproductivity were obtained upon cultivation at 150 µmol m(-2) s(-1). CONCLUSIONS:Through targeted gene redesign and heterologous transformation, ketocarotenoidsand canthaxanthin content were significantly increased, achieving 0.3% and 0.2%dry weight. Canthaxanthin could be produced using CO(2) as the only carbon sourceat 1.5 mg/L titer. These bkt-engineered lines hold potential for industrialapplications in fish or poultry feed sectors, where canthaxanthin andketocarotenoids are required as pigmentation agents.","Canini, Davide, Martini, Flavio, Cazzaniga, Stefano, Miotti, Tea, Pacenza, Beatrice, D'Adamo, Sarah, Ballottari, Matteo",2024,Microbial cell factories,2

Analysis using LC-MS/MS confirmed the presence of vincristine as aproduct of the vinblastine biotransformation by two Pseudomonas spp. P.fluorescens 2421 showed a faster conversion rate with 95% of vinblastinetransformed within 24 h than P. aeruginosa 8485, which demonstrated a conversionrate of 92% on the 8(th) day. From LC-MS/MS analysis, the optimal conditions forthe reaction were determined as vinblastine (25 µl), microbial inoculums (150 µlor 200 × 10(6) and 210 × 10(6) CFU/ml), pH 7.4, rotation speed of 180 rpm, andtemperatures of 30 °C and 37 °C with incubation time of 8 days. The vincristineproduced exhibited potent antiangiogenic activity in the CAM assay reducing thethickness and branching of blood vessels in a dose-dependent manner. The studyconcludes that both Pseudomonas spp. showed promise for vincristine productionfrom vinblastine, without compromising its antiangiogenic properties.","Srivastava, Gauri, Mittal, Ruchika, Srivastava, Nidhi, Ganjewala, Deepak",2024,Scientific reports,2
TA039691,10.1007/s00421-024-05609-w,Determination of the optimal dose and dosing strategy for effective L-mentholoral rinsing during exercise in hot environments.,"PURPOSE: This multi-study programme investigated the optimal concentration ofL-menthol delivered as an oral mouth rinse to modulate thermo-behaviour duringexercise in a hot environment (35 °C). METHOD: In study 1, 38 participantscompleted a survey to establish an effective and tolerable range of L-mentholconcentration. 31 participants completed an RPE-protocol examining 1. thedose-response effect of L-menthol mouth rinse on exercise performance (n = 16)and 2. the temporal effectiveness of administering L-menthol in an incrementaland decremental dosing pattern (n = 15). Power output, heart rate, body coretemperature and thermal sensation were reported throughout. RESULTS: The optimalmenthol concentration for peak power was between 0.01 and 0.1% (~ 6% increase,P < 0.05) and 0.5% (~ 9% increase, P < 0.05) with respect to control. Workcompleted was increased at 0.01% (~ 5%, P < 0.05), at 0.1% (~ 3%, P < 0.05) andhad a detrimental effect at 0.5% (- 10% decrease, P < 0.05). There were nodifferences between an ascending dose protocol (0.01 to 0.5%), descending doseprotocol (0.5-0.01%) or a constant 0.01% dose protocol. There were no reporteddifferences in body core temperature or heart rate across trials (P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: The optimal dose of L-menthol when delivered via oral rinsing isbetween 0.01 and 0.1%. At lower concentrations, L-menthol appears to be lesseffective and at higher concentrations (> 0.5%) L-menthol appears to elicitgreater irritation and may not positively modulate thermo-behaviour duringexercise in a hot environment.","Jeffries, Owen, Jibi, Godi, Clark, Joe, Barwood, Martin, Waldron, Mark",2025,European journal of applied physiology,2

Nees Seedlings.,"Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolisms participate in N source-regulatedsecondary metabolism in medicinal plants, but the specific mechanisms involvedremain to be investigated. By using nitrate (NN), ammonium (AN), urea (UN), andglycine (GN), respectively, as sole N sources, we found that N sources remarkablyaffected the contents of diterpenoid lactone components along with C and Nmetabolisms reprograming in Andrographis paniculata, as compared to NN, the otherthree N sources raised the levels of 14-deoxyandrographolide, andrographolide,dehydroandrographolide (except UN), and neoandrographolide (except AN) with aprominent accumulation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). These N sources alsoraised the photosynthetic rate and the levels of fructose and/or sucrose butreduced the activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and pyruvatedehydrogenase (PDH). Conversely, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) andmalate enzyme (ME) activities were upregulated. Simultaneously, citrate,cis-aconitate and isocitrate levels declined, and N assimilation was inhibited.These results indicated that AN, UN and GN reduced the metabolic flow ofcarbohydrates from glycolysis into the TCA cycle and downstream N assimilation.Furthermore, they enhanced arginine and GABA metabolism, which increased Creplenishment of the TCA cycle, and increased ethylene and salicylic acid (SA)levels. Thus, we proposed that the N sources reprogrammed C and N metabolism,attenuating the competition of N assimilation for C, and promoting the synthesisand accumulation of andrographolide through plant hormone signaling. To obtain ahigher production of andrographolide in A. paniculata, AN fertilizer isrecommended in its N management.","Jian, Shaofen, Wan, Si, Lin, Yang, Zhong, Chu",2024,International journal of molecular sciences,2

Perillyl alcohol (POH), a natural monoterpene found invarious plant essential oils, has shown neuroprotective properties, though itseffects on HIE are not well understood. This study investigates theneuroprotective effects of POH on HIE both in vitro and in vivo. We establishedan in vitro model using glucose deprivation and hypoxia/reperfusion (OGD/R) inPC12 cells, alongside an in vivo model via the modified Rice-Vannucci method.Results indicated that POH acted as an indirect antioxidant, reducing induciblenitric oxide synthase and malondialdehyde production, maintaining content ofantioxidant molecules and enzymes in OGD/R-induced PC12 cells. In vivo, POHremarkably lessened infarct volume, reduced cerebral edema, accelerated tissueregeneration, and blocked reactive astrogliosis after hypoxic-ischemic braininjury. POH exerted antiapoptotic activities through both the intrinsic andextrinsic apoptotic pathways. Mechanistically, POH activated Nrf2 and inactivatedits negative regulator Keap1. The use of ML385, a Nrf2 inhibitor, reversed theseeffects. Overall, POH mitigates neuronal damage in HIE by combating oxidativestress, reducing inflammation, and inhibiting apoptosis via the Nrf2/Keap1pathway, suggesting its potential for HIE treatment.","Fang, Yu, Zheng, Yihui, Gao, Qiqi, Pang, Mengdan, Wu, Yiqing, Feng, Xiaoli, Tao, Xiaoyue, Hu, Yingying, Lin, Zhenlang, Lin, Wei",2024,Redox report : communications in free radical research,2

This study investigatedthe insecticidal potential of essential oils (EOs) from P. aduncum, collectedduring the dry and rainy seasons, against fleas (Ctenocephalides felis felisBouché, 1835) in egg and adult stages. The EOs were obtained by hydrodistillationusing a modified Clevenger apparatus for 2 h. Qualitative and quantitativeanalysis were performed via gas chromatography. The findings revealed thatdillapiole was the predominant substance in both EOs, accounting for 77.6%(rainy) and 85.5% (dry) of the EOs. These EOs exhibited high efficacy against theparasite C. felis felis, resulting in 100% egg mortality at a concentration of100 μg/mL and 100% mortality for adult fleas starting from 1,000 μg/mL.Dillapiole standard was also effective but at a relatively high concentration.This finding suggested that EOs from P. aduncum exhibit cytotoxicity againstthese pests and might hold potential for commercial production, offeringpractical applications for such bioprospecting. This study uniquely revealed thatthe EOs from P. aduncum, which is rich in dillapiole, demonstrated pulicidalactivity against the parasite C. felis felis, particularly in inhibiting thehatching of the eggs of these parasites.","Assunção, Jeferson Adriano E Silva, Machado, Daniel de Brito, Felisberto, Jessica Sales, Chaves, Douglas Siqueira de Almeida, Campos, Diefrey Ribeiro, Cid, Yara Peluso, Sadgrove, Nicholas John, Ramos, Ygor Jessé, Moreira, Davyson de Lima",2024,Revista brasileira de parasitologia veterinaria = Brazilian journal of veterinaryparasitology : Orgao Oficial do Colegio Brasileiro de Parasitologia Veterinaria,2

Lycopene, a natural hydrocarbon carotenoid,possesses potent antioxidant properties. This study aimed to investigate theimpact of lycopene on growth performance, meat quality, cecal microflora, andliver metabolome in broilers subjected to heat stress. A total of 480 yellowfeather broilers were randomly allocated into 4 treatment groups: birds fedstandard diet (Con), birds fed standard diet and supplemented with lycopene(Lyc), birds fed standard diet and subjected to heat stress (Hs), and birds fedwith lycopene and subjected to heat stress (Hs-Lyc). As compared with the normaltemperature groups, Hs decreased the average daily gain (ADG) of birds during d 1to 28, lowered the pH value either in breast meat or thigh meat, increased the L*value of breast meat, and decreased the a* value of thigh meat. In comparisonwith non-Lyc feeding birds, Lyc supplement elevated the ADG during d 1 to 56,increased the pH of breast meat, decrease the L* and b* values of thigh meat,simultaneously increase the a* value of thigh meat. The L* of breast meat and pHof thigh meat exhibited significant differences under Hs-Lyc treatment.Lyc-treated birds exhibited higher elasticity, gumminess, and resilience inbreast meat than those in non-Lyc feeding birds. The cecal metagenome analysisindicated that Hs-Lyc treatment increased the abundance of Phocaeicolasalanitronis and Prevotella sp.CAG:1058, Bacteroides sp.An269, and Bacteroidessp.An19 at the species level compared with other treatments. The hepaticuntargeted metabolome analysis showed that administration of Lyc upregulated 20metabolites and downregulated 60 metabolites compared to the Con birds.Futhermore, the Hs-Lyc treatment upregulated 34 metabolites and downregulated 45metabolites compared to the Hs birds. The correlation between the metagenome andmetabolome showed that Lyc supplementation induced significant alterations in thecitrate cycle, metabolism of butanoate, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glyoxylateand dicarboxylate, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate compared with standardsupplement. In contrast, Hs-Lyc treatment induced alterations in the citratecycle, metabolism of pyruvate, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate,glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, arginine, proline, alanine, aspartate, and glutamatecompared with the standard supplement of heat-challenged broilers. In summary,dietary Lyc supplementation promoted the growth performance, changed the meatquality, modulated the cecal metagenome and hepatic metabolome in heat-stressedbroilers.","Yang, Huijuan, Liu, Yingsen, Cao, Guangtian, Liu, Jinsong, Xiao, Shiping, Xiao, Peng, Tao, Ye, Gao, Hong",2024,Poultry science,2

To date, there is no effective cure for thispathology, and the majority of marketed formulations eliminate both healthy andpathological microbiota. Therefore, hereby we propose the encapsulation of anantimicrobial natural compound (thymol) loaded into lipid nanostructured systemsto be topically used against acne. METHODS: To address this issue, nanostructuredlipid carriers (NLC) capable of encapsulating thymol, a natural compound used forthe treatment of acne vulgaris, were developed either using ultrasonication probeor high-pressure homogenization and optimized using 2(2)-star factorial design byanalyzing the effect of NLC composition on their physicochemical parameters.These NLC were optimized using a design of experiments approach and werecharacterized using different physicochemical techniques. Moreover, short-termstability and cell viability using HaCat cells were assessed. Antimicrobialefficacy of the developed NLC was assessed in vitro and ex vivo. RESULTS: NLCencapsulating thymol were developed and optimized and demonstrated a prolongedthymol release. The formulation was dispersed in gels and a screening of severalgels was carried out by studying their rheological properties and their skinretention abilities. From them, carbomer demonstrated the capacity to be highlyretained in skin tissues, specifically in the epidermis and dermis layers.Moreover, antimicrobial assays against healthy and pathological skin pathogensdemonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of thymol-loaded NLC gelling systems sinceNLC are more efficient in slowly reducing C. acnes viability, but they possesslower antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis, compared to free thymol.CONCLUSION: Thymol was successfully loaded into NLC and dispersed in gellingsystems, demonstrating that it is a suitable candidate for topical administrationagainst acne vulgaris by eradicating pathogenic bacteria while preserving thehealthy skin microbiome.","Folle, Camila, Marqués, Ana M, Díaz-Garrido, Natalia, Carvajal-Vidal, Paulina, Sánchez López, Elena, Suñer-Carbó, Joaquim, Halbaut, Lyda, Mallandrich, Mireia, Espina, Marta, Badia, Josefa, Baldoma, Laura, García, Maria Luisa, Calpena, Ana Cristina",2024,International journal of nanomedicine,2

The MMPBSA method was used tocalculate the binding-free energy. The pkCSM server and DruLiTo software wereused for Absorption, Distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET)analysis and drug-likeness analysis. Finally, in vitro experiments were conductedto validate the results. RESULTS: A total of 27 cDEGs had been identified. ThePPI and enrichment results indicated that TNF-α was considered to be the coretarget. A total of 80 active compounds were retrieved. The molecular dockingresults indicated that tanshinone I (TSI), tanshinone IIA (TSIIA), and hydroxylsafflower yellow A (HSYA) were selected as core active compounds. Moleculardynamics verification revealed that the conformations were relatively stablewithout significant fluctuations. MMPBSA analysis revealed that the bindingenergies of TSI, TSIIA, and HSYA with TNF-α were -36.01, -21.71, and -14.80kcal/mol, respectively. LEU57 residue of TNF-α has the highest contribution. TSIand TSIIA passed both the ADMET analysis and drug-likeness screening, whereasHSYA did not. Experimental verification confirmed that DHI and TSIIA reduced theexpression of TNF-α, NLRP3, and IL-1β in the injured H9C2 and rat brainmicrovascular endothelial cells.

TA040242,10.3390/microorganisms12102040,Deciphering Hyperammonia-Producing Bacteria (HAB) in the Rumen of Water Buffaloes(Bubalus bubalis) and Their Inhibition through Plant Extracts and Essential Oils.,"Hyperammonia-producing bacteria (HAB) are a class of microbes present in thestomach of ruminants, responsible for the rapid rate of ammonia production fromprotein degradation beyond the capacity of these animals for their utilization.Thus, ruminant nutritionists are interested in decreasing ruminal proteindegradation and ammonia genesis by focusing on controlling the activity of HAB.The investigations of the present study were carried out to determine predominanthyperammonia-producing bacteria in the rumen of buffaloes, their isolation andcharacterization, as well as the inhibition of these isolates with varioussources of plant secondary compounds (tannins, saponins, and essential oils).Studies employing high-throughput sequencing of amplicons of the 16S rRNA genefrom genomic DNA recovered from enrichment culture of HAB of buffalo ruminaindicated that, at the phylum level, Proteobacteria (61.1 to 68.2%) was the mostpredominant HAB. Acidaminococcus was most predominant among the identifiedgenera. In vitro experiments were conducted with enrichment culture of buffalorumen contents incubated with different types of feed additives such as essentialoils (eucalyptus oil, lemon grass oil, and clove oil) and extracts of plants(Sapindus mukorossi fruits and Ficus bengalensis leaves), each at graded doselevels. The reduction in ammonia production by clove and lemon grass oils wasevident due to the presence of major bioactive compounds, especially eugenol andlimonene, which have strong antimicrobial activity. However, clove oil and Indiansoapberry/reetha (Sapindus mukorossi) fruit were found to be promising andeffective in reducing the growth, protease production, and ammonia production ofHAB culture.","Chanu, Yendrembam Mery, Paul, Shyam Sundar, Dey, Avijit, Andonissamy, Jerome",2024,Microorganisms,2
TA040267,10.3390/molecules29174016,UHPLC-QTOF-MS-Based Targeted Metabolomics Provides Novel Insights into theAccumulative Mechanism of Soil Types on the Bioactive Components of Salviamiltiorrhiza.,"The root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (SMB) has been widely used to treatcardiovascular diseases. However, the contents of secondary metabolites in theroots from different production areas are significantly different, and the impactof soil factors on this accumulation remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimedto elucidate the regularity of variation between the active components and soilfactors through targeted metabolomics and chemical dosimetry. Soils werecollected from five different cities (A, B, C, D, and E) and transplanted intothe study area. The results showed that there were significant differences in thesoil fertility characteristics and heavy metal pollution levels in differentsoils. Ten water- and twelve lipid-soluble metabolites were identified in SMBsgrown in all soil types. SMBs from D cities exhibited the highest totaltanshinone content (p < 0.05). The salvianolic acid B content in SMBs from Ecities was the highest (p < 0.05). Interestingly, correlation analysis revealed asignificant negative correlation between the accumulation of lipid-soluble andwater-soluble metabolites. Double-matrix correlation analysis demonstrated thatavailable potassium (AK) was significantly negatively correlated with salvianolicacid B (r = -0.80, p = 0.0004) and positively correlated with tanshinone IIA (r =0.66, p = 0.008). Conversely, cadmium (Cd) and cuprum (Cu) were significantlypositively and negatively correlated with salvianolic acid B (r = 0.96, p <0.0001 and r = 0.72, p = 0.0024) and tanshinone IIA (r = 0.40, p = 0.14 and r =0.73, p = 0.0018), respectively. Mantel's test indicated that AK (r > 0.52, p <0.001), Cu (r > 0.60, p < 0.005), and Cd (r > 0.31, p < 0.05) were the primarydrivers of the differences in the active components of SMBs. These findingsprovide a theoretical framework for modulating targeted metabolites of SMBthrough soil factors, with significant implications for the cultivation andquality control of medicinal plants.","Hou, Mengmeng, Gao, Dan, Chen, Weixu, Jiang, Wenjun, Yu, Dade, Li, Xiwen",2024,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA040273,10.1186/s12906-024-04474-6,Neuroprotective effect of acetoxypachydiol against oxidative stress throughactivation of the Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Excessive oxidative stress in the brain is an important pathologicalfactor in neurological diseases. Acetoxypachydiol (APHD) is a lipophilicgermacrane-type diterpene extracted as a major component from different speciesof brown algae within the genus Dictyota. There have been no previous reports onthe pharmacological activity of APHD. The present research aims to explore thepotential neuroprotective properties of APHD and its underlying mechanisms.METHODS: The possible mechanism of APHD was predicted using a combination ofmolecular docking and network pharmacological analysis. PC12 cells were inducedby H(2)O(2) and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R), respectively.Western blot, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, and qRT-PCR were usedto investigate the antioxidant activity of APHD. The HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP and Nrf2gene silencing were employed to confirm the influence of APHD on the signalingcascade involving HO-1, Nrf2, and Keap1 in vitro. RESULTS: APHD exhibitedantioxidant activity in both PC12 cells subjected to H(2)O(2) and OGD/Rconditions by downregulating the release of LDH, the concentrations of MDA, andROS, and upregulating SOD, GSH-Px, and GSH concentrations. APHD could potentiallyinitiate the Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 signaling cascade, according to the findings fromnetwork pharmacology evaluation and molecular docking. Furthermore, APHD wasobserved to increase Nrf2 and HO-1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels,while downregulating the protein concentrations of Keap1. Both Nrf2 silencing andtreatment with ZnPP reversed the neuroprotective effects of APHD. CONCLUSIONS:APHD activated antioxidant enzymes and downregulated the levels of LDH, MDA, andROS in two cell models. The neuroprotective effect is presumably reliant onupregulation of the Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Taken together, APHD from brownalgae of the genus Dictyota shows potential as a candidate for novelneuroprotective agents.","Qi, Yu, Liu, Ge, Jin, Shengjie, Jian, Rong, Zou, Ziqiang, Wang, Chenjing, Zhang, Yuanlong, Zhao, Min, Zhu, Haoru, Yan, Pengcheng",2024,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2

METHODS: Amouse OA model was established. Mice were intragastrically administered with SSD(0, 5, 10 μmol/L) or injected with miR-199-3p antagomir into the knee. Then,pathological changes in cartilage tissues were observed. Normal chondrocytes andOA chondrocytes were isolated and identified. Chondrocytes were treated with SSDand/or transfected with oligonucleotides or plasmid vectors targeting miR-199-3pand TCF4. Cell viability, apoptosis, inflammation, and autophagy were assessed.miR-199-3p and TCF4 expressions were measured, and their targeting relationshipwas analyzed. RESULTS: In in vivo experiments, SSD ameliorated cartilagehistopathological damage, decreased inflammatory factor content and promotedautophagy in OA mice. miR-199-3p expression was downregulated and TCF4 expressionwas upregulated in cartilage tissues of OA mice. miR-199-3p expression wasupregulated and TCF4 expression was downregulated after SSD treatment.Downregulation of miR-199-3p attenuated the effect of SSD on OA mice. In in vitroexperiments, SSD inhibited the inflammatory response and promoted autophagy in OAchondrocytes. Downregulation of miR-199-3p attenuated the effect of SSD on OAchondrocytes. In addition, upregulation of miR-199-3p alone inhibitedinflammatory responses and promoted autophagy in OA chondrocytes. miR-199-3ptargeted TCF4. Upregulation of TCF4 attenuated the effects of miR-199-3pupregulation on OA chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: SSD alleviates inflammatoryresponse and mediates autophagy in OA via elevating miR-199-3p to target TCF4.","Yan, Ming, Zhang, DaWei, Yang, Min",2024,Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,2

Artemisinin andits derivatives are safe compounds that have recently been proven to possesspotent anti-tumor effects in vivo, through inhibition of cancer cell growth. Theaim of this study is to assess the efficiency of artemisinin as a cancertreatment alone and as a pre-treatment fore cisplatin therapy for high gradeurothelial carcinoma. METHODS: Sixty male albino mice were divided into sixgroups, and BBN was used to induce urinary bladder cancer. Blood samples weretested for renal functions and complete blood counts, kidney and urinary bladdertissues were harvested for histopathological examination. Total RNAs from urinarybladder tissues was collected, and gene expression of FGFR3, HRAS, P53, and KDM6Awas quantified using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared to the induced cancer group, theresults revealed that FGFR3 expression levels were down-regulated in the inducedcancer group treated by artemisinin only and the induced cancer group pre-treatedwith artemisinin prior to cisplatin by ~ 0.86-fold and 0.4-folds, respectively,aligning with HRAS down-regulation by ~ 9.54-fold and 9.05-fold, respectively.Whereas, P53 expression levels were up-regulated by ~ 0.68-fold and 0.84-fold,respectively, in parallel with KDM6A expression, which is up-regulatedby ~ 0.95-folds and 5.27-folds, respectively. Also, serum creatinine and urealevels decreased significantly in the induced cancer group treated by artemisininalone and the induced cancer group pre-treated with artemisinin prior tocisplatin, whereas the induced cancer group treated by cisplatin their levelsincreased significantly. Moreover, Hb, PLT, RBC, and WBC counts improved in bothcancer groups treated by artemisinin alone and pre-treated with artemisinin priorto cisplatin.

It is characterized by chronic proteinuria, hypertension, andkidney function decline, can progress to end-stage renal disease, loweringpatients' quality of life and lifespan. Inflammation and apoptosis are key to DNdevelopment. Network pharmacology, clinical correlation, and basic experimentalvalidation to find out how NGR1 might work to reduce inflammation in DNtreatment. The study aims to improve DN treatment with new findings. METHODS: Todetermine how NGR1 treats DN, this study used network pharmacology, clinicalcorrelation, and basic experimental validation. Three methods were used topredict NGR1 drug targets: ChEMBL, SuperPred, and Swiss Target Prediction. Drugtargets are linked to diseases by molecular docking. A clinical correlationanalysis using the Nephroseq Classic (V4) database looked at the strong linkbetween medication targets and the development, progression, and renal functionof DN. Additional research showed that NGR1 reduces high blood sugar-inducedpodocyte inflammation. RESULTS: The integrin subunit beta 8 (ITGB8) protein is apotential NGR1 therapeutic target for DN. It may be linked to inflammatoryproteins like caspase 3 and IL-18. Validation of the molecular docking showedthat SER-407, ALA-22, Ala-343, and TYR-406 form hydrogen bonds with NGR1 andITGB8. These interactions represent pharmacodynamic targets. Clinical correlationshowed that DN patients had significantly lower ITGB8 expression levels thanhealthy individuals. Between 50 and 80 years old, DN patients' ITGB8 expressionlevels decreased. ITGB8 expression was lowest in renal function conditions, witheGFR values of 15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2. In the db/db mouse model, downregulation ofITGB8 expression in renal tissue was associated with renal inflammatory damage.The hyperglycemic group had significantly lower levels of nephrin and caspase-3protein, but higher levels of cleaved caspase-1 protein. Giving NGR1 in differentamounts (1, 3, 10, and 30 µM) greatly decreased the expression of caspase3,stopped the expression of cleaved caspase1, and lowered the damage caused byNLRP3 in podocytes. CONCLUSION: We identified several NGR1 pharmacologicaltargets and found that the ITGB8 protein is a key drug target linked toinflammation and DN. ITGB8 is critical for DN development and can help to reducehigh blood sugar-induced podocyte inflammation.","Li, ChangYan, Geng, Chen, Wang, JiangMing, Shi, Luyao, Ma, JingYuan, Liang, Zhang, Fan, WenXing",2024,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",2

We used activity screening to demonstrate that treatment ofNipponbare seeds with 25 μg/mL isopimaric acid significantly increased theresulting shoot length, root length, and shoot weight of rice seedlings by 11.37± 5.05%, 12.96 ± 7.63%, and 27.98 ± 10.88% and that it has a higher activity thanGibberellin A3 (GA(3)) at the same concentration. A total of 213 inbred lines ofdifferent rice lineages were screened, and we found that isopimaric acid haddifferent growth promotional activities on rice seedlings of different varieties.After induction with 25 μg/mL isopimaric acid, 15.02% of the rice varietiestested showed increased growth, while 15.96% of the varieties showed decreasedgrowth; the growth of the remaining 69.02% did not show any significant changefrom the control. In the rice varieties showing an increase in growth, the shootlength and shoot weight significantly increased, accounting for 21.88% and31.25%. The root length and weight significantly increased, accounting for 6.25%and 3.13%. Using genome-wide association studies (GWASs), linkage disequilibriumblock, and gene haplotype significance analysis, we identified single nucleotidepolymorphism (SNP) signals that were significantly associated with the length andweight of shoots on chromosomes 2 and 8, respectively. After that, we obtained 17candidate genes related to the length of shoots and 4 candidate genes related tothe weight of shoots. Finally, from the gene annotation data and genetissue-specific expression; two genes related to this isopimaric acid regulationphenotype were identified as OsASC1 (LOC_Os02g37080) on chromosome 2 and OsBUD13(LOC_Os08g08080) on chromosome 8. Subcellular localization analysis indicatedthat OsASC1 was expressed in the plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane, whileOsBUD13 was expressed in the nucleus. Further RT-qPCR analysis showed that therelative expression levels of the resistance gene OsASC1 and the antibody proteingene OsBUD13 decreased significantly following treatment with 25 μg/mL isopimaricacid. These results suggest that isopimaric acid may inhibit defense pathways inorder to promote the growth of rice seedlings.","Luo, Xiaomeng, Bai, Liping, Huang, Jiaqi, Peng, Luying, Hua, Juan, Luo, Shihong",2024,International journal of molecular sciences,2
TA040369,10.31557/APJCP.2024.25.3.921,Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Studies of Brucein D against T24 Bladder Cancer Cells.,"OBJECTIVE: Brucein D (BrD), a quassinoid isolated from Brucea javanica fruit,reportedly demonstrates anti-cancer activity. This study's objective is toevaluate the cytotoxicity of Brucein D and its ability to induce apoptosis in T24bladder cancer cells. METHODS: We investigated the cytotoxic activity of BrDagainst the T24 cell through the induction of apoptosis in vitro. This cytotoxicactivity was evaluated with ΜΤΤ assay and followed by Calcein-AM/PI viabilitystaining. Apoptotic activity was determined with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stainingand DNA fragmentation. Doxorubicin and docetaxel were used as a positive control.Evaluation of apoptotic-related gene expression, Bax, Bak, Bcl2, and p53 was alsoperformed using semi-quantitative PCR analysis. Statistical analysis wasconducted using One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc test Turkey's HSD (HonestlySignificance Difference). RESULTS: Results show that BrD had high toxicityagainst T24 bladder cancer cells with an IC50 value of 7.65 ± 1.2 µg/mL butrelatively less toxic to 1BR3 normal skin fibroblast cells compared to thedoxorubicin and docetaxel treated cells. The viability assay shows that BrDsignificantly increases the percentage of dead cells relative to control in adose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the percentage of cells with apoptoticappearance was significantly higher in group treated with BrD IC50 (56.04±3.09%)compared to control (9.42±2.88). The result was similar to doxorubicin IC50(58.97±12.31) but lower than docetaxel IC50 (74.42±9.79). DNA fragmentation ingel electrophoresis was also observed in T24 cells treated with BrD. Apoptosiswas also verified by an alteration in the expression of apoptosis-related genes,upregulation of Bax, Bak, and p53, and downregulation of Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: BrDhas shown a cytotoxic effect against T24 bladder cancer cells. Hence, it is apromising natural compound for the management of bladder cancer by induction ofapoptosis through activation of the intrinsic pathway, with low toxicity tonormal cells.","Nandana, Pandu Ishaq, Rasyid, Haerani, Prihantono, Prihantono, Yustisia, Ika, Hakim, Lukman, Bukhari, Agussalim, Prasedya, Eka Sunarwidhi",2024,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2
TA040417,10.1002/edm2.482,Stevioside Ameliorates Palmitic Acid-Induced Abnormal Glucose Uptake via thePDK4/AMPK/TBC1D1 Pathway in C2C12 Myotubes.,"BACKGROUND: Stevioside (SV) with minimal calories is widely used as a naturalsweetener in beverages due to its high sweetness and safety. However, the effectsof SV on glucose uptake and the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme (PDK4) asan important protein in the regulation of glucose metabolism, remain largelyunexplored. In this study, we used C2C12 skeletal muscle cells that was inducedby palmitic acid (PA) to assess the effects and mechanisms of SV on glucoseuptake and PDK4. METHODS: The glucose uptake of C2C12 cells was determined by2-NBDG; expression of the Pdk4 gene was measured by quantitative real-time PCR;and expression of the proteins PDK4, p-AMPK, TBC1D1 and GLUT4 was assessed byWestern blotting. RESULTS: In PA-induced C2C12 myotubes, SV could significantlypromote cellular glucose uptake by decreasing PDK4 levels and increasing p-AMPKand TBC1D1 levels. SV could promote the translocation of GLUT4 from the cytoplasmto the cell membrane in cells. Moreover, in Pdk4-overexpressing C2C12 myotubes,SV decreased the level of PDK4 and increased the levels of p-AMPK and TBC1D1.CONCLUSION: SV was found to ameliorate PA-induced abnormal glucose uptake via thePDK4/AMPK/TBC1D1 pathway in C2C12 myotubes. Although these results warrantedfurther investigation for validation, they may provide some evidence of SV as asafe natural sweetener for its use in sugar-free beverages to prevent and controlT2DM.","Zhang, Changfa, Li, Shuai, Li, Likang, Wang, Ruoting, Luo, Shiming, Li, Guowei",2024,"Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",2

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was usedto examine the morphology of the stem and leaf surfaces. Essential oil excretoryglands were detected on both the leaves and stem surfaces. The essential oilswere isolated by hydrodistillation, and their chemical composition was determinedby gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Sage essential oils weremixtures of terpene compounds, among which the most common were: α- andβ-thujone, camphor, and 1,8-cineol. Cytotoxic activity was tested using MTS assayon multiple cell lines: normal and immortalized fibroblasts (HF77FA andHDF-Tert), immortalized lung line (BEAS-2B), and breast adenocarcinoma(MDA-MB-231). The growth of treated cells was determined relative to controlconditions without treatment. The immortalized lung line was the least resistantto the activity of the essential oils, whereas immortalized fibroblasts were themost resistant.

TA040731,10.7717/peerj.14914,Transcriptome analysis of transcription factors and enzymes involved inmonoterpenoid biosynthesis in different chemotypes of Mentha haplocalyx Briq.,"BACKGROUND: The main active ingredients of Mentha haplocalyx Briq. essential oilsare monoterpenes. According to the component of essential oils, M. haplocalyx canbe divided into different chemotypes. Chemotype variation is widespread in Menthaplants but its formation mechanism is unclear. METHODS: We selected the stablechemotype l-menthol, pulegone, and carvone of M. haplocalyx for transcriptomesequencing. To further investigate the variation of chemotypes, we analyzed thecorrelation between differential transcription factors (TFs) and key enzymes.RESULTS: Fourteen unigenes related to monoterpenoid biosynthesis were identified,among which (+)-pulegone reductase (PR) and (-)-menthol dehydrogenase (MD) weresignificantly upregulated in l-menthol chemotype and (-)-limonene 6-hydroxylasewas significantly upregulated in carvone chemotype. In addition, 2,599 TFs from66 families were identified from transcriptome data and the differential TFsincluded 113 TFs from 34 families. The families of bHLH, bZIP, AP2/ERF, MYB, andWRKY were highly correlated with the key enzymes PR, MD, and (-)-limonene3-hydroxylase (L3OH) in different M. haplocalyx chemotypes (r > 0.85). Theresults indicate that these TFs regulate the variation of different chemotypes byregulating the expression patterns of PR, MD, and L3OH. The results of this studyprovide a basis for revealing the molecular mechanism of the formation ofdifferent chemotypes and offer strategies for effective breeding and metabolicengineering of different chemotypes in M. haplocalyx.","An, Xin, Wan, Jingqiong, Jiang, Hui, Liao, Yangzhen, Liu, Chang, Wei, Yuan, Wen, Chongwei, Ouyang, Zhen",2023,PeerJ,2
TA040782,10.3390/plants12101929,A Metabolome Analysis and the Immunity of Phlomis purpurea against Phytophthoracinnamomi.,"Phlomis purpurea grows spontaneously in the southern Iberian Peninsula, namely incork oak (Quercus suber) forests. In a previous transcriptome analysis, wereported on its immunity against Phytophthora cinnamomi. However, little is knownabout the involvement of secondary metabolites in the P. purpurea defenseresponse. It is known, though, that root exudates are toxic to this pathogen. Tounderstand the involvement of secondary metabolites in the defense of P.purpurea, a metabolome analysis was performed using the leaves and roots ofplants challenged with the pathogen for over 72 h. The putatively identifiedcompounds were constitutively produced. Alkaloids, fatty acids, flavonoids,glucosinolates, polyketides, prenol lipids, phenylpropanoids, sterols, andterpenoids were differentially produced in these leaves and roots along theexperiment timescale. It must be emphasized that the constitutive production oftaurine in leaves and its increase soon after challenging suggests its role in P.purpurea immunity against the stress imposed by the oomycete. The rapid increasein secondary metabolite production by this plant species accounts for a concertedaction of multiple compounds and genes on the innate protection of Phlomispurpurea against Phytophthora cinnamomi. The combination of the metabolome withthe transcriptome data previously disclosed confirms the mentioned innateimmunity of this plant against a devastating pathogen. It suggests its potentialas an antagonist in phytopathogens' biological control. Its application in greenforestry/agriculture is therefore possible.","Neves, Dina, Figueiredo, Andreia, Maia, Marisa, Laczko, Endre, Pais, Maria Salomé, Cravador, Alfredo",2023,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2

However, theprecise distribution, biosynthesis, and transcriptional regulation of taxoids andother active components in Taxus leaves remain unknown. Matrix-assisted laserdesorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging analysis was used to visualizevarious secondary metabolites in leaf sections of Taxus mairei, confirming thetissue-specific accumulation of different active metabolites. Single-cellsequencing was used to produce expression profiles of 8846 cells, with a medianof 2352 genes per cell. Based on a series of cluster-specific markers, cells weregrouped into 15 clusters, suggesting a high degree of cell heterogeneity in T.mairei leaves. Our data were used to create the first Taxus leaf metabolicsingle-cell atlas and to reveal spatial and temporal expression patterns ofseveral secondary metabolic pathways. According to the cell-type annotation, mosttaxol biosynthesis genes are expressed mainly in leaf mesophyll cells; phenolicacid and flavonoid biosynthesis genes are highly expressed in leaf epidermalcells (including the stomatal complex and guard cells); and terpenoid and steroidbiosynthesis genes are expressed specifically in leaf mesophyll cells. A numberof novel and cell-specific transcription factors involved in secondary metabolitebiosynthesis were identified, including MYB17, WRKY12, WRKY31, ERF13, GT_2, andbHLH46. Our research establishes the transcriptional landscape of major celltypes in T. mairei leaves at a single-cell resolution and provides valuableresources for studying the basic principles of cell-type-specific regulation ofsecondary metabolism.","Zhan, Xiaori, Qiu, Tian, Zhang, Hongshan, Hou, Kailin, Liang, Xueshuang, Chen, Cheng, Wang, Zhijing, Wu, Qicong, Wang, Xiaojia, Li, Xiao-Lin, Wang, Mingshuang, Feng, Shangguo, Zeng, Houqing, Yu, Chunna, Wang, Huizhong, Shen, Chenjia",2023,Plant communications,2
TA040823,10.1371/journal.pone.0281396,Effects of β-caryophyllene and oxygen availability on cholesterol and fatty acidsin breast cancer cells.,"Hypoxia is a common feature of most solid tumors, one that favors tumorprogression and limits treatment effectiveness. Targeting hypoxia has long been agoal in cancer therapy, by identifying factors that reverse or ameliorate theeffects of hypoxia on cancer cells. We, and others, have shown thatβ-caryophyllene (BCP) exhibits anti-proliferative properties in cancer cells. Wehave further shown that non-cytotoxic concentrations of BCP affect cholesteroland lipid biosynthesis in hypoxic hBrC cells at both transcriptional andtranslational levels. This led us to hypothesize that BCP may reverse the hypoxicphenotype in hBrC cells. To test this, we determined the effect of BCP on hypoxicsensitive pathways, including oxygen consumption, glycolysis, oxidative stress,cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, and ERK activation. While each of thesestudies revealed new information on the regulation by hypoxia and BCP, only thelipidomic studies showed reversal of hypoxic-dependent effects by BCP. Theselater studies showed that hypoxia-treated samples lowered monounsaturated fattyacid levels, shifting the saturation ratios of the fatty acid pools. Thissignature was ameliorated by sub-lethal concentrations of BCP, possibly throughan effect on the C:16 fatty acid saturation ratios. This is consistent withBCP-induced upregulation of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) gene, observedpreviously. This suggests that BCP may interfere with the lipid signaturemodulated by hypoxia which could have consequences for membrane biosynthesis orcomposition, both of which are important for cell replication.","Frost, Christopher J, Ramirez-Mata, Andrea, Khattri, Ram B, Merritt, Matthew E, Frost, Susan C",2023,PloS one,2
TA040850,10.3390/molecules28083614,Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents for the Extraction of Triterpene Saponins fromAralia elata var. mandshurica (Rupr. & Maxim.) J. Wen.,"The roots of the medicinal plant Aralia elata are rich in biologically activenatural products, with triterpene saponins constituting one of their majorgroups. These metabolites can be efficiently extracted by methanol and ethanol.Due to their low toxicity, natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) were recentlyproposed as promising alternative extractants for the isolation of naturalproducts from medicinal plants. However, although NADES-based extractionprotocols are becoming common in routine phytochemical work, their application inthe isolation of triterpene saponins has not yet been addressed. Therefore, here,we address the potential of NADES in the extraction of triterpene saponins fromthe roots of A. elata. For this purpose, the previously reported recoveries ofAraliacea triterpene saponins in extraction experiments with seven differentacid-based NADES were addressed by a targeted LC-MS-based quantitative approachfor, to the best of our knowledge, the first time. Thereby, 20 triterpenesaponins were annotated by their exact mass and characteristic fragmentationpatterns in the total root material, root bark and root core of A. elata byRP-UHPLC-ESI-QqTOF-MS, with 9 of them being identified in the roots of this plantfor the first time. Triterpene saponins were successfully extracted from alltested NADES, with the highest efficiency (both in terms of the numbers andrecoveries of individual analytes) achieved using a 1:1 mixture of cholinechloride and malic acid, as well as a 1:3 mixture of choline chloride and lacticacid. Thereby, for 13 metabolites, NADES were more efficient extractants incomparison with water and ethanol. Our results indicate that new, efficientNADES-based extraction protocols, giving access to high recoveries of triterpenesaponins, might be efficiently employed in laboratory practice. Thus, our dataopen the prospect of replacing alcohols with NADES in the extraction of A. elataroots.","Petrochenko, Alyona A, Orlova, Anastasia, Frolova, Nadezhda, Serebryakov, Evgeny B, Soboleva, Alena, Flisyuk, Elena V, Frolov, Andrej, Shikov, Alexander N",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

Here, we report a small subunit (SSU) ofgeranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) in Nicotiana tabacum, NtSSU II, whichtakes part in the regulation carotenoid biosynthesis by forming multipleenzymatic components with NtGGPPS1 and downstream phytoene synthase (NtPSY1).NtSSU II transcript is widely distributed in various tissues and stimulated bylow light and high light treatments. The confocal image revealed that NtSSU IIwas localized in the chloroplast. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)indicated that NtSSU II and NtGGPPS1 formed heterodimers, which were able tointeract with phytoene synthase (NtPSY1) to channel GGPP into the carotenoidproduction. CRISPR/Cas9-induced ntssu II mutant exhibited decreased leaf area andbiomass, along with a decline in carotenoid and chlorophyll accumulation.Moreover, the genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis were also downregulatedin transgenic plants of ntssu II mutant. Taken together, the newly identifiedNtSSU II could form multiple enzymatic components with NtGGPPS1 and NtPSY1 toregulate carotenoid biosynthesis in N. tabacum, in addition to the co-expressionof genes in carotenoids biosynthetic pathways.","Dong, Chen, Zhang, Mei, Song, Shanshan, Wei, Fang, Qin, Lili, Fan, Puqing, Shi, Yongchun, Wang, Xiaoran, Wang, Ran",2023,International journal of molecular sciences,2

The scientific name of citrus is Citrus L. and it belongs tothe Rutaceae family. It is one of the most important fruit crops that is grownthroughout the world. During processing, a large amount of waste is produced fromcitrus fruits in the form of peel, seeds, and pomace. Every year, the citrusprocessing industry creates a large amount of waste. The citrus waste is composedof highly bioactive substances and phytochemicals, including essential oils(EOs), ascorbic acid, sugars, carotenoids, flavonoids, dietary fiber,polyphenols, and a range of trace elements. These valuable compounds are used todevelop functional foods, including baked products, beverages, meat products, anddairy products. Moreover, these functional foods play an important role intreating various disorders, including anti-aging, anti-mutagenic, antidiabetic,anti-carcinogenic, anti-allergenic, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory,neuroprotective, and cardiovascular-protective activity. EOs are complex andcontain several naturally occurring bioactive compounds that are frequently usedas the best substitutes in the food industry.

Another possible activity of these compounds is thereduction of nervous impairment. Cannabis sativa plants are known for theirconcentration of two important terpenoids, the delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)and cannabidiol (CBD). CBD and THC have central peripheral activities alreadydescribed and their usage in different brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's andmultiple sclerosis. Aluminum (Al) is known as an important neurotoxic compound,the physiological action of Al is not known already, and in high concentrationscan lead to intoxication and cause neurotoxicity. Here we evaluated the potentialeffect of two different doses of CBD- and THC-rich based oils against Al-inducedtoxicity, in the zebrafish model. We evaluated behavioral biomarkers of the noveltank test (NTT) and social preference test (SPT), and biochemical markers: theactivity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the antioxidantenzymes-catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-S-transferase. CBD- andTHC-based oils were able to increase the AChE activity helping the cholinergicnervous system actuate against Al toxicity which was reflected by the behavioralbiomarkers changes. We concluded that the oils have a protective effect and mightbe used with proposals for neurological and antioxidant impairment avoidancecaused by Al intoxications.","Alves, Carla, Tamagno, Wagner Antonio, Vanin, Ana Paula, Pompermaier, Aline, Barcellos, Leonardo José Gil",2023,Scientific reports,2
TA040959,10.3390/molecules28186487,"Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Minor Cannabinoids CBC, THCV, and CBN in HumanMacrophages.","Inflammation is a natural response of the body to signals of tissue damage orinfection caused by pathogens. However, when it becomes imbalanced, it can leadto various disorders such as cancer, obesity, cardiovascular problems,neurological conditions, and diabetes. The endocannabinoid system, which ispresent throughout the body, plays a regulatory role in different organs andinfluences functions such as food intake, pain perception, stress response,glucose tolerance, inflammation, cell growth and specialization, and metabolism.Phytocannabinoids derived from Cannabis sativa can interact with this system andaffect its functioning. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms underlyingthe anti-inflammatory effects of three minor phytocannabinoids includingtetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabichromene (CBC), and cannabinol (CBN) usingan in vitro system. We pre-treated THP-1 macrophages with different doses ofphytocannabinoids or vehicle for one hour, followed by treating the cells with500 ng/mL of LPS or leaving them untreated for three hours. To induce the secondphase of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, LPS-treated cells were further treatedwith 5 mM ATP for 30 min. Our findings suggest that the mitigation of thePANX1/P2X7 axis plays a significant role in the anti-inflammatory effects of THCVand CBC on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Additionally, we observed that CBC andTHCV could also downregulate the IL-6/TYK-2/STAT-3 pathway. Furthermore, wediscovered that CBN may exert its inhibitory impact on the assembly of the NLRP3inflammasome by reducing PANX1 cleavage. Interestingly, we also found that theelevated ADAR1 transcript responded negatively to THCV and CBC inLPS-macrophages, indicating a potential involvement of ADAR1 in theanti-inflammatory effects of these two phytocannabinoids. THCV and CBN inhibitP-NF-κB, downregulating proinflammatory gene transcription. In summary, THCV,CBC, and CBN exert anti-inflammatory effects by influencing different stages ofgene expression: transcription, post-transcriptional regulation, translation, andpost-translational regulation.","Gojani, Esmaeel Ghasemi, Wang, Bo, Li, Dong-Ping, Kovalchuk, Olga, Kovalchuk, Igor",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA040968,10.1371/journal.pone.0277603,Volatile organic compounds influence prey composition in Sarracenia carnivorousplants.,"Sarracenia pitcher plants display interspecific differences in prey, so far onlyexplained by pitcher morphology. We hypothesized that pitcher odours play a rolein prey composition. We first compared odour and prey compositions amongSarracenia taxa grown together, forming a kinship gradient from S. purpurea knownto capture primarily ants towards S. leucophylla known to capture many flyinginsects: S. purpurea, S. X mitchelliana, and S. X Juthatip soper & S. Xleucophylla horticultural hybrids. We then measured several pitcher traits todisentangle the contributions of morphology and odour to prey variation. Thepitcher odours were as diverse as those of generalist-pollinated flowers but withnotable differences among taxa, reflecting their relatedness. VOC similarityanalyses revealed taxon specificities, that mirrored those revealed by preysimilarity analyses. S. X leucophylla stood out by being more specialised inflying insects like bees and moths and by releasing more monoterpenes known toattract flower visitors. S. X Juthatip soper trapped as many bees but fewermoths, sesquiterpenes contributing less to its scent. Ants and Diptera were themain prey of the other two with fatty-acid-derivative-dominated scents.Quantities of the different prey groups can be inferred 98% from quantities ofthe odour classes and pitcher dimensions. Two syndromes were revealed: antsassociated with fatty-acid-derivatives and short pitchers; flying insectsassociated with monoterpenes, benzenoids and tall pitchers. In S. X leucophylla,emission rate of fatty-acid-derivatives and pitcher length explained mostvariation in ant captures; monoterpenes and pitcher length explained mostvariation in bee and moth captures; monoterpenes alone explained most variationin Diptera and wasp captures. Our results suggest that odours are key factors ofthe diet composition of pitcher plants. They support the hypothesis of perceptualexploitation of insect biases in carnivorous plants and provide new insights intothe olfactory preferences of insect groups.","Dupont, Corentin, Buatois, Bruno, Bessiere, Jean-Marie, Villemant, Claire, Hattermann, Tom, Gomez, Doris, Gaume, Laurence",2023,PloS one,2

We previouslydeveloped and optimized a green extraction method for hesperidin-limonin-richlime peel extract. This study aimed to identify the metabolomics profile ofphytochemicals and the anti-cancer effects of ethanolic extract of lime (Citrusaurantifolia) peel against liver cancer cells PLC/PRF/5. The extract'smetabolomics profile was analyzed by using LC-qTOF/MS and GC-HRMS. Theanti-cancer effects were studied by using MTT assay, Annexin-PI assay, andTranswell-invasion assay. Results show that the average IC(50)(s) of hesperidin,limonin, and the extract on cancer cells' viability were 165.615, 188.073, and503.004 µg/mL, respectively. At the IC(50) levels, the extract induced moreapoptosis than those of pure compounds when incubating for 24 and 48 h (p <0.0001). A combination of limonin and hesperidin showed a synergistic effect onapoptosis induction (p < 0.001), but the effect of the combination was still lessthan that of the extract at 48 h. Furthermore, the extract significantlyinhibited cancer cell invasion better than limonin but equal to hesperidin. Atthe IC(50) level, the extract contains many folds lower amounts of hesperidin andlimonin than the IC(50) doses of the pure compounds. Besides limonin andhesperidin, there were another 60 and 22 compounds detected from the LCMS andGCMS analyses, respectively. Taken altogether, the superior effect of theethanolic extract against liver cancer cells compared to pure compound likelyresults from the combinatorial effects of limonin, hesperidin, and otherphytochemical components in the extract.","Phucharoenrak, Pakkapong, Muangnoi, Chawanphat, Trachootham, Dunyaporn",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

In thisstudy, a specific low-molecular compound named 1,8-cineole (cineole) fromCinnamomum kanehirae Hay was first reported to have remarkably promoted theasexual sporulation of A. cinnamomea in submerged fermentation (AcSmF). Then, RNAsequencing, real-time quantitative PCR, and a literature review were performed topredict the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying the cineole-promotedsporulation of AcSmF. The available evidence supports the hypothesis that afterreceiving the signal of cineole through cell receptors Wsc1 and Mid2, Pkc1promoted the expression levels of rlm1 and wetA and facilitated their transfer tothe cell wall integrity (CWI) signal pathway, and wetA in turn promoted thesporulation of AcSmF. Moreover, cineole changed the membrane functional state ofthe A. cinnamomea cell and thus activated the heat stress response by the CWIpathway. Then, heat shock protein 90 and its chaperone Cdc37 promoted theexpression of stuA and brlA, thus promoting sporulation of AcSmF.

The six agronomic traits of fruit flesh color, fruit shape,fruit hairiness, flower type, pollen sterility, and soluble solids content, alongwith 14 key volatile odor compounds (VOCs), were recorded formultiple-statistical GWAS. Except the reported candidate genes, six novel geneswere identified as associated with these traits. Thirty-nine significant SNPswere associated with eight VOCs. The putative candidate genes were confirmed forVOCs by RNA-seq, including three genes in the biosynthesis pathway found to beassociated with linalool, soluble solids content, and cis-3-hexenyl acetate.Multiple-trait genomic prediction enhanced the predictive ability forγ-decalactone to 0.7415 compared with the single-trait model value of 0.1017.

Various phytochemical studies have offered valuable insights into thechemistry of Helichrysum plants, hinting at bioactive components that define themedicinal properties of the plant. However, there are still knowledge gapsregarding the size and diversity of the Helichrysum chemical space. As such,continuous efforts are needed to comprehensively characterize the phytochemistryof Helichrysum, which will subsequently contribute to the discovery andexploration of Helichrysum-derived natural products for drug discovery. Thus,reported herein is a computational metabolomics work to comprehensivelycharacterize the metabolic landscape of the medicinal herb Helichrysumsplendidum, which is less studied. Metabolites were methanol-extracted andanalyzed on a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system.Spectral data were mined using molecular networking (MN) strategies. The resultsrevealed that the metabolic map of H. splendidum is chemically diverse, withchemical superclasses that include organic polymers, benzenoids, lipid andlipid-like molecules, alkaloids, and derivatives, phenylpropanoids andpolyketides. These results point to a vastly rich chemistry with potentialbioactivities, and the latter was demonstrated through computationally assessingthe binding of selected metabolites with CDK-2 and CCNB1 anti-cancer targets.Molecular docking results showed that flavonoids (luteolin, dihydroquercetin, andisorhamnetin) and terpenoids (tiliroside and silybin) interact strongly with theCDK-2 and CCNB1 targets. Thus, this work suggests that these flavonoid andterpenoid compounds from H. splendidum are potentially anti-cancer agents throughtheir ability to interact with these proteins involved in cancer pathways andprogression. As such, these actionable insights are a necessary step for furtherexploration and translational studies for H. splendidum-derived compounds fordrug discovery.","Lephatsi, Motseoa Mariam, Choene, Mpho Susan, Kappo, Abidemi Paul, Madala, Ntakadzeni Edwin, Tugizimana, Fidele",2023,Metabolites,2
TA041223,10.38212/2224-6614.3452,Chemical transformation of cannabidiol into psychotropic cannabinoids underacidic reaction conditions: Identification of transformed products by GC-MS.,"Recently, cannabidiol (CBD), one of the major components of the Cannabis species,has been a focus in the cannabis industry due to its various pharmacologicaleffects. Interestingly, CBD can be converted into several psychoactivecannabinoids, such as 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC) and its structuralisomers, under acidic reaction conditions. In this study, chemical transformationof CBD in ethanol solution was conducted with variation in pH at 2.0, 3.5, and5.0 by addition of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). These resulting solutions werederivatized with trimethylsilyl (TMS) reagent and analyzed using GC/MS-scan mode.Time profiles of CBD degradation and transformation of products were examinedaccording to variations in pH and temperature. Several transformed productsproduced after the acidic reaction of CBD were identified by matching retentiontimes and mass spectra to authentic standards. Regarding the identification ofproducts without authentic standards, the EI-mass spectra of suchcannabinoid-OTMS derivatives were interpreted according to structural class,suggesting mass fragmentation pathways. From the GC/MS data, Δ(9)-THC, CBC, andethoxy-hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) analogs were shown to be major components, andTHC isomers (Δ(8)- and Δ(10)-THCs) and 9-hydroxy-HHC were observed as minorcomponents. Using time profile data, the acidity of the reaction solution was animportant factor in degradation of CBD. Degradation of CBD and formation of THCrarely occurred at pH 5.0, even at 70 °C with a long process time of 24 h. Incontrast, degradation of CBD occurred readily at pH 3.5 and 30 °C over a shortprocess time and was further accelerated by lowering pH, increasing temperature,and lengthening the process time. Based on profile data and identifiedtransformed products, formation pathways from the degradation of CBD under acidicreaction conditions are suggested. Among the transformed products, sevencomponents are known to have psychoactive effects. Thus, industrial CBDmanufacturing processes in food and cosmetic products should be carefullycontrolled. These results will provide important guidelines on the control ofmanufacturing processes, storage, fermentation processes, and new regulation inindustrial applications of CBD.","Jeong, Minsun, Lee, Sangin, Seo, Chaeyoung, Kwon, Eunjeong, Rho, Soohyang, Cho, Mansoo, Kim, Moon Yeon, Lee, Wonwoong, Lee, Yong Sup, Hong, Jongki",2023,Journal of food and drug analysis,2
TA041226,10.1007/s00425-023-04248-3,Generation and physiological characterization of genome-edited Nicotianabenthamiana plants containing zeaxanthin as the only leaf xanthophyll.,"Simultaneous genome editing of the two homeologous LCYe and ZEP genes ofNicotiana benthamiana results in plants in which all xanthophylls are replaced byzeaxanthin. Plant carotenoids act both as photoreceptors and photoprotectants inphotosynthesis and as precursors of apocarotenoids, which include signalingmolecules such as abscisic acid (ABA). As dietary components, the xanthophyllslutein and zeaxanthin have photoprotective functions in the human macula. Wedeveloped transient and stable combinatorial genome editing methods, followed bydirect LC-MS screening for zeaxanthin accumulation, for the simultaneous genomeediting of the two homeologous Lycopene Epsilon Cyclase (LCYe) and the twoZeaxanthin Epoxidase (ZEP) genes present in the allopolyploid Nicotianabenthamiana genome. Editing of the four genes resulted in plants in which allleaf xanthophylls were substituted by zeaxanthin, but with different ABA levelsand growth habits, depending on the severity of the ZEP1 mutation. Inhigh-zeaxanthin lines, the abundance of the major photosystem II antenna LHCIIwas reduced with respect to wild-type plants and the LHCII trimeric state becameunstable upon thylakoid solubilization. Consistent with the depletion in LHCII,edited plants underwent a compensatory increase in PSII/PSI ratios and a loss ofthe large-size PSII supercomplexes, while the level of PSI-LHCI supercomplex wasunaffected. Reduced activity of the photoprotective mechanism NPQ was shown inhigh-zeaxanthin plants, while PSII photoinhibition was similar for all genotypesupon exposure to excess light, consistent with the antioxidant andphotoprotective role of zeaxanthin in vivo.","Sulli, Maria, Dall'Osto, Luca, Ferrante, Paola, Guardini, Zeno, Gomez, Rodrigo Lionel, Mini, Paola, Demurtas, Olivia Costantina, Aprea, Giuseppe, Nicolia, Alessandro, Bassi, Roberto, Giuliano, Giovanni",2023,Planta,2
TA041309,10.1128/spectrum.00069-23,Roles of Two Phytoene Synthases and Orange Protein in Carotenoid Metabolism ofthe β-Carotene-Accumulating Dunaliella salina.,"Phytoene synthase (PSY) is a key enzyme in carotenoid metabolism and oftenregulated by orange protein. However, few studies have focused on the functionaldifferentiation of the two PSYs and their regulation by protein interaction inthe β-carotene-accumulating Dunaliella salina CCAP 19/18. In this study, weconfirmed that DsPSY1 from D. salina possessed high PSY catalytic activity,whereas DsPSY2 almost had no activity. Two amino acid residues at positions 144and 285 responsible for substrate binding were associated with the functionalvariance between DsPSY1 and DsPSY2. Moreover, orange protein from D. salina(DsOR) could interact with DsPSY1/2. DbPSY from Dunaliella sp. FACHB-847 also hadhigh PSY activity, but DbOR could not interact with DbPSY, which might be onereason why it could not highly accumulate β-carotene. Overexpression of DsOR,especially the mutant DsOR(His), could significantly improve the single-cellcarotenoid content and change cell morphology (with larger cell size, biggerplastoglobuli, and fragmented starch granules) of D. salina. Overall, DsPSY1played a dominant role in carotenoid biosynthesis in D. salina, and DsOR promotedcarotenoid accumulation, especially β-carotene via interacting with DsPSY1/2 andregulating the plastid development. Our study provides a new clue for theregulatory mechanism of carotenoid metabolism in Dunaliella. IMPORTANCE Phytoenesynthase (PSY) as the key rate-limiting enzyme in carotenoid metabolism can beregulated by various regulators and factors. We found that DsPSY1 played adominant role in carotenogenesis in the β-carotene-accumulating Dunaliellasalina, and two amino acid residues critical in the substrate binding wereassociated with the functional variance between DsPSY1 and DsPSY2. Orange proteinfrom D. salina (DsOR) can promote carotenoid accumulation via interacting withDsPSY1/2 and regulating the plastid development, which provides new insights intothe molecular mechanism of massive accumulation of β-carotene in D. salina.","Liang, Ming-Hua, Xie, Shan-Rong, Dai, Jv-Liang, Chen, Hao-Hong, Jiang, Jian-Guo",2023,Microbiology spectrum,2

Intramolecular singlet fission has beensuggested to occur on individual carotenoid molecules within protein complexesprovided that the conjugated backbone is twisted out of plane. However, thishypothesis has been forwarded only in protein complexes containing multiplecarotenoids and bacteriochlorophylls in close contact. To test the hypothesis ontwisted carotenoids in a ""minimal"" one-carotenoid system, we study the orangecarotenoid protein (OCP). OCP exists in two forms: in its orange form (OCPo), thesingle bound carotenoid is twisted, whereas in its red form (OCPr), thecarotenoid is planar. To enable room-temperature spectroscopy oncanthaxanthin-binding OCPo and OCPr without laser-induced photoconversion, wetrap them in a trehalose glass. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we showthat there is no evidence of long-lived triplet generation through intramolecularsinglet fission despite the canthaxanthin twist in OCPo.","Sutherland, George A, Pidgeon, James P, Lee, Harrison Ka Hin, Proctor, Matthew S, Hitchcock, Andrew, Wang, Shuangqing, Chekulaev, Dimitri, Tsoi, Wing Chung, Johnson, Matthew P, Hunter, C Neil, Clark, Jenny",2023,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2

Therefore, there is an urgentneed for pharmacotherapeutic drugs to treat obesity. We performed a screeningassay using natural products with anti-adipogenic properties in 3T3-L1 cells anddetermined that tschimganidine, a terpenoid from the Umbelliferae family,inhibited adipogenesis. To evaluate the anti-obesity effects of tschimganidine invivo. Mice were fed either a normal chow diet (NFD) or a high-fat chow diet (HFD)with or without tschimganidine for 12 weeks. Treatment with tschimganidinedecreased lipid accumulation and adipogenesis, accompanied by reduced expressionof adipogenesis and lipid accumulation-related factors. Tschimganidinesignificantly increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase(AMPK) and decreased that of AKT. Depletion of AMPK relieved the reduction inlipid accumulation resulting from tschimganidine treatment. Moreover,tschimganidine administration drastically reduced the weight and size of bothgonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) and blood glucose levels in high-fatdiet-induced obese mice. We suggest that tschimganidine is a potent antiobesityagent, which impedes adipogenesis and improves glucose homeostasis.Tschimganidine can then be evaluated for clinical application as a therapeuticagent.

Due to the extensive use ofcommercial fungicides, fungicide-resistant strains have emerged. Naturalcompounds with antifungal properties are widely present in various kinds oforganisms. Perillaldehyde (PA), derived from the plant species Perillafrutescens, is generally recognized as a potent antimicrobial substance and to besafe to humans and the environment. In this study, we demonstrated that PA couldsignificantly inhibit the mycelial growth of B. cinerea and reduced itspathogenicity on tomato leaves. We also found that PA had a significantprotective effect on tomato, grape, and strawberry. The antifungal mechanism ofPA was investigated by measuring the reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation,the intracellular Ca(2+) level, the mitochondrial membrane potential, DNAfragmentation, and phosphatidylserine exposure. Further analyses revealed that PApromoted protein ubiquitination and induced autophagic activities and thentriggered protein degradation. When the two metacaspase genes, BcMca1 and BcMca2,were knocked out from B. cinerea, all mutants did not exhibit reduced sensitivityto PA. These findings demonstrated that PA could induce metacaspase-independentapoptosis in B. cinerea. Based on our results, we proposed that PA could be usedas an effective control agent for gray mold management. IMPORTANCE Botrytiscinerea causes gray mold disease, is considered one of the most importantdangerous pathogens worldwide, and leads to severe economic losses worldwide. Dueto the lack of resistant varieties of B. cinerea, gray mold control has mainlyrelied on application of synthetic fungicides. However, long-term and extensiveuse of synthetic fungicides has increased fungicide resistance in B. cinerea andis harmful to humans and the environment. In this study, we found thatperillaldehyde has a significant protective effect on tomato, grape, andstrawberry. We further characterized the antifungal mechanism of PA on B.cinerea.

TA041820,10.2147/DDDT.S411408,Ursolic Acid Ameliorated Neuronal Damage by Restoring Microglia-ActivatedMMP/TIMP Imbalance in vitro.,"PURPOSE: The oxygen and glucose deprivation-reoxygenation (OGDR) model is widelyused to evaluate ischemic stroke and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injuryin vitro. Excessively activated microglia produce pro-inflammatory mediators suchas matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs] and their specific inhibitors, tissueinhibitors of metalloproteinases [TIMPs], causing neuronal damage. Ursolic acid(UA) acts as a neuroprotective agent in the rat middle cerebral arteryocclusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model keeping the MMP/TIMP balance with underlyingmechanisms unclear. Our study used OGDR model to determine whether and how UAreduces neuronal damage by reversing MMP/TIMP imbalance caused by microglia inI/R injury in vitro. METHODS: SH-SY5Y cells were first cultured with 95% N(2) and5% CO(2) and then cultivated regularly for OGDR model. Cell viability was testedfor a proper UA dose. We established a co-culture system with SH-SY5Y cells andmicroglia-conditioned medium (MCM) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) andinterferon-gamma (IFNγ). MMP9 and TIMP1 levels were measured with ELISA assay toconfirm the UA effect. We added recombinant MMP9 (rMMP9) and TIMP1 neutralizingantibody (anti-TIMP1) for reconfirmation. Transmission electron microscopy wasused to observe cell morphology, and flow cytometry and Annexin V-FITC and PIlabeling for apoptotic conditions. We further measured the calcium fluorescenceintensity in SH-SY5Y cells. RESULTS: The MCM significantly reduced cell viabilityof SH-SY5Y cells after OGDR (p<0.01), which was restored by UA (0.25 µM)(p<0.05), whereas lactate dehydrogenase activity, intraneuronal Ca(2+)concentration, and apoptosis-related indexes were showed significant improvementafter UA treatment (p<0.01). UA corrected the MMP/TIMP imbalance by decreasingMMP9 expression and increasing TIMP1 expression in the co-culture system (p<0.01)and the effects of UA on SH-SY5Y cells were mitigated by the administration ofrMMP9 and anti-TIMP1 (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that UA inhibitedmicroglia-induced neuronal cell death in an OGDR model of ischemic reperfusioninjury by stabilizing the MMP9/TIMP1 imbalance.","Qiu, Luying, Wang, Yaxuan, Wang, Yuye, Liu, Fang, Deng, Shumin, Xue, Weishuang, Wang, Yanzhe",2023,"Drug design, development and therapy",2

Thehydroxyl groups of its structure have a chemical affinity to form hydrogels,which favors the association with biologically active molecules, such asnerolidol. This association improves the biological properties and allows thematerial to be used in drug delivery systems. Chicha gum hydrogels associatedwith nerolidol were produced at two concentrations: 0.01 and 0.02 g mL(-1). Then,the hydrogels were characterized by thermogravimetry (TG), Fourier TransformInfrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and rheological analysis. The antibacterialactivity was tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Thecytotoxicity was evaluated against Artemia salina. Finally, an in vivo healingassay was carried out. The infrared characterization indicated that interactionswere formed during the gel reticulation. This implies the presence of nerolidolin the regions at 3100-3550 cm(-1). The rheological properties changed with anincreasing concentration of nerolidol, which resulted in less viscous materials.An antibacterial 83.6% growth inhibition effect was observed using the hydrogelwith 0.02 g mL(-1) nerolidol. The in vivo healing assay showed the practicalactivity of the hydrogels in the wound treatment, as the materials promotedefficient re-epithelialization. Therefore, it was concluded that the chichahydrogels have the potential to be used as wound-healing products.","Lima, Idglan Sá de, Ferreira, Maria Onaira Gonçalves, Barros, Esmeralda Maria Lustosa, Rizzo, Marcia Dos Santos, Santos, Jailson de Araújo, Ribeiro, Alessandra Braga, Anteveli Osajima Furtini, Josy, C Silva-Filho, Edson, Estevinho, Leticia M",2023,International journal of molecular sciences,2

In this study, thirty EOs at 0.5mg/mL were evaluated for in vitro growth inhibition of the main postharvestfungi, which are Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, and Penicilliumitalicum. Cinnamomum verrum EO completely inhibited the mycelial growth of A.alternata and B. cinerea, and Syzygium aromaticum EO completely inhibited themycelia of A. alternata. B. cinerea mycelial growth was completely inhibited byGautheria fragrantissima, Cymbopogon nardus, Pelargonium asperum, and Cupressussempervirens EOs. G. fragrantissima EO inhibited the mycelia growth of P.italicum by 98%. Overall, B. cinerea displayed the highest sensitivity to EOsthan P. italicum and A. alternata. G. fragrantissima, C. sempervirens, C. nardus,P. asperum, Mentha piperita, Foeniculum vulgare, C. verrum, and S. aromaticum EOsshowed the highest inhibition for these three pathogens. Minimum inhibitoryconcentrations were lower for C. verrum and S. aromaticum EOs, ranging between0.31 and 0.45 mg/mL and 0.37 to 0.57 mg/mL, respectively, against the threepathogens.

Patchouli alcohol is the principalbioactive constituent of its volatile oil. In China, patchouli is typicallycategorized into two types: patchoulol-type (PA-type) and pogostone-type(PO-type). The study evaluated physiological and biochemical indicators,phytohormone metabolites and conducted transcriptome and proteome analyses onboth two chemotypes. The PA-type exhibited higher levels of chlorophyll a, b, andcarotenoids than the PO-type. In total, 35 phytohormone metabolites representingcytokinin, abscisic acid, gibberellin, jasmonic acid, and their derivatives wereidentified using UPLC-MS/MS, 10 of which displayed significant differences,mainly belong to cytokinins and jasmonates. Transcriptome analysis identified4,799 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while proteome analysis identified150 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Regarding the transcriptomeresults, the DEGs of the PO-type showed significant downregulation in thepathways of photosynthesis, photosynthesis-antenna protein, porphyrin andchlorophyll metabolism, carotenoid biosynthesis, sesquiterpene and triterpenoidbiosynthesis, and starch and sucrose metabolism, but upregulation in the pathwayof zeatin synthesis. A combination of transcriptome and proteome analysesrevealed that the DEGs and DEPs of lipoxygenase (LOX2), β-glucosidase, andpatchouli synthase (PTS) were collectively downregulated, while the DEGs and DEPsof Zeatin O-xylosyltransferase (ZOX1) and α-amylase (AMY) were jointlyupregulated in the PO-type compared to the PA-type. Differential levels ofphytohormones, variations in photosynthetic efficiency, and differentialexpression of genes in the sesquiterpene synthesis pathway may account for themorphological and major active component differences between the two chemotypesof patchouli. The findings of this study offer novel perspectives on theunderlying mechanisms contributing to the formation of the two patchoulichemotypes.","Zhang, Hongyi, Ou, Xiaohua, Chen, Wenyi, Zeng, Qing, Yan, Yaling, He, Mengling, Yan, Hanjing",2023,PloS one,2

Here, we evaluated the cytotoxicactivity of EO from Lippia alba (chemotype linalool), L. alba (chemotypedihydrocarvone, LaDEO), Clinopodium nepeta (L.) Kuntze (CnEO), Eucalyptusglobulus, Origanum × paniculatum, Mentha × piperita, Mentha arvensis L., andRosmarinus officinalis L. against human lung (A549) and colon (HCT-116) cancercells. The cells were treated with increasing EO concentrations (0-500 µL/L) for24 h, and cytotoxic activity was assessed. LaDEO and CnEO were the most potentEOs evaluated (IC(50) range, 145-275 µL/L). The gas chromatography-massspectrometry method was used to determine their composition. Considering EOlimitations as therapeutic agents (poor water solubility, volatilization, andoxidation), we evaluated whether LaDEO and CnEO encapsulation into solid lipidnanoparticles (SLN/EO) enhanced their anticancer activity. Highly stablespherical SLN/LaDEO and SLN/CnEO SLN/EO were obtained, with a mean diameter of140-150 nm, narrow size dispersion, and Z potential around -5mV. EO encapsulationstrongly increased their anticancer activity, particularly in A549 cells exposedto SLN/CnEO (IC(50) = 66 µL/L CnEO). The physicochemical characterization,biosafety, and anticancer mechanisms of SLN/CnEO were also evaluated in A549cells. SLN/CnEO containing 97 ± 1% CnEO was highly stable for up to 6 months. Anincreased in vitro CnEO release from SLN at an acidic pH (endolysosomalcompartment) was observed. SLN/CnEO proved to be safe against blood componentsand non-toxic for normal WI-38 cells at therapeutic concentrations.

Three clerodane diterpene compounds were isolated andidentified as being responsible for the antiplasmodial activity of the leaves ofthe plant: caseamembrin T (1), corybulosin I (2), and isocaseamembrin E (3),which exhibited half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 0.25 to 0.51µg/mL. These compounds were tested on two other parasites, Leishmania mexicanamexicana and Trypanosoma brucei brucei, to identify possible selectivity in oneof them. Although these products possess both antileishmanial andantitrypanosomal properties, they displayed selectivity for the malaria parasite,with a selectivity index between 6 and 12 regarding antitrypanosomal activity andbetween 25 and 100 regarding antileishmanial activity. These compounds weretested on three cell lines, breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, pulmonaryadenocarcinoma cells A549, and pancreatic carcinoma cells PANC-1, to evaluatetheir selectivity towards Plasmodium. This has not enabled us to establishselectivity for Plasmodium, but has revealed the promising activity of compounds1-3 (IC(50) < 2 µg/mL), particularly against pancreatic carcinoma cells (IC(50) <1 µg/mL).

TA041930,10.1016/j.phymed.2023.154708,Effect of andrographolide and deep eutectic solvent extracts of Andrographispaniculata on human coronavirus organ culture 43 (HCoV-OC43).,"BACKGROUND: Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees has demonstrated potentialfor treating infections caused by coronaviruses. However, no antiviral activityof andrographolide or A. paniculata extracts against human coronavirus organculture 43 (HCoV-OC43) has been reported. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluatethe anti-HCoV-OC43 effect of andrographolide and A. paniculata as well as thecorrelation between andrographolide concentration and the anti-HCoV-OC43 activityof A. paniculata extracts. METHODS: This study evaluated and compared the invitro anti-HCoV-OC43 activities of various A. paniculata extracts andandrographolide. To obtain A. paniculata extracts with different concentrationsof andrographolide and its components, methanol and deep eutectic solvents (DES)were used to extract the aerial parts of A. paniculata. Andrographolide contentwas determined using UV-HPLC, and antiviral activity was assessed in HCT-8 coloncells. RESULTS: The methanol and five acidic DES (containing malic acid or citricacid) extracts of A. paniculata exerted anti-HCoV-OC43 activity. Antiviralactivity had a moderately strong positive linear relationship (r = 0.7938) withandrographolide content. Although the methanol extract contained the highestandrographolide content (2.34 mg/ml), its anti-HCoV-OC43 activity was lower thanthat of the DES extracts containing lower andrographolide concentrations(0.92-1.46 mg/ml). CONCLUSION: Methanol and the five acidic DES extracts of A.paniculata exhibited anti-HCoV-OC43 activity. However, the in vitro antiviralactivity of A. paniculata extracts did not have a very strong positive linearrelationship (r < 0.8) with andrographolide concentration in the extract. As aresult, when comparing A. paniculata extracts, the anti-HCoV-OC43 test couldprovide a different result from the andrographolide concentration determination.","Komaikul, Jukrapun, Ruangdachsuwan, Sasiporn, Wanlayaporn, Duangnapa, Palabodeewat, Somnuek, Punyahathaikul, Surat, Churod, Theeraporn, Choonong, Rattanathorn, Kitisripanya, Tharita",2023,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2

Considering the widepharmacological potential of monoterpenes, including their antioxidant activity,this study aimed to evaluate menthofuran-gastroprotective activity, as well asthe involvement of antioxidant mechanisms in this effect. The acute toxicity wasevaluated according to the fixed dose method. The antiulcerogenic activity wasinvestigated by using experimental models of gastric ulcers induced by ethanol,indomethacin, and ischemia/reperfusion in rats. The antisecretory gastricactivity, the catalase activity, and the gastric wall mucus were determined inpylorus ligated rats. Gastric wall nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) group content,myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evaluatedin ethanol-induced the gastric ulcer model. Menthofuran (2 g/kg) presented lowacute toxicity and showed gastroprotective activity against ethanol-,indomethacin-, and ischemia/reperfusion-induced ulcers. Moreover, menthofuranpresented antisecretory activity, reduced the total acidity, and increased pH ofgastric secretion. On the other hand, a decrease in mucus content of gastric wallwithout alteration of gastric juice volume and catalase activity was observed.Interestingly, menthofuran increased NPSH levels and reduced MDA levels and MPOactivity. Gastroprotective effects of menthofuran appear to be mediated, at leastin part, by the NOS pathway, endogenous prostaglandins, reduced gastric juiceacidity, increased concentration of the NPSH groups, and reduced lipidicperoxidation. These findings support the menthofuran as an effectivegastroprotective agent, as well as the marked participation of antioxidantmechanisms in this response.","Alves, Naira Moura, Nunes, Paulo Humberto Moreira, Mendes Garcez, Anderson, Lima de Freitas, Manoela Carine, Oliveira, Irisdalva Sousa, da Silva, Francilene Vieira, Fernandes, Hélio de Barros, de Sousa, Damião Pergentino, Oliveira, Rita de Cássia Meneses, Arcanjo, Daniel Dias Rufino, Martins, Maria do Carmo de Carvalho E",2023,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2

However, westill find some GC organoids are insensitive to AIL. We have done some sequencinganalysis and found that the insensitive strains are highly expressed in PARP1. Inthis study, we investigated whether AIL can enhance the anti-tumour effect ofPARPi in GC. CCK8 and spheroid colony formation assay were used to measureanti-tumour effects. SynergyFinder software was used to calculate the synergyscore of the drug combination and flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis.Western blot, IHC, IF tests were used to measure protein expression. Finally,nude mouse xenograft models were used to verify the in vitro mechanisms. Highexpression of PARP1 was found to be the cause of drug insensitivity. When AIL ispaired with a PARP1 inhibitor, olaparib (OLP), drug sensitivity improves. Wediscovered that this combination functions by blocking off HSP90-BRCA1interaction and inhibiting the activity of PARP1, thus in turn inhibiting thehomologous recombination deficiency and base excision repair pathway to finallyachieve synthetic lethality through increased sensitivity. Moreover, P23 canregulate BRCA1 in GC in vitro. This study proves that the inhibitory effect ofAIL on BRCA1 allowed even cancer cells with normal BRCA1 function to be sensitiveto PARP inhibitors when it is simultaneously administered with OLP.

Giventhe potential of essential oil (EO) in improving animal performance and improvingfeed palatability, we hypothesized that dietary supplementation of cinnamaldehydeand carvacrol could improve performance and appetite of nursery pigs bymodulating intestinal health and microbiota. Cinnamaldehyde (100 mg/kg),carvacrol (100 mg/kg), and their mixtures (including 50 mg/kg cinnamaldehyde and50 mg/kg carvacrol) were supplemented into the diets of 240 nursery pigs for42 d, and data related to performance were measured. Thereafter, the influence ofEO on intestinal health, appetite and gut microbiota and their correlations wereexplored. EO supplementation increased (P < 0.05) the body weight, average dailygain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) of piglets, and reduced(P < 0.05) diarrhea rates in nursery pigs. Furthermore, EO increased (P < 0.05)the intestinal absorption area and the abundance of tight junction proteins, anddecreased (P < 0.05) intestinal permeability and local inflammation. In terms ofintestinal development and the mucus barrier, EO promoted intestinal developmentand increased (P < 0.05) the number of goblet cells.

TA042381,10.1111/pbi.13870,Genome sequencing reveals chromosome fusion and extensive expansion of genesrelated to secondary metabolism in Artemisia argyi.,"Artemisia argyi, as famous as Artemisia annua, is a medicinal plant with hugeeconomic value in the genus of Artemisia and has been widely used in the worldfor about 3000 years. However, a lack of the reference genome severely hindersthe understanding of genetic basis for the active ingredient synthesis of A.argyi. Here, we firstly report a complex chromosome-level genome assembly of A.argyi with a large size of 8.03 Gb, with features of high heterozygosity (2.36%),high repetitive sequences (73.59%) and a huge number of protein-coding genes(279 294 in total). The assembly reveals at least three rounds of whole-genomeduplication (WGD) events, including a recent WGD event in the A. argyi genome,and a recent burst of transposable element, which may contribute to its largegenome size. The genomic data and karyotype analyses confirmed that A. argyi isan allotetraploid with 34 chromosomes. Intragenome synteny analysis revealed thatchromosomes fusion event occurred in the A. argyi genome, which elucidates thechanges in basic chromosome numbers in Artemisia genus. Significant expansion ofgenes related to photosynthesis, DNA replication, stress responses and secondarymetabolism were identified in A. argyi, explaining the extensive environmentaladaptability and rapid growth characteristics. In addition, we analysed genesinvolved in the biosynthesis pathways of flavonoids and terpenoids, and foundthat extensive gene amplification and tandem duplication contributed to the highcontents of metabolites in A. argyi. Overall, the reference genome assemblyprovides scientific support for evolutionary biology, functional genomics andbreeding in A. argyi and other Artemisia species.","Miao, Yuhuan, Luo, Dandan, Zhao, Tingting, Du, Hongzhi, Liu, Zhenhua, Xu, Zhongping, Guo, Lanping, Chen, Changjie, Peng, Sainan, Li, Jin Xin, Ma, Lin, Ning, Guogui, Liu, Dahui, Huang, Luqi",2022,Plant biotechnology journal,2
TA042398,10.3390/molecules27061942,Evaluation of Vetiver Volatile Compound Production under Aeroponic-GrownConditions for the Perfume Industry.,"Vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Roberty) is a major tropical perfume crop.Access to its essential oil (EO)-filled roots is nevertheless cumbersome andland-damaging. This study, therefore, evaluated the potential of vetivercultivation under soilless high-pressure aeroponics (HPA) for volatile organiccompound (VOC) production. The VOC accumulation in the roots was investigated bytransmission electron microscopy, and the composition of these VOCs was analyzedby gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) after sampling byheadspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME). The HPA-grown plants werecompared to plants that had been grown in potting soil and under axenicconditions. The HPA-grown plants were stunted, demonstrating less root biomassthan the plants that had been grown in potting soil. The roots were slender,thinner, more tapered, and lacked the typical vetiver fragrance. HPA cultivationmassively impaired the accumulation of the less-volatile hydrocarbon andoxygenated sesquiterpenes that normally form most of the VOCs. The axenic,tissue-cultured plants followed a similar and more exacerbated trend.Ultrastructural analyses revealed that the HPA conditions altered root ontogeny,whereby the roots contained fewer EO-accumulating cells and hosted fewer and moreimmature intracellular EO droplets. These preliminary results allowed to concludethat HPA-cultivated vetiver suffers from altered development and root ontologydisorders that prevent EO accumulation.","Gavira, Carole, Watteau, Françoise, Lainé, Jean-Marc, Bourgaud, Frédéric, Legendre, Laurent",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

Tree peony (Paeonia × suffruticosa) originates in the Pan-Himalaya andhas nine wild species divided into two subsections, Delavayanae and Vaginatae.Their flowers are beloved worldwide for their sweet floral fragrance, yet theflavor-related volatiles and underlying biosynthetic pathways remain unknown.Here, we characterized the volatile blends of all wild tree peony species andfound that the flavor-related volatiles were highly divergent, but linalool was aunique monoterpene in subsect. Delavayanae. Further detection of volatiles in 97cultivars with various genetic backgrounds showed that linalool was also thecharacteristic aroma component in Paeonia delavayi hybrid progenies, suggestingthat linalool was conserved and dominant within subsect. Delavayanae and itshybrids, instead of species and cultivars from subsect. Vaginatae. Globaltranscriptome analysis of all wild tree peony species and 60 cultivars revealedfive candidate genes that may be involved in key steps of linalool biosynthesis;especially the expressions of three TPS genes, PdTPS1, PdTPS2, and PdTPS4, weresignificantly positively correlated with linalool emissions across tree peonycultivars. Further biochemical evidence demonstrated that PdTPS1 and PdTPS4 werethe pivotal genes determining the species-specific and cultivar-specific emissionof linalool. This study revealed a new insight into floral scent divergence intree peony and would greatly facilitate our understanding of the phylogeny andevolution of Paeonia.","Li, Shanshan, Zhang, Ling, Sun, Miao, Lv, Mengwen, Yang, Yong, Xu, Wenzhong, Wang, Liangsheng",2023,Horticulture research,2

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of monoterpenesynthesis remains poorly understood. In this study, the content of three mainmonoterpenes (linalool, ocimene, and myrcene) was examined in Lilium 'Siberia',and RNA sequencing of the 11 stages of flower development was conducted. Thebiosynthesis of the three monoterpenes increased with flower development,reaching their peak levels at the full flowering stage. Transcriptome datarevealed 257,140 unigenes, with an average size of 794 bp, from which 43,934differentially expressed genes were identified and enriched in the KEGG pathwayspartly involved in plant hormone signal transduction and monoterpenoidbiosynthesis. Furthermore, the essential factor LiMYB305 was identified by WGCNAafter the release of the flower fragrance. The transient silencing of LiMYB305 inpetals using VIGS technology showed that the mRNA expression levels of LiLiS,LiOcS, and LiMyS were significantly downregulated and that the release oflinalool, ocimene, and myrcene had decreased significantly. Y1H, LUC, and EMSAexperiments revealed that LiMYB305 directly bound and activated the LiOcSpromoter to increase the synthesis of monoterpenes. Taken together, these resultsprovide insight into the molecular mechanism of monoterpene synthesis and providevaluable information to investigate the formation of the flower fragrance inLilium.","Yang, Yun-Yao, Ma, Bo, Li, Ying-Ying, Han, Ming-Zheng, Wu, Jing, Zhou, Xiao-Feng, Tian, Ji, Wang, Wen-He, Leng, Ping-Sheng, Hu, Zeng-Hui",2022,Frontiers in plant science,2

To thisend, the oil was verified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry(GC/MS). Candida strains were used for antifungal assays by means of the serialmicrodilution technique, in order to determine the average inhibitoryconcentration (IC(50)), and for the modification assays, sub-inhibitoryconcentrations (MIC/8) were used. Finally, the natural product's ability toinhibit the formation of filamentous structures was evaluated. In antibacterialtests, the MIC of the oil against strains of Staphylococcus aureus andEscherichia coli and its modifying effects in association with gentamicin,erythromycin, and norfloxacin were determined. The major constituent of theessential oil was the monoterpene myrcene (54.71%). The results show that theessential oil has an antifungal effect, with C. albicans strains being the mostsusceptible. Furthermore, the oil can potentiate the effect of fluconazoleagainst strains of C. tropicalis and C. albicans. Regarding its effect onmicromorphology, the oil was also able to inhibit the filaments in all strains.In combination with antibiotics, the oil potentiated the drug's action byreducing the MIC against E. coli and S. aureus.

The aim of this work was to select EOs able to downregulate STAT3signaling using Western blot and RT-PCR analyses. The molecular mechanism ofanti-STAT3 activity was evaluated through spectrophotometric and fluorometricanalyses, and the biological effect of STAT3 inhibition was analyzed by flowcytometry and wound healing assay. Herein, Pinus mugo EO (PMEO) is identified asan inhibitor of constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation in human prostate cancercells, DU145. The down-modulation of the STAT3 signaling cascade decreased theexpression of anti-proliferative as well as anti-apoptotic genes and proteins,leading to the inhibition of cell migration and apoptotic cell death. PMEOtreatment induced a rapid drop in glutathione (GSH) levels and an increase inreactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, resulting in mild oxidative stress.Pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a cell-permeable ROSscavenger, reverted the inhibitory action of PMEO on STAT3 phosphorylation.Moreover, combination therapy revealed that PMEO treatment displayed synergismwith cisplatin in inducing the cytotoxic effect.

Dose-response treatments revealed that1-5 improved cell survival at nanomolar concentrations through the restoration ofmitochondrial membrane potential and the reduction of reactive oxygen species.Their ability to prevent the mitochondrial permeability transition pore openingwas also assessed, finding that 4 and 5 inhibited the channel at 0.001 μM. Thisinhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of cyclophilin D, themain regulator of the pore, which was also reduced by 1 and 2. However, theactivation of ERK and GSK3β, upstream modulators of the channel, was not affectedby compounds. Therefore, their ability to bind cyclophilin D was evaluated bysurface plasmon resonance, observing that 2-5 presented equilibrium dissociationconstants in the micromolar range. All compounds also showed affinity forcyclophilin A, being 1 selective toward this isoform, while 2 and 5 exhibitedselectivity for cyclophilin D. When the effects on the intracellular expressionof cyclophilins A-C were determined, it was found that only 1 decreasedcyclophilin A, while cyclophilins B and C were diminished by most compounds,displaying enhanced effects under oxidative stress conditions.

A significant increase in ROS level was alsodetected in the cells following exposure to the EO. This compound showed strongDPPH radical scavenging activity (IC(50): 30). It was also effective againstGram-positive E. faecalis (ATCC 29,212) and Gram-negative E. coli (ATCC 11,333)bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that the EO of N.mahanesis could be considered a bioactive product with biomedical applicationsthat can be used as an alternative cancer treatment and applied in the biomedicalindustries.","Amirzadeh, Mahla, Soltanian, Sara, Mohamadi, Neda",2022,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2
TA042801,10.2147/IJN.S379736,Study on Integrated Pharmacokinetics of the Component-Based Chinese Medicine ofGinkgo biloba Leaves Based on Nanocrystalline Solid Dispersion Technology.,"BACKGROUND: To improve the dissolution and bioavailability of the component-basedChinese medicine of Ginkgo biloba leaves (GBCCM), a novel nanocrystalline soliddispersion of GBCCM (GBCCM NC-SD) was first prepared. METHODS: GBCCM mainlycontaining high pure flavonoid aglycones (FAs) and terpenoid lactones (TLs) wasused as the model drug. PVP K30 and SDS were used as solubilizers, combinedstabilizers and carriers, and GBCCM NC-SD was prepared by high-pressurehomogenization combined with freeze-dryer. Morphology and crystal characteristicof GBCCM NC-SD were analyzed. The dissolution and bioavailability evaluation wereperformed to investigate the feasibility of GBCCM NC-SD by in vitro dissolutionand in vivo integrated pharmacokinetic models. RESULTS: After homogenizing for 30cycles under the pressure of 650 bar and freeze-drying, GBCCM NC-SD with uniformquality would be obtained. The particle size, PDI and zeta potential were foundto be 335.9 ± 32.8 nm, 0.29 ± 0.02 and -28.4 ± 0.7 mV respectively. Based oncharged aerosol detector (CAD) technology, a new chromatographic method forsimultaneous detection of eight components in GBCCM was developed. In vitro drugrelease study showed that the cumulative dissolution of FAs and TLs in GBCCMNC-SD increased from 12.77% to 52.92% (P < 0.01) and 90.91% to 99.21% (P < 0.05)respectively. In comparison with physical mixture of GBCCM and stabilizer (PM),the integrated pharmacokinetics AUC(0-t) of FAs and TLs in GBCCM NC-SD weresignificantly increased (P < 0.05), and the T(1/2) of TLs was also significantlyprolonged (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that novel GBCCM NC-SDwas prepared using Polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP K30) and Sodium dodecyl sulfate(SDS) as a synergetic stabilizer and also provided a feasible way to improve thedissolution and oral bioavailability of poorly soluble candidate antihypertensivedrugs.","Liang, Hongbao, Sun, Chenghong, Feng, Zhong, Wang, Xianzhen, Kong, Lingpeng, Zhu, Feng, Yao, Jingchun, Yuan, Xiaomei, Liu, Zhong, Zhang, Guimin, Li, Feng",2022,International journal of nanomedicine,2
TA042803,10.3390/molecules27144581,Potential Efficacy of β-Amyrin Targeting Mycobacterial Universal Stress Proteinby In Vitro and In Silico Approach.,"The emergence of drug resistance and the limited number of approvedantitubercular drugs prompted identification and development of newantitubercular compounds to cure Tuberculosis (TB). In this work, an attempt wasmade to identify potential natural compounds that target mycobacterial proteins.Three plant extracts (A. aspera, C. gigantea and C. procera) were investigated.The ethyl acetate fraction of the aerial part of A. aspera and the flower ash ofC. gigantea were found to be effective against M. tuberculosis H(37)Rv.Furthermore, the GC-MS analysis of the plant fractions confirmed the presence ofactive compounds in the extracts. The Mycobacterium target proteins, i.e.,available PDB dataset proteins and proteins classified in virulence,detoxification, and adaptation, were investigated. A total of ten target proteinswere shortlisted for further study, identified as follows: BpoC, RipA, MazF4,RipD, TB15.3, VapC15, VapC20, VapC21, TB31.7, and MazF9. Molecular dockingstudies showed that β-amyrin interacted with most of these proteins and itshighest binding affinity was observed with Mycobacterium Rv1636 (TB15.3) protein.The stability of the protein-ligand complex was assessed by molecular dynamicsimulation, which confirmed that β-amyrin most firmly interacted with Rv1636protein. Rv1636 is a universal stress protein, which regulates Mycobacteriumgrowth in different stress conditions and, thus, targeting Rv1636 makes M.tuberculosis vulnerable to host-derived stress conditions.","Beg, Md Amjad, Shivangi, Afzal, Obaid, Akhtar, Md Sayeed, Altamimi, Abdulmalik S A, Hussain, Afzal, Imam, Md Ali, Ahmad, Mohammad Naiyaz, Chopra, Sidharth, Athar, Fareeda",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

Toexplore the potential value of wild roses distributed in the Sichuan-Tibetregion, solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-massspectrometry (GC-MS) were used to determine the volatile organic compounds (VOCs)in Rosa willmottiae flowers at three flowering stages (bud stage, initialflowering stage, full flowering stage). Meanwhile, we compared the VOCs of R.willmottiae with different phenotypes (double flowers and single flowers). Atotal of 74 volatile compounds were identified. The results show that theessential substances belong to alcohols and terpenoids. The main volatile organiccompounds are 2-phenyl ethanol (20.49%), benzyl alcohol (10.69%), β-maaliene(8.66%), geranyl acetate (8.47%), and (+)-α-long pinene (6.127%). Differentflowering stages had great influence on the volatile profile, from the bud stageto full flowering stage; the content of terpenoids released decreased by 6.17%,whereas alcohols and esters increased by 8.58% and 11.56%, respectively. Thechemical diversity and the content of the main components with a differentphenotype were not significantly different.

TA042871,10.1155/2022/7441296,Cloning and Characterization of the Gene Encoding HMGS Synthase in Polygonatumsibiricum.,"The saponins of Polygonatum sibiricum had many pharmacological activities such asantitumor, antioxidation, and blood sugar lowering, which were synthesized by twopathways: mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP).3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (HMGS) was the key enzyme in theMVA synthesis pathway, and its expression level may affect the accumulation ofsaponins which were the main active ingredients of P. sibiricum. In this study,we successfully cloned HMGS1 and HMGS2 from P. sibiricum and their sequencesimilarity was 93.71% with 89 different sites. The multiple sequence alignmentresults indicated that the N-terminal sequences of HMGS were conserved.Phylogenetic analysis showed that P. sibiricum, A. officinalis, N. tazetta, D.nobile, and other relatives had a common evolutionary ancestor. The expressionlevels of both HMGSs and the total saponin content in different tissues revealedthat HMGS expression in rhizomes was positively correlated with total saponincontent. Further study of the abiotic stress effect of Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA)demonstrated that the expression of HMGS1 and HMGS2 genes was induced by MeJA,peaked at 24 h, and fell by 48 h. Our present findings would provide a blueprintfor future studies of HMGS and its role in triterpenoid biosynthesis in P.sibiricum.","Jiang, Yujie, Wang, Dekai, Wu, Kangjing, Wang, Feifeng, Yang, Qingwen, Han, Ruilian, Liang, Zongsuo, Jia, Qiaojun",2022,BioMed research international,2

TA042962,10.1002/vms3.977,Induction of apoptosis by essential oil of Dracocephalum kotschyi on Trichomonasvaginalis.,"BACKGROUND: Trichomonas vaginalis is a protist parasite that causestrichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease. Metronidazole is the currenttreatment for trichomoniasis. However, this drug can provoke severe side effects,and some strains present resistance, making the development of alternativetreatments for trichomoniasis urgent. OBJECTIVES: We investigate the use ofessential oil obtained from Dracocephalum kotschyi on T. vaginalis. D. kotschyihas antispasmodic and analgesic properties and is well known in Iran. METHODS:The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation from 1000 g of the powderedplant. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used for the chemicalcomposition of the essential oil, and 11 substances were identified,corresponding to 91.5% of the oil. Copaene (22.15%), Methyl geranate (16.31%),Geranial (13.78%) and Carvone (11.34%) were the main substances. A cell viabilitytest was used to determine the percentage of growth inhibition (GI%) and thehalf-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) on T. vaginalis after incubationwith the prepared essential oil. RESULTS: The oil induced an IC50 of 84.07 µg/mlafter 24 h contact with trophozoites. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay onthe J774.A1 haematopoietic cell line. In addition, the initial stage of apoptosiswas assayed using the fluorescein isothiocyanate Annexin V Apoptosis DetectionKit. Evaluation of the in vitro anti-trichomonal properties of D. kotschyiessential oils showed that it effectively induces apoptosis on T. vaginalisbetween 100 and 700 µg/ml after 48 h without toxicity on haematopoietic cells,suggesting that D. kotschyi essential oil can induce programmed death in T.vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-trichomonal properties of D. kotschyi essentialoil indicate that they could be suitable for new pharmacologic studies after newtests with human vaginal epithelial cells.","Chelgerdi Dehkordi, Bahareh, Esmaeilifallah, Mahsa, Kalantari, Reza, Benchimol, Marlene, Khamesipour, Faham",2023,Veterinary medicine and science,2

The maize silk contains bioactivecomponents explored by traditional Chinese herbal medicine for variouspharmacological activities. However, Fusarium graminearum, Fusariumverticillioides, Trichoderma atroviride, and Ustilago maydis can infect themaize, produce mycotoxins, hamper the quantity and quality of silk production,and further harm the primary consumer's health. However, the defense mechanism isnot fully understood in multiple fungal infections in the silk of Z. mays. Inthis study, we applied bioinformatics approaches to use the publicly availabletranscriptome data of Z. mays silk affected by multiple fungal flora to identifycore genes involved in combatting disease response. Differentially expressedgenes (DEGs) were identified among intra- and inter-transcriptome data sets ofcontrol versus infected Z. mays silks. Upon further comparison between up- anddownregulated genes within the control of datasets, 4,519 upregulated and 5,125downregulated genes were found. The DEGs have been compared with genes in themodules of weighted gene co-expression network analysis to relevant specifictraits towards identifying core genes. The expression pattern of transcriptionfactors, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme), and resistance genes was analyzed.The present investigation is supportive of our findings that the gene ontology,immunity stimulus, and resistance genes are upregulated, but physical andmetabolic processes such as cell wall organizations and pectin synthesis weredownregulated respectively.

They are widely distributed in nature and possess a variety ofbiological activities. Up to date, only five fusicoccane-type diterpene synthaseshave been identified. Here, we identify a two-gene biosynthetic gene clustercontaining a new fusicoccane-type diterpene synthase gene tadA and an associatedcytochrome P450 gene tadB from Talaromyces wortmannii ATCC 26942. Heterologousexpression reveals that TadA catalyzes the formation of a new fusicoccane-typediterpene talaro-7,13-diene. D(2)O isotope labeling combined with site-directedmutagenesis indicates that TadA might employ a different C2,6 cyclizationstrategy from the known fusicoccane-type diterpene synthases, in which a neutralintermediate is firstly formed and then protonated by an environmental proton.

The natural product Ilex kudingcha C. J Tseng enrichedwith ursolic acid has anti-cancer activity and could potentially augment thetherapeutic effects of BCI. The objective of the present study was to determinepotential additive effects of these modalities. METHODS: We investigated theanti-cancer activity of KDCE (Kudingcha extract) combined with S.t△ppGpp in themice colon cancer models. RESULTS: In the present study, KDCE combined withS.t△ppGpp BCI improved antitumor therapeutic efficacy compared to S.t△ppGpp orKDCE alone. KDCE did not prolong bacterial tumor-colonizing time, but enhancedthe antiangiogenic effect of S.t△ppGpp by downregulatingVEGFR2. We speculatedthat KDCE-induced VEGFR2 downregulation is associated with FAK/MMP9/STAT3 axisbut not AKT or ERK. CONCLUSIONS: Ursolic acid-enriched KDCE enhances theantitumor activity of BCI, which could be mediated by VEGFR2 downregulation andsubsequent suppression of angiogenesis. Therefore, combination therapy withS.t△ppGpp and KDCE is a potential cancer therapeutic strategy.","Xu, Haixia, Piao, Linghua, Liu, Xiande, Jiang, Sheng-Nan",2022,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2
TA043267,10.3390/molecules27217573,Comparative Metabolomic Profiling of the Metabolic Differences ofΔ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabidiol.,"More than one hundred cannabinoids have been found in cannabis.Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the recognized addictive constituent incannabis; however, the mechanisms underlying THC-induced toxicity remain elusive.To better understand cannabis-induced toxicity, the present study compared themetabolic pathways of THC and its isomer cannabidiol (CBD) in human and mouseliver microsomes using the metabolomic approach. Thirty-two metabolites of THCwere identified, including nine undescribed metabolites. Of note, two glutathione(GSH) and two cysteine (Cys) adducts were found in THC's metabolism. Moleculardocking revealed that THC conjugates have a higher affinity with GSH and Cys thanwith the parent compound, THC. Human recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes, andtheir corresponding chemical inhibitors, demonstrated that CYP3A4 and CYP1B1 werethe primary enzymes responsible for the formation of THC-GSH and THC-Cys, thusenabling conjugation to occur. Collectively, this study systematically comparedthe metabolism of THC with the metabolism of CBD using the metabolomic approach,which thus highlights the critical role of metabolomics in identifying novel drugmetabolites. Moreover, this study also facilitates mechanistic speculation inorder to expand the knowledge of drug metabolism and safety.","Rao, Qianru, Zhang, Ting, Dai, Manyun, Li, Bin, Pu, Qianlun, Zhao, Min, Cheng, Yan, Yan, Dongmei, Zhao, Qi, Wu, Zhanxuan E, Li, Fei",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA043299,10.1002/iid3.667,Antiviral activity of triptolide on herpes simplex virus in vitro.,"BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus-type 1 (HSV-1) can cause diseases, especiallyamongst neonates and immunocompromised hosts. Hence, developing a novelanti-HSV-1 drug with low-level toxicity is vital. Triptolide (TP), a diterpenoidtriepoxide is a natural product with range of bioactivity qualities. METHODS: Inthis study, viral infection was assessed in different phases of the HSV-1replication cycle on A549 cells, using various assays, such as adsorptioninhibition assay, penetration inhibition assay, time-of-addition assay, andquantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: The results indicate thatTP can effectively inhibit HSV-1 infection in the lowest range of concentration.TP exhibited significant inhibitory effect on HSV-1 plaque formation, with 50%effective concentration (EC50) of 0.05 µM. Furthermore, the time-of-additionassay suggests that TP has viral inhibitory effects when it was added less than8 h postinfection (h.p.i.). This result is further confirmed by decline in theexpression viral immediate-early genes (ICP4, ICP22, and ICP27) in 6 h.p.i in theTP-treated group compared to the control group, evaluated by real-time qPCR. TheWestern blotting result was also consistent with the previous findings, whichconfirms that TP can positively affect ICP4 during HSV-1 infection. CONCLUSIONS:The TP also showed antiviral activity against HSV-1. This dose-dependent activityis an indication of a particular cellular component, rather than cytotoxicitythat has mediated its function. Finally, the result suggest a new approach for aneffective treatment option of the HSV-1 infections.","Aliabadi, Nasrin, Jamalidoust, Marzieh, Pouladfar, Gholamreza, Ziyaeyan, Atoosa, Ziyaeyan, Mazyar",2022,"Immunity, inflammation and disease",2

Anisomelic acid effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication andviral-induced cytopathic effects with an EC(50) of 1.1 and 4.3 μM, respectively.Challenge studies of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice showed that oraladministration of anisomelic acid and subcutaneous dosing of remdesivir can bothreduce the viral titers in the lung tissue at the same level. To facilitate drugdiscovery, we used a semisynthetic approach to shorten the project timelines. Theenantioselective semisynthesis of anisomelic acid from the naturally enriched andcommercially available starting material (+)-costunolide was achieved in fivesteps with a 27% overall yield. The developed chemistry provides opportunitiesfor developing anisomelic-acid-based novel ligands for selectively targetingproteins involved in viral infections.","Yu, Hai-Xin, Zheng, Nan, Yeh, Chi-Tai, Lee, Chien-Ming, Zhang, Qi, Zheng, Wen-Lv, Chang, Qing, Li, Yuan-He, Li, Yu-Jun, Wu, Gui-Zhen, Quan, Jun-Min, Zhang, Lin-Qi, Tzeng, Yew-Min, Yang, Zhen",2022,National science review,2
TA043317,10.3390/antiox11091723,Bridging the Chemical Profile and Biomedical Effects of Scutellaria edelbergiiEssential Oils.,"The present study explored chemical constituents of Scutellaria edelbergiiessential oils (SEEO) for the first time, extracted through hydro-distillation,and screened them against the microbes and free radicals scavenging effect,pain-relieving, and anti-inflammatory potential employing standard techniques.The SEEO ingredients were noticed via Gas Chromatography-Mass-Spectrometry(GC-MS) analysis and presented fifty-two bioactive compounds contributed (89.52%)with dominant volatile constituent; 3-oxomanoyl oxide (10.09%),24-norursa-3,12-diene (8.05%), and methyl 7-abieten-18-oate (7.02%). The MTTassay via 96 well-plate and agar-well diffusion techniques against variousmicrobes was determined for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimumbactericidal concentration (MBC), IC(50), and zone of inhibitions (ZOIs). TheSEEO indicated considerable antimicrobial significance against tested bacterialstrains viz. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, andEnterococcus faecalis and the fungal strains Fusarium oxysporum and Candidaalbicans. The free radicals scavenging potential was noticed to be significant in1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) as compared to2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzotiazolin-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assays with IC(50) =125.0 ± 0.19 µg/mL and IC(50) = 153.0 ± 0.31 µg/mL correspondingly; similarly,the antioxidant standard in the DPPH assay was found efficient as compared toABTS assay. The SEEO also offered an appreciable analgesic significance andpresented 54.71% in comparison with standard aspirin, 64.49% reduction inwrithes, and an anti-inflammatory potential of 64.13%, as compared to thestandard diclofenac sodium inhibition of 71.72%. The SEEO contain bioactivevolatile ingredients with antimicrobial, free radical scavenging, pain, andinflammation relieving potentials. Computational analysis validated theanti-inflammatory potential of selected hit ""methyl 7-abieten-18-oate"" as a COX-2enzyme inhibitor. Docking results were very good in terms of docked score(-7.8704 kcal/mol) and binding interactions with the functional residues;furthermore, MD simulation for 100 ns has presented a correlation with dockingresults with minor fluctuations.

TA043323,10.31557/APJCP.2022.23.2.583,Effect of Betulinic acid Extraction from Guava (Psidium guajava Linn.) LeavesAgainst Human Cholangiocarcinoma Cells.,"BACKGROUND: Betulinic acid (BA), a pentacyclic triterpene glycoside extract fromguava (Psidium guajava Linn.) leaves, displays a variety of biological activitieswhich exhibit cancer therapeutic properties associated with cancer growthinhibition in various kinds of human cancer cells including brain, breast,colorectal, cervical, lung and prostate gland. However, the effects on humancholangiocarcinoma cells have not previously been reported. Current study, weevaluated the activity of BA against human cholangiocarcinoma (HuCCA) cells.METHODS: The cytotoxicity analysis was measured by using MTT assay on HuCCA andBHK-21 cells. Analysis of apoptosis was evaluated by using staining with Hoechst33342 and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: The BA (50-800 µg/mL)significantly reduced the viability of HuCCA cells in a dose-dependent actionwith 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 92.45 µg/mL at 24 h. It also inducedapoptosis signaling pathway, such as nuclear chromatin condensation andfragmentation. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that BA increasedp53, Bax and caspase-3 expression whilst it decreased Bcl-2 expression in theHuCCA cells in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: BA can inhibit the HuCCA cellviability and induce apoptosis of neoplastic cells. This study indicates that BAhas effective treatment for cholangiocarcinoma in vitro. Consequently, BA may beused as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma in thefuture.","Phonarknguen, Rassameepen, Nobsathian, Saksit, Assawasuparerk, Kanjana",2022,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2
TA043326,10.1038/s41467-022-30095-z,Triplet-driven chemical reactivity of β-carotene and its biological implications.,"The endoperoxides of β-carotene (βCar-EPOs) are regarded as main products of thechemical deactivation of (1)O(2) by β-carotene, one of the most importantantioxidants, following a concerted singlet-singlet reaction. Here we challengethis view by showing that βCar-EPOs are formed in the absence of (1)O(2) in anon-concerted triplet-triplet reaction: (3)O(2) + (3)β-carotene → βCar-EPOs, inwhich (3)β-carotene manifests a strong biradical character. Thus, the reactivityof β-carotene towards oxygen is governed by its excited triplet state. βCar-EPOs,while being stable in the dark, are photochemically labile, and are a rareexample of nonaromatic endoperoxides that release (1)O(2), again not in aconcerted reaction. Their light-induced breakdown triggers an avalanche of freeradicals, which accounts for the pro-oxidant activity of β-carotene and thepuzzling swap from its anti- to pro-oxidant features. Furthermore, we show thatβCar-EPOs, and carotenoids in general, weakly sensitize (1)O(2). These findingsunderlie the key role of the triplet state in determining the chemical andphotophysical features of β-carotene. They shake up the prevailing models ofcarotenoid photophysics, the anti-oxidant functioning of β-carotene, and the roleof (1)O(2) in chemical signaling in biological photosynthetic systems. βCar-EPOsand their degradation products are not markers of (1)O(2) and oxidative stressbut of the overproduction of extremely hazardous chlorophyll triplets inphotosystems. Hence, the chemical signaling of overexcitation of thephotosynthetic apparatus is based on a (3)chlorophyll-(3)β-carotene relay, ratherthan on extremely short-lived (1)O(2).","Zbyradowski, Mateusz, Duda, Mariusz, Wisniewska-Becker, Anna, Heriyanto, Rajwa, Weronika, Fiedor, Joanna, Cvetkovic, Dragan, Pilch, Mariusz, Fiedor, Leszek",2022,Nature communications,2

This switchdepends on actin and apoplastic respiratory burst. Plant cell fermentation, theproduction of valuable products in plant cell culture, has great potential assustainable alternative to the exploitation of natural resources for compounds ofpharmaceutical interest. However, the success of this approach has remainedlimited, because the cellular aspects of metabolic competence are mostly unknown.The production of the anti-cancer alkaloid Paclitaxel has been, so far, the mostsuccessful case for this approach. In the current work, we map cellular aspectsof alkaloid synthesis in cells of Taxus chinensis using a combination oflive-cell imaging, quantitative physiology, and metabolite analysis. We showevidence that metabolic potency correlates with a differentiation event givingrise to cells with large vacuoles with a tonoplast that is of a glossyappearance, agglomerations of lipophilic compounds, and multivesicular bodiesthat fuse with the plasma membrane. Cellular features of these glossy cells arebundled actin, more numerous peroxisomes, and vermiform mitochondria. Theincidence of glossy cells can be increased by aluminium ions, and this increaseis significantly reduced by the actin inhibitor Latrunculin B, and by diphenyleneiodonium, a specific inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase Respiratory burst oxidaseHomologue (RboH). It is also reduced by the artificial auxin Picloram. Thiscellular fingerprint matches the implications of a model, where thedifferentiation into the glossy cell type is regulated by the actin-auxinoscillator that in plant cells acts as dynamic switch between growth and defence.","Manz, Christina, Raorane, Manish L, Maisch, Jan, Nick, Peter",2022,Plant cell reports,2

Therefore, inhibition of MDSC accumulation and function is criticalfor further enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibody in amajority of cancer patients. Artemisinin (ART), the most effective antimalarialdrug with tumoricidal and immunoregulatory activities, is a potential option forcancer treatment. Although ART is reported to reduce MDSC levels in 4T1 breasttumor model and improve the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibody in T celllymphoma-bearing mice, how ART influences MDSC accumulation, function, andmolecular pathways as well as MDSC-mediated anti-PD-L1 resistance in melanoma orliver tumors remains unknown. Here, we reported that ART blocks the accumulationand function of MDSCs by polarizing M2-like tumor-promoting phenotype towardsM1-like antitumor one. This switch is regulated via PI3K/AKT, mTOR, and MAPKsignaling pathways. Targeting MDSCs by ART could significantly reduce tumorgrowth in various mouse models. More importantly, the ART therapy remarkablyenhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in tumor-bearing mice throughpromoting antitumor T cell infiltration and proliferation. These findingsindicate that ART controls the functional polarization of MDSCs and targetingMDSCs by ART provides a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance anti-PD-L1 cancerimmunotherapy.","Zhang, Mengqi, Wang, Lulu, Liu, Wan, Wang, Tian, De Sanctis, Francesco, Zhu, Lifang, Zhang, Guizhong, Cheng, Jian, Cao, Qin, Zhou, Jingying, Tagliabue, Aldo, Bronte, Vincenzo, Yan, Dehong, Wan, Xianchun, Yu, Guang",2022,Journal of immunology research,2
TA043372,10.1007/s10787-022-01038-3,Ursolic acid and SARS-CoV-2 infection: a new horizon and perspective.,"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2) has beenidentified as the source of a world coronavirus pandemic in 2019. Covid-19 isconsidered a main respiratory disease-causing viral pneumonia and, in severecases, leads to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS). Although, extrapulmonary manifestations of Covid-19 like neurological,cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal have been confirmed. Exaggerated immuneresponse and release of a high amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines may progress,causing a cytokine storm. Consequently, direct and indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2infection can evolve into systemic complications due to the progression of hyperinflammation, oxidative stress and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system(RAS). Therefore, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents could be efficient inalleviating these disorders. Ursolic acid has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, andantiviral effects; it reduces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, improvesanti-inflammatory cytokines, and inhibits the production of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS). In virtue of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects,ursolic acid may minimize SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced complications. Also, byregulating RAS and inflammatory signaling pathways, ursolic acid mighteffectively reduce the development of ALI in ARDS in Covid-19. In this state,this perspective discusses how ursolic acid can mitigate hyper inflammation andoxidative stress in Covid-19.","Al-Kuraishy, Hayder M, Al-Gareeb, Ali I, Negm, Walaa A, Alexiou, Athanasios, Batiha, Gaber El-Saber",2022,Inflammopharmacology,2

Mediterranean medicinal and aromatic herbscontain a wide range of bioactives (non-volatile polyphenols, volatile terpenes)that are important constituents of herbal extracts and essential oils. Theantioxidant capacity and potential health benefits of these bioactives could beassociated with their synergistic effects. Therefore, this study aimed tocharacterize the non-volatile and volatile bioactives of sage (Salvia officinalisL.), wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum L.) and laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) aqueousextracts and their two- and three-component mixtures as well as their antioxidantcapacity. The content of total phenols, flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic acids andflavonols was determined spectrophotometrically. Individual polyphenols wereanalyzed by LC-MS/MS, the volatiles were analyzed by HS-SPME/GC-MS, and theantioxidant capacity was analyzed by ORAC and DPPH assays. The results showedthat aqueous extracts of all examined herbs and their mixtures contained a highcontent of phenolic compounds ranging from 0.97 to 2.79 g L(-1) of the sample,among which the most common were flavonols. At the same time, mono- andsesquiterpenes were the main volatiles.

Inthis study, a library of the known and novel Glycyrrhizic acid (GL) derivativesbearing amino acid residues or their methyl/ethyl esters in the carbohydrate partwere synthesized and studied as DENV inhibitors in vitro using the cytopathiceffect (CPE), viral infectivity and virus yield assays with DENV1 and DENV-2 inVero E6 and A549 cells. Among the GL conjugates tested, compound hits GL-D-ValOMe3, GL-TyrOMe 6, GL-PheOEt 11, and GL-LysOMe 21 were discovered to have betterantiviral activity than GL, with IC50 values ranging from <0.1 to 5.98 μM on thein vitro infectivity of DENV1 and DENV2 in Vero E6 and A549 cells. Compound hits3, 6, 11, and 21 had a concentration-dependent inhibition on the virus yield inVero E6, in which GL-D-ValOMe 3 and GL-PheOEt 11 were the most active inhibitorsof DENV2 yield. Meanwhile, the time-of-addition assay indicated that conjugatesGL-D-ValOMe 3 and GL-PheOEt 11 exhibited a substantial decrease in the DENV2attachment stage. Subsequently, chimeric single-round infectious particles(SRIPs) of DENV2 C-prM-E protein/JEV replicon and DENV2 prM-E/ZIKV replicon wereutilized for the DENV envelope I protein-mediated attachment assay. GL conjugates3 and 11 significantly reduced the attachment of chimeric DENV2 C-prM-E/JEV andDENV2 prM-E/ZIKV SRIPs onto Vero E6 cells in a concentration-dependent manner butdid not impede the attachment of wild-type JEV CprME/JEV and ZIKV prM-E/ZIKVSRIPs, indicating the inhibition of Compounds 3 and 11 on DENV2 E-mediatedattachment. Molecular docking data revealed that Compounds 3 and 11 havehydrophobic interactions within a hydrophobic pocket among the interfaces ofDomains I, II, and the stem region of the DENV2 envelope (E) protein. Theseresults displayed that Compounds 3 and 11 were the lead compounds targeting theDENV E protein.

The astragaloside IV andflavonoid contents increased with decreasing diameter size. Bark-tissue hadsignificantly higher astragaloside IV and formononetin content than that in thewood-tissue. As a higher proportion of bark-tissue is associated with decreasingdiameter, a strong correlation was also shown between bark- to wood-tissue ratioand active ingredients' content. Furthermore, an increase in astragaloside IVcontent was observed in thin powder as compared to coarse powder ground from thewhole root. However, this association between active ingredients' content andpowder particle size was abolished when isolating bark- and wood-tissueindividually. Moreover, AR stir-frying with refined honey, a typical processingmethod of AR, increased formononetin content. The turnover rate of activeconstituents upon decoction ranged from 61.9-81.4%.

CYP19A1 (cytochrome P450 family19A1; also known as aromatase, Ar) was correlated to GCa prognosis. Relatedly, Arsilencers, which halt the expression of Ar exhibited anti-GCa effects inexperimental models, are currently being investigated. METHOD: The dockingsimulation score of UA was compared with Ar inhibitors, e.g., letrozole,exemestane, in Ar protein crystallization. Hedyotis diffusa Willd ethanolextract, UA, or 5-fluracil were applied onto AGS, SC-M1, MKN45 GCa cells forcancer inhibition tests. Immunoblot for measuring gene expressions upon drugtreatments, or gene knockdown/overexpression. Treatments were also applied in aMKN45 implantation tumor model. A web-based GCa cohort for Ar expressionassociation with prognosis was performed. RESULT: The ethanol extracts ofHedyotis diffusa Willd, enrich with UA, exhibited cytotoxic activity against GCacells. Molecular docking simulations with the 3D Ar structure revealed anexcellent fitting score for UA. UA increase cytotoxic, and suppressed colony, inaddition to its Ar silencing capacity. Moreover, UA synergistically facilitated5-FU, (a standard GCa treatment) regimen in vitro. Consistent with those results,adding estradiol did not reverse the cancer-suppressing effects of UA, whichconfirmed UA acts as an Ar silencer. Furthermore, UA exhibited tumor-suppressingindex (TSI) score of 90% over a 6-week treatment term when used for single dosingin xenograft tumor model. In the clinical setting, Ar expression was found to behigher in GCa tumors than normal parental tissue from the TCGA (The Cancer GenomeAtlas) cohort, while high Ar expression associated with poor prognosis. Together,the results indicate UA could be used to treat GCa by silencing Ar expression inGCa.

Therefore, we urgently need to develop effective drugs to solvethis problem. As a semisynthetic derivative of artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin(DHA) has been proved to have antitumor activity in glioma, which can induceapoptosis and inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells.In recent years, ferroptosis has been identified as another antitumor mechanismof DHA. Researchers have shown that DHA could promote ferroptosis in gliomacells. However, the specific molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis induced by DHAneed more exploration. In this study, we found DHA could induce ferroptosis withROS production and lipid peroxidation in glioma cells. Low expression of GPX4 andhigh expression of HMOX1 were identified in DHA treated glioma cells.Surprisingly, we found FTH1, a negative regulator of ferroptosis, upregulated inDHA treated glioma cells. It indicated that there should be some mechanisms thatmay cause ferroptosis attenuation in DHA treated glioma cells. For the firsttime, we confirmed that MYC-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) could activelyregulate FTH1 by binding to FTH1 promoter by CHIP assay. MAZ was furtheridentified as the direct target of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) TUG1 throughluciferase assay. Downregulated expression of TUG1 and upregulated expression ofMAZ were identified in DHA treated glioma cells. TUG1 overexpression orinhibition of FTH1 expression could enhance the antiglioma effect of DHA in vitroand in vivo, providing a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effect ofDHA in glioma.","Gong, Hailong, Gao, Mingjun, Lin, Yuancai, Liu, Jinliang, Hu, Zhiwen, Liu, Jing",2022,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2

(IHEO) was reinforced incomplexation of whey protein nanofibrils and mung bean protein nanoparticles(WPNF-MBP NPs) as a novel nano-carrier. A desirable retention rate range of50.9-90.4% was confirmed for IHEO reinforced in WPNF-MBP NPs. Fourier transforminfrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that IHEO was successfully loaded withinWPNF-MBP NPs without specific chemical interaction with the carrier matrix. Theresults indicated that incorporation of IHEO-reinforced WPNF-MBP NPs into activematerial coatings having acceptable inhibition activity against total viable andpsychrotrophic bacteria. The coated fishes also retarded the increase of PV(peroxide value), TBA (thiobarbituric acid) and TVB-N (total volatile basicnitrogen) values during storage. The IHEO-reinforced WPNF-MBP NPs coating led toan extension in the shelf life of Rainbow trout fillets within 8-14 days ofstorage. Accordingly, IHEO-reinforced WPNF-MBP NPs can be suggested as a naturalpreservative for coating fishes.","Majidiyan, Nava, Hadidi, Milad, Azadikhah, Dariush, Moreno, Andres",2022,Food chemistry: X,2

Nepeta species arecommonly employed in traditional medicine for a variety of ailments, as well asfood additives. In addition, they also come to the fore with their richphytochemical content. In the present study, the quantitative phytochemicalcontent of methanolic extracts and infusions prepared from the aerial parts of 14Nepeta taxa collected from Turkey and their cytotoxic effects on two breastcancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were investigated by using the MTT(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl))-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide) test. Accordingto HPLC-PDA analysis, N. racemosa methanolic extract had the highest ursolic acidcontent with 165.9 mg/g extract. Total sterol, total iridoid, and totaltriterpenoid content were determined to be greatest in the methanolic extracts ofN. meyeri, N. trichocalyx and N. phyllochlamys. The MTT experiment demonstratedthat certain Nepeta species suppressed the growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cellsin a dose-dependent manner. Statistical analysis revealed a strong correlationbetween the cytotoxic effects of the extracts and their triterpene content.

Leaf Extract.,"Steroid 5α-reductase plays a crucial role in catalyzing the conversion oftestosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which is involved in many androgen-dependentdisorders. Leaf-hexane extract from Tectona grandis L.f. has shown promise as a5α-reductase inhibitor. The objectives of this current study were to isolate andidentify 5α-reductase inhibitors from T. grandis leaves and to use them as thebioactive markers for standardization of the extract. Three terpenoid compounds,(+)-eperua-8,13-dien-15-oic acid (1), (+)-eperua-7,13-dien-15-oic acid (2), andlupeol (3), were isolated and evaluated for 5α-reductase inhibitory activity.Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited potent 5α-reductase inhibitory activity, while 3showed weak inhibitory activity. An HPLC method for the quantitativedetermination of the two potent inhibitors (1 and 2), applicable for qualitycontrol of T. grandis leaf extracts, was also developed. The ethanolic extractshowed a significantly higher content of 1 and 2 than found in the hexaneextract, suggesting that ethanol is a preferable extraction solvent. This studyis the first reported isolation of 5α-reductase inhibitors (1 and 2) from T.grandis leaves. The extraction and quality control methods that are safe anduseful for further development of T. grandis leaf extract as an active ingredientfor hair loss treatment products are also reported.","Insumrong, Kamonlak, Ingkaninan, Kornkanok, Waranuch, Neti, Tanuphol, Nutchaninad, Wisuitiprot, Wudtichai, Promgool, Trinop, Suphrom, Nungruthai",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

In the search for agentswith antivirulence activity, essential oils could represent a strategy to actagainst biofilms and to potentiate antifungal drugs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate theantivirulence effect of Origanum vulgare L. essential oil (O-EO) against Candidaspp. and to potentiate the effect of fluconazole and nystatin. METHODS: Theeffect of O-EO was evaluated on ATCC reference strains of C. albicans andnon-albicans Candida species. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) wasdetermined through broth microdilution assay. Adhesion to microplates wasdetermined by crystal violet (CV) assay. An adapted scratch assay in 24-well wasused to determine the effect of essential oil on biofilms proliferation.Viability of biofilms was evaluated by MTT reduction assay and through acheckerboard assay we determined if O-EO could act synergistically withfluconazole and nystatin. RESULTS: MIC for C. albicans ATCC-90029 and ATCC-10231was 0.01 mg/L and 0.97 mg/L, respectively. For non-albicans Candida strains MICvalues were 2.6 mg/L for C. dubliniensis ATCC-CD36 and 5.3 mg/L for C. kruseiATCC-6258. By using these concentrations, O-EO inhibited morphogenesis, adhesion,and proliferation at least by 50% for the strains assayed. In formed biofilmsO-EO decreased viability in ATCC 90029 and ATCC 10231 strains (IC50 7.4 and2.8 mg/L respectively). Finally, we show that O-EO interacted synergisticallywith fluconazole and nystatin.

TA043914,10.1038/s41467-022-29908-y,Deletion and tandem duplications of biosynthetic genes drive the diversity oftriterpenoids in Aralia elata.,"Araliaceae species produce various classes of triterpene and triterpenoidsaponins, such as the oleanane-type triterpenoids in Aralia species anddammarane-type saponins in Panax, valued for their medicinal properties. The lackof genome sequences of Panax relatives has hindered mechanistic insight into thedivergence of triterpene saponins in Araliaceae. Here, we report achromosome-level genome of Aralia elata with a total length of 1.05 Gb. The lossof 12 exons in the dammarenediol synthase (DDS)-encoding gene in A. elata afterdivergence from Panax might have caused the lack of dammarane-type saponinproduction, and a complementation assay shows that overexpression of the PgDDSgene from Panax ginseng in callus of A. elata recovers the accumulation ofdammarane-type saponins. Tandem duplication events of triterpene biosyntheticgenes are common in the A. elata genome, especially for AeCYP72As, AeCSLMs, andAeUGT73s, which function as tailoring enzymes of oleanane-type saponins andaralosides. More than 13 aralosides are de novo synthesized in Saccharomycescerevisiae by overexpression of these genes in combination.

The GC-MS analysis of AREO revealed the presence of linalool(81.46%) as a major component. The successful encapsulation of EO into CsNe wasconfirmed through SEM, FTIR, and XRD analysis. The in-vitro release study showedthe controlled release of AREO. AREO-CsNe caused complete inhibition ofAspergillus flavus (AFLHPSi-1) growth and AFB(1) production at 0.8 and 0.6 μl/ml,respectively, which was far better than AREO (1.4 and 1.2 μl/ml, respectively).Impairment of ergosterol biosynthesis coupled with enhancement of cellularmaterials leakage confirmed plasma membrane as the possible antifungal target ofboth AREO and AREO-CsNe. Significant inhibition of methylglyoxal (AFB(1) inducer)synthesis in AFLHPSi-1 cells by AREO and AREO-CsNe confirmed their novelantiaflatoxigenic mode of action. In-silico molecular docking studies revealedeffective interaction of linalool with Ver-1 and Omt-A proteins, leading toinhibition of AFB(1) biosynthesis. Further, AREO-CsNe showed enhanced antioxidantactivity with IC(50) values 3.792 and 1.706 μl/ml against DPPH(•) and ABTS(•+)radicals, respectively. In addition, AREO-CsNe caused 100% protection of storedmillets (Setaria italica seeds) from AFB(1) contamination and lipid peroxidationover a period of 1 year without compromising its sensory properties and exhibitedhigh safety profile with LD(50) value 9538.742 μl/kg body weight.

In vivo, MI mice models were established by left anteriordescending ligation and were divided into the sham group, MI + Vehicle group, andMI + GSRd group. DMSO, DMSO, and GSRd 50 μL/day were intraperitoneally injected,respectively. After 28 days, echocardiography, Masson staining,immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and Western blot wereperformed. Mice peritoneal macrophages were extracted in vitro, and Western blotwas performed after GSRd and/or Akt inhibitor MK2206 intervention. RESULTS: GSRdsignificantly improved mouse myocardial function, attenuated cardiac fibrosis,and inhibited inflammation and apoptosis in myocardial tissues after myocardialinfarction. Meanwhile, GSRd increased non-classical Ly6C(low) Mos/Mps whilereduced of classical Ly6C(high) Mos/Mps at the same time in myocardial tissues.In addition, GSRd significantly reversed the activity of p-Akt and p-mTOR in theheart Mos/Mps after MI. In vitro studies showed that the activity of p-Akt andp-mTOR in peritoneal macrophages were significantly increased in a dose-dependentmanner after GSRd treatment. Furthermore, the AKT inhibitor MK2206 was found toblock the enhanced activity of p-Akt and p-mTOR induced by GSRd in peritonealmacrophages. CONCLUSION: GSRd can enhance the transformation of Ly6C(high)Mos/Mps to Ly6C(low) Mos/Mps in mice after MI by activating the Akt/mTORsignaling pathway, inhibiting cardiac dysfunction and promoting cardiac repair.","Zhao, Tingyao, Wang, Xinting, Liu, Qian, Yang, Tianshu, Qu, Huiyan, Zhou, Hua",2022,"Drug design, development and therapy",2

We previouslydemonstrated that H. pylori activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) andincreased expression of MMP-10 in gastric epithelial cells. MMPs degrade theextracellular matrix, enhancing tumor invasion and cancer progression. Thesignaling pathway of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonineprotein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is associated withMMP expression. ROS activates PIK3/AKT/mTOR signaling in cancer. Astaxanthin, axanthophyll carotenoid, shows antioxidant activity by reducing ROS levels ingastric epithelial cells infected with H. pylori. This study aimed to determinewhether astaxanthin inhibits MMP expression, cell invasion, and migration byreducing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial AGScells. H. pylori induced PIK3/AKT/mTOR and NF-κB activation, decreased IκBα, andinduced MMP (MMP-7 and -10) expression, the invasive phenotype, and migration inAGS cells. Astaxanthin suppressed these H. pylori-induced alterations in AGScells. Specific inhibitors of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR reversed the H.pylori-stimulated NF-κB activation and decreased IκBα levels in the cells.

Vatke (Rubiaceae) to Combat Co-Infection of Tuberculosis andHelminthiasis.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of global importance that affects millions ofpeople. Approximately a quarter of the world's population is currently infectedwith M. tuberculosis, and about 10% of those infected will develop into activedisease, particularly immune compromised individuals. Helminthiasis is of globalhealth importance, affecting over 2 billion people mostly in resource-poorcountries. Co-infection with tuberculosis (TB) and helminths (worms) is anemerging global public health concern with both affecting about one-third of theglobal population. Chronic infection with helminths can result in impaired immuneresponses to TB as well as enhancing failure to TB therapy and BCG vaccination.Antimycobacterial and anthelmintic activities of the acetone extract andfractions of Psychotria capensis were evaluated, including their in vitro safety.In addition, the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect of the fractionsand crude extract of P. capensis were assessed. Antimycobacterial activity of theextract and fractions was tested against four non-tuberculous mycobacteria(Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. fortuitum, M. aurum, M. bovis BCG) and pathogenic M.tuberculosis H37Rv while the Egg Hatch Assay (EHA) was used for the anthelmintictest on eggs of Haemonchus contortus. Cytotoxicity was determined against Verokidney cells while in vitro immune modulation via cytokine production wasdetermined on activated macrophages. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)values of the Psychotria capensis acetone extract and fractions ranged from 39 to1,250 μg/ml with the crude extract and hexane fraction having the best MIC values(both 39 μg/ml). In the EHA, the inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) ranged from160 to 630 μg/ml with the hexane fraction having the best activity. The hexaneand chloroform fractions were relatively non-toxic with LC(50) values of 290 and248 μg/ml respectively, while the acetone crude extract (64 μg/ml) and n-butanolfraction (71 μg/ml) were moderately toxic. The SI values (LC(50)/MIC) ranged from0.1 to 7.4 with the hexane fraction having the highest value against M. smegmatis(7.4). The hexane fraction had the best dual anthelmintic and antimycobacterialactivity. This fraction had the best NO inhibitory activity and was the leastcytotoxic, indicating that its activity was not due to general metabolictoxicity, with 96.54% cell viability. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12p70were upregulated while IL-10 expression was inhibited by the extracts. Compoundswere detected using GC-MS analysis, and in both the crude acetone extract and thehexane fraction was the diterpene neophytadiene, which has anti-inflammatory andantimicrobial activity. Finding alternative or complementary approaches todealing with TB infections by, amongst other things, reducing the incidence ofhelminth infestations may lessen the burden of TB, contributing to slowing thespread of multi-drug resistance.","Aro, Abimbola O, Famuyide, Ibukun M, Oyagbemi, Ademola A, Kabongo-Kayoka, Prudence N, McGaw, Lyndy J",2021,Frontiers in pharmacology,2

Here, the C2C12 myoblastcell line and mice were used as in vitro and in vivo models to identify potentialsignaling pathways involved in the adjuvant activity of PD. PD induced atransient cytotoxicity and inflammatory response in the C2C12 cells and in mousequadricep muscles. A comparative analysis of microarray data revealed that PDinduced similar gene expression profiles in the C2C12 cells and in the quadricepmuscles, and triggered rapid regulation of death, immune, andinflammation-related genes, both in vivo and in vitro. It was furtherdemonstrated that caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis was involved in the PD-inducedcytotoxicity and inflammatory response in the C2C12 cells via the Ca(2+)-c-junN-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-NLR familypyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling pathway. Consistently,the in vivo analysis revealed that a local blockage of NLRP3 and caspase-1inhibited PD-induced cytokine production and immune cell recruitment at theinjection site, and impaired the adjuvant activity of PD on antigen-specificimmune responses to model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in mice. These findingsidentified the caspase-1-dependent adjuvanticity of PD and expanded the currentknowledge on the mechanisms of action of saponin-based adjuvants.","Zhu, Liyan, Han, Ziyi, He, Yanfei, Sun, Hongxiang",2022,Cells,2

The aim of this study wasto investigate the effect of Mon on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatorybone loss in mice and osteoclasts (OCs) derived from bone marrow-derivedmacrophages (BMMs), and explore the mechanisms underlying the effect of Mon onLPS-induced osteoclastogenesis. It was found that Mon markedly attenuateddeterioration of the bone micro-architecture, enhanced tissue mineral content(TMC) and bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), reduced structure model index (SMI)and trabecular separation/spacing (Tb.Sp) in the bone tissue and decreased theactivities of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRACP-5b), receptoractivator NF-κB (RANK), and receptor activator NF-κB ligand (RANKL) as well asthe serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) inLPS-treated mice. In addition, Mon treatment reduced the number of TRAP positiveOCs in the bone tissue of LPS-treated mice and also exerted a stronger inhibitoryeffect on formation, differentiation, and F-actin ring construction of OCsderived from BMMs. Mon significantly inhibited the expression of the nuclearfactor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1) and the immediate early gene (C-Fos) andnuclear translocation of NFATc1 in LPS-treated OCs, thereby inhibiting theexpression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), cathepsin K (CtsK), and TRAP.Mon significantly inhibited the expression of TRAF6, phosphorylation of P65, anddegradation of IKBα, thus inhibiting the activation of NF-κB pathway inLPS-induced inflammatory mice and OCs derived from BMMs, and also inhibitedLPS-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and Glycogen synthasekinase 3β (GSK-3β) in OCs derived from BMMs. In conclusion, these resultssuggested that Mon could effectively inhibit osteoclastogenesis both in vitro andin vivo and therefore may prove to be potential option for prevention andtreatment of osteoclastic bone resorption-related diseases.","Zhang, Qi, Hu, Sijing, He, Yuqiong, Song, Zile, Shen, Yi, Zhao, Zihui, Zhang, Quanlong, Qin, Luping, Zhang, Qiaoyan",2022,Nutrients,2

The drug iscurrently produced by purification from the Australian rainforest tree Fontaineapicrosperma (Euphorbiaceae). As part of a selective-breeding program to increaseEBC-46 yield from F. picrosperma plantations, we investigated potential genebiomarkers associated with biosynthesis of EBC-46. Initially, we identifiedindividual plants that were either high (>0.039%) or low EBC-46 (<0.008%)producers, then assessed their differentially expressed genes within the leavesand roots of these two groups by quantitative RNA sequencing. Compared to lowEBC-46 producers, high-EBC-46-producing plants were found to have 145 upregulatedgenes and 101 downregulated genes in leaves and 53 upregulated genes and 82downregulated genes in roots. Most of these genes were functionally associatedwith defence, transport, and biosynthesis. Genes identified as expressedexclusively in either the high or low EBC-46-producing plants were furthervalidated by quantitative PCR, showing that cytochrome P450 94C1 in leaves andearly response dehydration 7.1 and 2-alkenal reductase in roots were consistentlyand significantly upregulated in high-EBC-46 producers.

TA044261,10.3390/molecules27227736,Lycopene Improves Metabolic Disorders and Liver Injury Induced by a Hight-FatDiet in Obese Rats.,"Epidemiological studies have shown that the consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD)is positively related to the development of obesity. Lycopene (LYC) canpotentially combat HFD-induced obesity and metabolic disorders in rats. Thisstudy aimed to investigate the effect of LYC on metabolic syndrome and assess itsanti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects on the liver and adipose tissue in ratsfed an HFD. Thirty-six male Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups.Group Ι (the control group) was fed a normal diet, group ΙΙ (HFD) received an HFDfor 16 weeks, and group ΙΙΙ (HFD + LYC) received an HFD for 12 weeks and then LYC(25 mg/kg b.wt) was administered for four weeks. Lipid peroxidation,antioxidants, lipid profile, liver function biomarkers, and inflammatory markerswere determined. The results showed that long-term consumption of an HFDsignificantly increased weight gain, liver weight, and cholesterol andtriglyceride levels. Rats on an HFD displayed higher levels of lipid peroxidationand inflammatory markers. Moreover, liver and white adipose tissuehistopathological investigations showed that LYC treatment mended the damagedtissue. Overall, LYC supplementation successfully reversed HFD-induced changesand shifts through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, LYCdisplayed a therapeutic potential to manage obesity and its associatedpathologies.","Baz, Lina, Algarni, Salha, Al-Thepyani, Mona, Aldairi, Abdullah, Gashlan, Hana",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA044297,10.1002/vms3.811,Tanshinone IIA enhances the ovarian reserve and attenuates ovarian oxidativestress in aged mice.,"BACKGROUND: Tanshinone IIA (TSA), a major lipophilic component extracted from theroots of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been widely used in China for its variousbiological activities. However, its effect on ovarian reserve in aged mice wasnot studied elsewhere. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the effect of TSAon the ovarian reserve of aged mice as well as young mice. Forty weeks old mice(N = 40) were considered as aged group compared to 4 weeks old mice (N = 40), andthese groups were subdivided into four subgroups (N = 10) to receive differentdoses of TSA (0, 10, 20, and 40 μg/g/day). METHODS: The effect of TSA wasevaluated by counting follicular number by histological examination. Basal serumlevels of FSH, LH, E2, and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) were measured by ELISA.Moreover, the expression levels of antioxidant genes (CAT, Nrf2, GPX1), gapjunction (Cx37), ERK1/2, and Smad5 family gene were examined at both mRNA (qPCR)and protein levels (western blot). RESULTS: Follicular number, level of AMH andE2, and the expression of CAT, Nrf2, and GPX1 genes increased significantly(p < 0.05) in aged mice administrated with medium (20 μg/g/day) and high (40μg/g/day) doses of TSA, whereas FSH and LH levels were significantly low comparedto low dose (10 μg/g/day) and control (0 μg/g/day) aged subgroups. However, wedid not observe any effect of all doses of TSA on young mice. CONCLUSIONS:Administration of TSA with medium and high doses up-regulates the expression ofantioxidative genes, reduces the oxidative injury, increases levels of AMH, andE2 levels that are relatively comparable to those in young mice, and consequentlyresults in a healthy oocyte development.","Bai, Lin, He, Guozhen, Gao, Chenghai, Yang, Hua, Li, Mingxing, Huang, Yulin, Moussa, Mahmoud, Xu, Changlong",2022,Veterinary medicine and science,2

Ithas promising activity against cancer and inflammatory diseases, and could serveas a potential therapeutic alternative since most therapeutic agents have severeside effects that impair quality of life. METHOD: The current study identifiedthe active metabolites from the myrrh resin methanolic extract. Then, theextracts were tested for in vitro anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activityusing cancer cell lines and Tamm-Horsfall Protein 1 (Thp-1)-like macrophage celllines. Furthermore, using an in vivo rat model, the extracts' anti-inflammatoryand wound-healing activity was investigated. In addition, in silico predictionsof the myrrh constituents highlighted the pharmacokinetic properties, moleculartargets, and safety profile, including cytochrome P 450 (CYP) inhibition andorgan toxicity. RESULTS: Nine secondary metabolites were identified, andcomputational predictions suggested a good absorption profile, anticancer,anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing effects. The myrrh extract had moderatecytotoxic activity against both HL60 and K562 leukemia cell lines and the KAIMRC1breast cancer cell line. Myrrh caused a dose-dependent effect on macrophages toincrease the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, promote their polarization toclassically activated macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated macrophages(M2) phenotypes, and consequently induce apoptosis, highlighting its ability tomodulate macrophage function, which could potentially aid in several desiredtherapeutic processes, including the resolution of inflammation, and autophagywhich is an important aspect to consider in cancer treatment. The topicalapplication of myrrh improved wound healing, with no delayed inflammatoryresponse, and promoted complete re-epithelization of the skin, similar to thepositive control. In conclusion, we provide evidence for the methanolic extractof myrrh having cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and anti-inflammatorywound-healing properties, which may be attributed to its role in modulatingmacrophage function. Furthermore, we suggest the active constituents responsiblefor these properties, which warrants further studies focusing on the preciseroles of the active metabolites.","Suliman, Rasha Saad, Alghamdi, Sahar Saleh, Ali, Rizwan, Aljatli, Dimah, Aljammaz, Norah Abdulaziz, Huwaizi, Sarah, Suliman, Rania, Kahtani, Khawla Mohammed, Albadrani, Ghadeer M, Barhoumi, Tlili, Altolayyan, Abdulelah, Rahman, Ishrat",2022,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA044322,10.3390/nu14153042,Ginsenoside Rh4 Suppresses Metastasis of Esophageal Cancer and Expression ofc-Myc via Targeting the Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.,"The metastasis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a leading cause ofdeath worldwide, however, it has a poor prognosis. Ginsenoside Rh4 is a raresaponin that has been shown to have potential antitumor effectiveness in ESCC.However, the utility of Rh4 in ESCC metastasis and its undiscovered mode ofaction has not yet been explored. In this study, we found that Rh4 could inhibitESCC metastasis by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the levelof c-Myc, which is an important transcription factor in cancer. In in vitroexperiments, Rh4 could inhibit the migration and invasion of ESCC cells withoutaffecting cell viability. In in vivo experiments, Rh4 restrained ESCC metastasisto the lymph nodes and lungs via the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymaltransition (EMT). The Wnt agonist HLY78 promoted EMT and migration of ESCC cells,whereas treatment of Rh4 can attenuate the promotion effect of HLY78. The siRNAknocking out c-Myc can also significantly reduce the expression of EMT-relatedmarker proteins. This study illustrates a new concept for further research on themechanism of Rh4 in ESCC.","Chen, Jun, Duan, Zhiguang, Liu, Yannan, Fu, Rongzhan, Zhu, Chenhui",2022,Nutrients,2
TA044344,10.1007/s11064-022-03668-z,Study on Antidepressant Effect and Mechanism of Crocin Mediated by the mTORSignaling Pathway.,"Crocin is a monomer of Chinese traditional herbs extracted from saffron,relieving depression-like behavior. However, its underlying mechanism of actionremains unclear. Herein, we explored whether crocin's antidepressant effectdepended on the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Themodel of PC12 cells injury was established by corticosterone, the changes in cellsurvival rate were tested by the CCK-8 method, and the changes in cellularmorphology were observed under a fluorescence microscope. The depression modelwas established by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and itsantidepressant effect was estimated by open field test (OFT), forced swimmingtest (FST), and tail suspension test (TST). Western blot was used to monitor theprotein expression. The results showed that crocin could effectively improve cellsurvival rate and cellular synaptic growth, alleviate the depressive behavior ofCUMS mice, and promote the expression of BDNF, P-mTOR, P-ERK, and PSD95. However,when rapamycin was pretreated, the antidepressant effects of crocin wereinhibited. In summary, crocin plays a significant antidepressant effect. Afterpretreatment with rapamycin, the anti-depression effect of crocin wassignificantly inhibited. It is suggested that the mechanism of theanti-depression effect of crocin may be related to the mTOR signaling pathway.","Wang, Yan, Zhou, Sixu, Song, Xujiao, Ding, Shanshan, Wang, Baogui, Wen, Jiangfeng, Chen, Chunlin",2022,Neurochemical research,2

Astaxanthine (AST) is known to havestrong antioxidant effects. In this study, the aim is to investigate the effectof AST against hearing loss that is due to DM. METHODS: This study is anexperimental animal study. The study was designed in four groups with 8 animals(n = 8) in each group. The groups were as follows; Control Group (CNT), DiabeticGroup (DM), AST applied diabetic group (DM+AST), and AST applied non-diabeticgroup (AST). Streptozotocin was applied in rats to induce DM. AST wasadministered by oral gavage. Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) and DistortionProduct Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) tests were performed on several days of thestudy. At the end of the study, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were analyzed incochlear tissue samples, and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), Superoxide Dismutase(SOD), Catalase (CAT) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. RESULTS:When the findings obtained in the ABR and DPOAE tests in the DM group, it wasobserved that there was a significant deterioration in the hearing sense. Thisdeterioration was not observed in the DM+AST group. In the DM group, GPx, SOD andCAT levels decreased and MDA levels increased in blood and cochlear tissue.Compared to the DM group, it was noted that antioxidant enzyme levels increasedand MDA levels decreased in the DM+AST group. Cochlear tissue pro-inflammatorycytokine levels, which increased with DM, were significantly decreased in theDM+AST group. CONCLUSION: Even though the effects of AST were investigated in adiabetic experimental animal model, if this molecule is proven to be effective indiabetic humans, it can be considered an adjunct therapeutic option with itsantioxidant effects.

TA044384,10.1155/2022/6151847,Trametenolic Acid Ameliorates the Progression of Diabetic Nephropathy in db/dbMice via Nrf2/HO-1 and NF-κB-Mediated Pathways.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a fatal complication of diabetes and the main causeof end-stage renal disease. Due to the suboptimal effects of current treatments,there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies for DN.Trametenolic acid (TA), a lanostane-type tetracyclic triterpenoid, is one of themain active ingredients extracted from the natural product Inonotus obliquus. Ourstudy was aimed at clarifying the potential protective effects of TA on DN andits underlying mechanism. In this research, C57BLKS/db (db/db) mice were used asthe spontaneous DN model, and TA (10 mg/kg/d) was intraperitoneally injected for4 consecutive weeks. Ratio of right kidney weight/body weight was calculated, andthe contents of serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urinealbumin were detected. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase(CAT) and the contents of reductive glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA)were measured. The histopathological changes of renal tissues were observed byhematoxylin and eosin (HE), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Masson staining. Theprotein expressions of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1), nuclear factorkappa B (NF-κB), proinflammation cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Nephrin, and Podocin were detectedby western blot assay. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to detect expressions ofcollagen III (COL-III) and fibronectin (FN). Our results showed that TAadministration significantly reduced the ratio of right kidney weight/bodyweight, BUN, Scr, and urine albumin levels and alleviated the histopathologicalchanges of DN mice. Moreover, TA administration remarkably increased GSH contentand SOD and CAT activities and decreased MDA content. Western blot assaydemonstrated that TA activated Nrf2 signaling and increased the expression ofdownstream antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and NQO-1. Further studies illustrated thatNF-κB signaling was inhibited, and downstream proinflammation cytokineexpressions of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were also downregulated. In addition, wealso found that TA administration significantly increased the expression ofnephrin and podocin proteins and reduced the protein expression of COL-III andFN. These findings suggested that TA exhibited a renoprotective effect byameliorating oxidative stress and inflammation via Nrf2/HO-1 and NF-κB signalingpathways.","Duan, Qi, Tian, Lingling, Feng, Jiabing, Ping, Xinbo, Li, Lihong, Yaigoub, Hasnaa, Li, Rongshan, Li, Yafeng",2022,Journal of immunology research,2
TA044418,10.1186/s12870-022-03467-2,Comparative metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals a coexpressionnetwork of the carotenoid metabolism pathway in the panicle of Setaria italica.,"BACKGROUND: The grains of foxtail millet are enriched in carotenoids, which endowthis plant with a yellow color and extremely high nutritional value. However, theunderlying molecular regulation mechanism and gene coexpression network remainunclear. METHODS: The carotenoid species and content were detected by HPLC fortwo foxtail millet varieties at three panicle development stages. Based on ahomologous sequence BLAST analysis, these genes related to carotenoid metabolismwere identified from the foxtail millet genome database. The conserved proteindomains, chromosome locations, gene structures and phylogenetic trees wereanalyzed using bioinformatics tools. RNA-seq was performed for these samples toidentify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A Pearson correlation analysiswas performed between the expression of genes related to carotenoid metabolismand the content of carotenoid metabolites. Furthermore, the expression levels ofthe key DEGs were verified by qRT-PCR. The gene coexpression network wasconstructed by a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). RESULT: Themajor carotenoid metabolites in the panicles of DHD and JG21 were lutein andβ-carotene. These carotenoid metabolite contents sharply decreased during thepanicle development stage. The lutein and β-carotene contents were highest at theS1 stage of DHD, with values of 11.474 μg /100 mg and 12.524 μg /100 mg,respectively. Fifty-four genes related to carotenoid metabolism were identifiedin the foxtail millet genome. Cis-acting element analysis showed that these genepromoters mainly contain 'plant hormone', 'drought stress resistance', 'MYBbinding site', 'endosperm specific' and 'seed specific' cis-acting elements andespecially the 'light-responsive' and 'ABA-responsive' elements. In thecarotenoid metabolic pathways, SiHDS, SiHMGS3, SiPDS and SiNCED1 were more highlyexpressed in the panicle of foxtail millet. The expression of SiCMT, SiAACT3,SiPSY1, SiZEP1/2, and SiCCD8c/8d was significantly correlated with the luteincontent. The expression of SiCMT, SiHDR, SiIDI2, SiAACT3, SiPSY1, and SiZEP1/2was significantly correlated with the content of β-carotene. WGCNA showed thatthe coral module was highly correlated with lutein and β-carotene, and 13structural genes from the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway were identified.Network visualization revealed 25 intramodular hub genes that putatively controlcarotenoid metabolism. CONCLUSION: Based on the integrative analysis of thetranscriptomics and carotenoid metabonomics, we found that DEGs related tocarotenoid metabolism had a stronger correlation with the key carotenoidmetabolite content. The correlation analysis and WGCNA identified and predictedthe gene regulation network related to carotenoid metabolism. These results laythe foundation for exploring the key target genes regulating carotenoidmetabolism flux in the panicle of foxtail millet. We hope that these target genescould be used to genetically modify millet to enhance the carotenoid content inthe future.","Li, Hui, Han, Shangling, Huo, Yiqiong, Ma, Guifang, Sun, Zhaoxia, Li, Hongying, Hou, Siyu, Han, Yuanhuai",2022,BMC plant biology,2

The use of essential oil compounds in pest management hasbeen proposed as an alternative to harmful chemical insecticides that disturbhuman health and ecosystem functioning. We examined the antifeedant activity ofthree concentrations (0.125%, 0.25% and 0.5%) of pure camphor and athujone-camphor mixture against 3rd instar larvae and adults. Their efficacy wasevaluated according to the degree of leaf damage and avoidance of treated leavesby the CPB. Treatment of potato leaves significantly reduced leaf damage comparedto the control. Leaf protection increased at higher concentrations of theexamined compounds. Camphor was more effective against larvae and thethujone-camphor mixture was more effective against adults. Additionally, adultsmoved faster towards the control leaf disc in the two-choice olfactometer assayif an alternative disc was treated with a thujone-camphor mixture, whereas larvaeresponded similarly to the two potential repellents. However, after contact withthe leaf disc treated with the highest compound concentration, the larvae escapedfaster from the thujone-camphor mixture than from pure camphor. In conclusion,both examined compounds are promising eco-friendly antifeedants, but theirefficacy depends on the developmental stage of the beetle, compound type andapplied concentration.","Lazarević, Jelica, Kostić, Igor, Šešlija Jovanović, Darka, Ćalić, Dušica, Milanović, Slobodan, Kostić, Miroslav",2022,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2

The therapeutic applications can be expanded by improving itsbioavailability. The 7-O-terpenylated wogonin consisting one to three prenylunits are chemically synthesized for increasing lipophilic nature for efficientuptake, and also an attempt in mimicry of naturally scarce terpenylatedflavonoids found in limited plant families and bee propolis. Wogonin (W) and itslipophilic nature prenyl wogonin (W5), geranyl wogonin (W10), and farnesylwogonin (W15) were comparatively studied with structure-relationship inimmunotoxicity of cell livability on lymphoid, myeloid, and somatic origins celllines. Anti-inflammatory functions characterized with nitric oxide inhibition andintracellular ROS level of LPS-activated murine macrophage RAW264.7 wereassessed. Wogonin and its terpenylated derivatives have selectively influencedlivability of lymphoid origin cells but not myeloid and somatic origin cells. Themitotic protein survivin gene expressions analysis further supported theselective suppressions on lymphoid origin YAC-1 cells by wogonin and geranylwogonin, while oppositely boosted survivin expressions in LPS-activatedmacrophages. Moreover, wogonin exhibits dose-dependent inhibition on the nitricoxide (NO) production and iNOS gene expressions of LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells.Terpenylated wogonin exhibits profoundly superior control in intracellular ROSlevel and a sustained action with sound cell integrity than the wogonin. Theenhanced cellular uptake with higher lipophilicity to membrane of7-O-terpenylated wogonin may pose an important biological nature in facilitatingbetter bioavailability and specific immunomodulatory actions of the category ofterpenylated flavonoids. The 7-O-terpenylated wogonin having biological merit offast membrane lipid bilayer integration, lower effective concentration, andbetter preserving immune cells functions and livability deserved further in-depthinvestigations and their broadly therapeutic applications.","Wu, Jin-Yi, Chen, Lih-Geeng, Hu, Chia-Wen, Chiu, Kuan-Chi, Lin, Wenhsin, Ho, Pei-Chun, Weng, Brian Bor-Chun",2022,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA044483,10.1073/pnas.2210081119,The squalene route to C30 carotenoid biosynthesis and the origins of carotenoidbiosynthetic pathways.,"Carotenoids are isoprenoid lipids found across the tree of life with importantimplications in oxidative stress adaptations, photosynthetic metabolisms, as wellas in membrane dynamics. The canonical view is that C40 carotenoids aresynthesized from phytoene and C30 carotenoids from diapophytoene. Squalene ismostly associated with the biosynthesis of polycyclic triterpenes, although therehave been suggestions that it could also be involved in the biosynthesis of C30carotenoids. However, demonstration of the existence of this pathway in nature islacking. Here, we demonstrate that C30 carotenoids are synthesized from squalenein the Planctomycetes bacteria and that this squalene route to C30 carotenoids isthe most widespread in prokaryotes. Using the evolutionary history of carotenoidand squalene amino oxidases, we propose an evolutionary scenario to explain theorigin and diversification of the different carotenoid and squalene-relatedpathways. We show that carotenoid biosynthetic pathways have been constantlytransferred and neofunctionalized during prokaryotic evolution. One possibleorigin of the squalene pathway connects it with the one of C40 carotenoidsynthesis of Cyanobacteria. The widespread occurrence of the squalene route toC30 carotenoids in Bacteria increases the functional repertoire of squalene,establishing it as a general hub of carotenoids and polycyclic triterpenessynthesis.","Santana-Molina, Carlos, Henriques, Valentina, Hornero-Méndez, Damaso, Devos, Damien P, Rivas-Marin, Elena",2022,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2

Forthe selected nanoparticles of ~100 nm in diameter, the loading capacity to thevolatile fragrances was in the order of P-PMO < E-PMO < MSN, consistent with thetrend of increasing total pore volume. For example, P-PMO, E-PMO, and MSN had aLim uptake of 42.2 wt%, 47.3 wt%, and 62.7 wt%, respectively, which was close totheir theoretical adsorption capacity. Under isothermal thermogravimetricanalysis conditions (30 °C, a N2 flow of 1 mL min−1), the lowest fragrancerelease of ~56% over 24 h was observed for P-PMO, followed by E-PMO (74−80%), andMSN (~89%). The release kinetics of the fragrant molecules from MSN and PMOmaterials can be well described by first-order and Weibull models, respectively.Moreover, the incorporation of Lim-loaded P-PMO NPs in an aqueous solution ofregenerated silk fibroin provided a composite coating material suitable forperishable fruit preservation. The active layer deposited on fruit peels usingdip coating showed good preservation efficacy, enabling the shelf-life of mangoesin a highly humid and hot atmosphere (30−35 °C, 75−85% RH) to be extended to 6days.","Zhao, Yuanjiang, Bai, Tianwen, Liu, Yuhang, Lv, Yichao, Zhou, Zhuxian, Shen, Youqing, Jiang, Liming",2022,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2

This limits their clinicalusefulness and remain to be solved, and calls for investigations of new andbetter compounds. The experimental plant, Euclea racemosa L. (E. racemosa L) isamong plants, which are used for management of constipation traditionally but itseffect is not yet experimentally validated. Therefore, the aim of the presentstudy is to investigate the laxative effects of this plant. METHODS: The laxativeeffects of aqueous root extracts of E. racemosa L. were evaluated usinggastrointestinal motility, laxative activity, and gastrointestinal secretiontests. RESULTS: In the laxative test, the 200 and 400 mg/kg doses of plantextract showed a significant increase in percent fecal water content. The plantextract also significantly accelerated the charcoal meal in gastrointestinalmotility test of loperamide-constipated mice. Moreover, the experimental plantproduced significant Gastrointestinal (GI) transit ratio at all doses but failedto produce a significantly higher fluid accumulation except 400 mg/kg doses ofextract in gastrointestinal secretion test. The observed effect of the aqueousroot extract might be due to the presence of secondary metabolites. The aqueousroot extract of E. racemosa L. revealed the presence of terpenes, saponins,flavonoids and phenols when it was subjected to phytochemical screening.CONCLUSION: The investigation obtained from this study suggested that E. racemosaL. has a beneficial effect in producing laxative effect and this substantiate thetraditional use of the plant for its claimed indication.","Ayele, Akeberegn Gorems, Mulugeta, Brooktawit, Wondmkun, Yohannes Tsegyie",2023,Metabolism open,2

However,little is known about the biological activities of its aerial part's essentialoil during the vegetative period. Thus, the purpose of this work was to determinethe chemical composition and evaluate the antioxidant and antibacterial potenciesof the essential oil extracted from A. ordosica aerial parts during thevegetative stage. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)revealed that spathulenol (9.93%) and α-curcumene (9.24%), both sesquiterpenes,were the most abundant of the 74 chemical constituents detected in the essentialoil of A. ordosica. The antioxidant activity of the essential oil was found to berelatively moderate against 2,2-diphenylhydrazyl (DPPH),2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and hydroxylradical (OH(●)) radicals. The essential oil exhibited strong antibacterialactivity against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella abony and Escherichia coli,with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 2.5, 5, and 10 μL/mL,respectively. The results indicate that the essential oil of A. ordosicapossesses notable antibacterial properties as well as antioxidant capability andcan thus be employed as a natural ingredient which can be used as a substitutefor antibiotics in the animal feed industry.

The interaction between miR-let-7c and long non-coding RNA Xinactive-specific transcript (XIST) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) was verified bydual-luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS: CuB treatment inhibited theproliferation of lung cancer cells and promoted cell apoptosis, and increased theexpression of Bax and cleaved caspase3, decreased cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 expression.CuB suppressed XIST and IL-6 expression, and enhanced miR-let-7c expression. XISTsilencing enhanced the inhibitory effect of CuB on cell proliferation and thepromotion effect on apoptosis via upregulating miR-let-7c. Moreover, XISTtargeted miR-let-7c to activate the IL-6/STAT axis. MiR-let-7c overexpressionenhanced the regulatory effect of CuB on proliferation and apoptosis viasuppressing the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: CuB regulated cellproliferation and apoptosis by inhibiting the XIST/miR-let-7c/IL-6/STAT3 axis inlung cancer. These findings indicate CuB may have the possibility of clinicalapplication in lung cancer treatment.","Liu, Jian-Hua, Li, Chen, Cao, Liang, Zhang, Chang-Hong, Zhang, Zhi-Hua",2022,Pharmaceutical biology,2

In this study, we investigated whether theginsenoside protopanaxadiol relieves chloroquine-induced retinopathy by restoringlysosomotropic abnormalities in human adult retinal pigment epithelial-19 cells.Cytotoxicity was assessed using a3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Morphologicalalterations in autophagosomes of adult retinal pigment epithelial-19 cells wasdetected using confocal microscopy. Apoptosis was examined using flow cytometry,whereas cellular reactive oxygen species levels were determined by measuring thefluorescence intensity of 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2'-7'-dichlorohydrofluoresceindiacetate. Lysosomal function was assessed by measuring lysosomal pH and enzymeactivity. Immunoprecipitation and western blotting analyses were performed. Adultretinal pigment epithelial-19 cells accumulated autophagosomes with fusiondefects in lysosomes and reactive oxygen species formation following exposure tochloroquine. This effect trapped Beclin-1 and B-cell lymphoma 2 interfering withautophagy initiation and autophagosome development. Protopanaxadiol alleviatedchloroquine-induced toxicity by modulating the interaction between Beclin-1 andBcl-2, which was mediated by the AMP-activated protein kinase-mammalian target ofrapamycin signal axis. Furthermore, autophagy and apoptosis were simultaneouslycontrolled by protopanaxadiol via upregulation of autophagy flux and decreasedreactive oxygen species formation and apoptotic protein expression. Thesefindings suggest that protopanaxadiol is a promising treatment strategy forchloroquine-mediated retinopathy.","Lee, Haesung, Nguyen Hoang, Anh Thu, Lee, Sook-Jeong",2022,PloS one,2

Their treatmentis often ineffective due to the resistance of yeasts to antimycotics. Therefore,there is a need to search for new antifungals. The aim of this study was todetermine the antifungal effect of clove essential oil (CEO) and eugenol (EUG)towards both reference and clinical Candida spp. strains isolated from the oralcavity of patients with hematological malignancies, and to investigate their modeof action and the interactions in combination with the selected antimycotics.These studies were performed using the broth microdilution method, tests withsorbitol and ergosterol, and a checkerboard technique, respectively. The CEO andEUG showed activity against all Candida strains with a minimal inhibitoryconcentration (MIC) in the range of 0.25-2 mg/mL. It was also found that bothnatural products bind to ergosterol in the yeast cell membrane. Moreover, theinteractions between CEO and EUG with several antimycotics-cetylpyridiniumchloride, chlorhexidine, silver nitrate and triclosan-showed synergistic oradditive effects in combination, except nystatin.

However,the chemical and pharmacological properties were rarely reported. Therefore, inthis work, we used a steam distillation method to obtain essential oils fromleaves of E. grandis × E. urophylla, and further evaluated the antioxidant,antimicrobial, and phytotoxic potential of the essential oil. Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to investigate the chemical composition ofE. grandis × E. urophylla essential oil (EEO) and the results showed that themain components of EEO were monoterpenes followed by sesquiterpenes. Among them,α-pinene accounted about 17.02%. EEO could also well scavenge1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radicals showinga good free radical clearance ability. In addition, EEO efficiently inhibited thegrowth of six kinds of bacteria as well as seven kinds of plant pathogens,especially Salmonella typhimurium and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Moreover,the seedling germination of Raphanus sativus, Lactuca sativa, Lolium perenne, andBidens pilosa was significantly suppressed by EEO, thus, indicating essentialoils from eucalyptus possessed an excellent phytotoxic activity. This study maygive a better understanding on EEO and provide a pharmacological activitiesanalysis contributing to the further research of EEO as a functional drug inagronomic and cosmetic industries.","Zhou, Lijun, Li, Jiajia, Kong, Qingbo, Luo, Siyuan, Wang, Jie, Feng, Shiling, Yuan, Ming, Chen, Tao, Yuan, Shu, Ding, Chunbang",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

We used fenchone, 1,8-cineol and α-pinene, and soils fromphrygana, a typical Mediterranean-type ecosystem where aromatic plants abound,and from another five ecosystem types, focusing on culturable bacteria. Patternsof response were common to all ecosystems, but responses themselves were notalways as pronounced in phrygana as in the other ecosystems, suggesting thatthese enrichments are less of a disturbance there. More specifically, soilrespiration and abundance of the bacterial communities increased, becoming frombelow two up to 16 times as high as in control soils (for both attributes) andremained at high levels as long as these compounds were present. Bacteria thatcan utilize these three compounds as substrates of growth became dominant membersof the bacterial communities in the enriched soils. All changes were readilyreversible once monoterpene addition stopped. Bacteria with the ability toutilize these monoterpenes as carbon sources were found in soils from allecosystems, 15 strains in total, suggesting a rather universal presence; ofthese, six could also utilize the organic pollutants toluene or p-xylene. Theseresults suggest also potential novel applications of monoterpenes in combatingsoil pollution.","Chalkos, Dimitris, Karamanoli, Katerina, Vokou, Despoina",2021,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2

VOOs produced at anindustrial scale in different olive mills of the Chalkidiki (Greece) regionalunit as well as VOOs obtained at the laboratory scale from drupes of differentmaturity stages for four consecutive harvesting years were examined for theirsqualene (SQ) content using both HPLC and GC procedures. The mean values of SQwere found to be 4228 (HPLC) and 4865 (GC) mg/kg oil (n = 15) and were of thesame magnitude as that in VOOs from cv Koroneiki (4134 mg/kg, n = 23). Storage ofVOOs in the dark at room temperature for 18 months indicated an insignificantmean SQ content loss (~2%) in comparison to a mean loss of 26% foralpha-tocopherol content. This finding strengthens our view that SQ does not actas a radical scavenger that donates hydrogen atoms to the latter. The fourconsecutive harvest years studied indicated a clear declining trend in VOO SQconcentration upon olive ripening.

Genetic, environmental,and nutrition factors have been suggested as contributors to oxidative stress andneuroinflammation events that are connected to AD etiology, and secondarymetabolites, such as triterpenes, have shown promising results in AD prevention.In this work, the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory potential of an oliveleaves fraction enriched in triterpenoid compounds obtained using supercriticalfluid extraction (SFE) and dynamic adsorption/desorption using sea sand asadsorbent has been performed. In addition, a comprehensive lipidomics study ofthe response of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line to this fraction was carried outusing advanced analytical methodologies, namely, charged-surface hybridchromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (CSH-Q-TOF MS/MS). Theuse of freely available lipidomic annotation tools and databases, and stringentcut-off filters allowed the annotation of more than 250 intracellular lipids.Advanced bioinformatics and statistical tools showed a number ofphosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines significantly increased, whichcould explain the protection against the cell death caused by Aβ1-42.

Only sclareol showed synergistic activity withclindamycin. The quantification of these compounds by LC-MS analysis in theorgans and in the calli of S. tingitana showed that sclareol is most abundant inthe flower spikes and is produced by calli, while manool is the major labdane ofthe roots, and is abundant also in the leaves. Other metabolites of the rootswere abietane diterpenoids, common in Salvia species, and pentacyclictriterpenoids, bearing a γ-lactone moiety, previously undescribed in Salvia.Docking simulations suggested that 1 and 2 bind to key residues, involved indirect interactions with DNA.

Duringcontact with microorganisms on the surface of these materials, a microbialbiofilm is formed. The biofilm structure is difficult to remove and promotes thedevelopment of pathogenic bacteria. For this reason, the inhibition of biofilmformation in medical and food production environments is very important. For thispurpose, five naturally occurring compounds were used for antimicrobial screeningtests. The two with the best antimicrobial properties were chosen to inhibit thebiofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After 3days of exposure, thymol reduced the amount of biofilm of Pseudomonas aeruginosawithin the range of 70-77% and 52-75% for Staphylococcus aureus. Carvacrolinhibited the formation of biofilms by up to 74-88% for Pseudomonas aeruginosaand up to 86-100% for Staphylococcus aureus. Those phenols decreased the enzymeactivity of the biofilm by up to 40-100%. After 10 days of exposure to thymol,biofilm formation was reduced by 80-100% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and by about79-100% for Staphylococcus aureus.

In this context, there is a growinginterest in exploring plants to find new natural antioxidants to prevent theappearance and the development of these muscle disorders. In this study, weinvestigated the antioxidant properties of Arctium lappa leaves in a model ofprimary human muscle cells exposed to H(2)O(2) oxidative stress. We identifiedusing bioassay-guided purification, onopordopicrin, a sesquiterpene lactone asthe main molecule responsible for the antioxidant activity of A. lappa leafextract. According to our findings, onopordopicrin inhibited theH(2)O(2)-mediated loss of muscle cell viability, by limiting the production offree radicals and abolishing DNA cellular damages. Moreover, we showed thatonopordopicrin promoted the expression of the nuclear factor-erythroid-2-relatedfactor 2 (Nrf2) downstream target protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in musclecells. By using siRNA, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the expression ofNrf2 reduced the protective effect of onopordopicrin, indicating that theactivation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway mediates the antioxidant effect ofonopordopicrin in primary human muscle cells. Therefore, our results suggest thatonopordopicrin may be a potential therapeutic molecule to fight against oxidativestress in pathological specific muscle disorders.","El Khatib, Nour, Morel, Sylvie, Hugon, Gérald, Rapior, Sylvie, Carnac, Gilles, Saint, Nathalie",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

An in vitro batchfermentation experiment (Exp. 1) tested the addition of all of the substances (2essential oils and 3 compounds) in fermentation bottles (120 mL) at 48 h ofincubation, whereas a subsequent in vitro continuous culture experiment (Exp. 2)evaluated the pure compounds added to the fermenters (2 L) for a longerincubation period (9 d). In both experiments, total mixed rations were incubatedwith the additives, and samples without additives were included as the control(CTR). Each treatment was tested in duplicate and was repeated in 3 and 2fermentation runs in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. Gas production (GP) in Exp. 1was similar for all of the treatments, and short chain volatile fatty acid (SCFA)production was similar in both experiments except for a decrease of SCFA produced(P = 0.029) due to EUCA addition in Exp. 2. Compared to CTR, BOR and CAM reducedthe valerate proportion (P = 0.04) in Exp. 1, and increased (P < 0.01) theacetate proportion in Exp. 2. All treatments increased (P < 0.01) total protozoacounts (+36.7% and +48.4% compared to CTR on average for Exp. 1 and 2,respectively). In Exp. 1, all of the treatments lowered the Bacteroidetes andFirmicutes and increased the Proteobacteria relative abundances (P < 0.05),whereas in Exp. 2, the EUCA addition increased (P = 0.012) the Ruminococcus.

TA045153,10.3892/ijmm.2021.4901,Alantolactone suppresses the metastatic phenotype and induces the apoptosis ofglioblastoma cells by targeting LIMK kinase activity and activating thecofilin/G‑actin signaling cascade.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive brain tumor and is associatedwith an extremely poor prognosis, as the current standard of care treatments havelimited efficacy. Natural compounds have attracted increasing attention aspotential anticancer drugs. Alantolactone (ATL) is a natural small moleculeinhibitor, that has antitumor properties. In the present study, U87MG and U251cells were treated ATL and changes in actin/G‑actin/F‑actin/cofilin pathway weredetected in whole cells, in the cytoplasm and mitochondria by western blotanalysis. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analysis identified changesin the expression levels of target proteins and interactions, respectively. ALIMK enzyme inhibitor was also applied to assess the effects of ATL on themigration and invasion of GBM cells. Flow cytometry was used to detect the levelsof apoptosis of GBM cells. The expression of matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP)‑2/MMP‑9, caspase‑3/caspase‑9/poly(ADP‑ribose) polymerase(PARP)/cytochrome c, were determined by western blot analysis to assess theeffects of targeting LIMK. The in vitro findings were verified in vivo bycharacterizing changes in the expression of cofilin/LIMK in xenograft tumors inimmunodeficient mice. It was found that ATL activated cofilin through thetargeted inhibition of LIMK enzyme activity and it thus upregulated the ratio ofG/F actin, and inhibited GBM cell migration and invasion. Conversely, theactivation of cofilin and G‑actin could be co‑transferred to the mitochondria toinitiate the mitochondrial‑cytochrome c pathway to induce apoptosis. On thewhole, the findings of the present study further illustrate the molecularmechanisms through which ATL inhibits the metastatic phenotype of GBM cells andinduces apoptosis. Given previous findings, it can be deduced that ATL canfunction through multiple pathways and has multiple targets in GBM models,highlighting its potential for use in clinical applications.","Wang, Xun, Zou, Shuang, Ren, Tong, Zhao, Li-Jun, Yu, Li-Fei, Li, Xiang-Yu, Yan, Xin, Zhang, Li-Jun",2021,International journal of molecular medicine,2

The presence of species belongingto the genus Baccharis is of particular interest, as these species have shownpromise in pest management applications. The objective of this study is tochemically identify the constituents expressed in the leaves of seven species ofBaccharis (B. anomala DC., B. calvescens DC., B. mesoneura DC., B. millefloraDC., B. oblongifolia Pers., B. trimera (Less) DC. and B. uncinella DC.) and toevaluate the toxicological and morphological effects caused by essential oils(EOs) on the larvae and adults of Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae).Chemical analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicatedthat limonene was the main common constituent in all Baccharis species. Thisconstituent in isolation, as well as the EOs of B. calvescens, B. mesoneura, andB. oblongifolia, caused mortality in over 80% of adults of D. suzukii at adiscriminatory concentration of 80 mg L(-1) in bioassays of ingestion and topicalapplication. These results are similar to the effect of spinosyn-based syntheticinsecticides (spinetoram 75 mg L(-1)) 120 h after exposure. Limonene and EOs fromall species had the lowest LC(50) and LC(90) values relative to spinosyn andazadirachtin (12 g L(-1)) in both bioassays. However, they showed the same timetoxicity over time as spinetoram when applied to adults of D. suzukii (LT(50)ranging from 4.6 to 8.7 h) in a topical application bioassay. In olfactometrytests, 92% of D. suzukii females showed repellent behavior when exposed to theEOs and limonene. Likewise, the EOs of B. calvescens, B. mesoneura, and B.oblongifolia significantly reduced the number of eggs in artificial fruits (≅ 7.6eggs fruit(-1)), differing from the control treatment with water (17.2 eggsfruit(-1)) and acetone (17.6 eggs fruit(-1)). According to histological analyses,the L3 larvae of D. suzukii had morphological and physiological alterations anddeformations after exposure to treatments containing EOs and limonene, whichresulted in high larval, pupal, and adult mortality. In view of the results,Baccharis EOs and their isolated constituent, limonene, proved to be promisingalternatives for developing bioinsecticides to manage of D. suzukii.","de Souza, Michele Trombin, de Souza, Mireli Trombin, Bernardi, Daniel, de Melo, Douglas José, Zarbin, Paulo Henrique Gorgatti, Zawadneak, Maria Aparecida Cassilha",2021,Scientific reports,2

New drugdevelopment in thrombosis treatment is still in great demand. According to thetraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, thrombosis belongs to the syndrome ofblood stasis. Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge and Ligusticum striatum DC. are twocommon TCM herbs with long-term documented function in promoting bloodcirculation and inhibiting thrombosis, especially when used together. GuanxinningTablet, a modern Chinese drug which contains extracts of the two herbs, alsoshowed strong therapeutic effects in coronary heart disease. However, thepharmacological mechanism is still lacking for the compatibility of the twoherbs. Here, through zebrafish-based in vivo fluorescence screening, wedemonstrated the synergistic effects between S. miltiorrhiza Bunge and L.striatum DC. in regulating endogenous thrombosis. Moreover, combined withhigh-resolution mass spectrometry, the main compounds of the botanical drugs wereanalyzed and screened in our model system. Interestingly, cryptotanshinone andsenkyunolide I, two representative compounds, respectively derived from the twoherbs, also showed synergistic antithrombotic effects. Further analysis suggestedthat they may regulate thrombi formation at different levels via multiplesignaling pathways, including oxidative stress, platelet activation andcoagulation cascade. Taken together, our findings provided solid biologicalsupports toward the drug compatibility theory of TCM, and suggestedcryptotanshinone and senkyunolide I as promising drug candidates in thrombosismanagement.","Li, Jun, Liu, Hao, Yang, Zhenzhong, Yu, Qingqing, Zhao, Lu, Wang, Yi",2020,Frontiers in pharmacology,2

The main purpose of this study was to assess the effect ofartemisinin derivatives on in vivo parasite clearance according to erythrocytevariants. In vivo response was investigated through retrospective data obtainedover a 42-day artemether-lumefantrine/artesunate amodiaquine efficacy protocolconducted from 2012 to 2016. RESULTS: A total of 770 patients in Côte d'Ivoireattending the hospitals of Anonkoua-koute (Abidjan), Petit Paris (Korhogo),Libreville (Man), Dar es salam (Bouaké), Ayamé and Yamoussoukro with acuteuncomplicated falciparum malaria were selected for successful hemoglobin typing.HbAS, HbSS, HbAC, and HbSC genotypes were found. Parasite clearance time wasobtained for 414 patients. In the population with abnormal hemoglobin, parasitedensities on admission and parasite clearance rates were significantly lower inthe HbSC group compared to HbAA (p = 0.02 and p = 0.007, respectively). After PCRcorrection on day 42, the acute treatment rate was 100% for each group. Parasitehalf-life and time for initial parasitaemia to decline by 50 and 99% were longerfor the HbSC group (p < 0.05). The study also investigated the prevalence ofK13-propeller polymorphisms across different hemoglobin genotype groups. A totalof 185 and 63 samples were sequenced in the HbAA group and patients with abnormalHb, respectively. Only two nonsynonymous mutations D559N and V510M were found inthe HbAA group.

We useda mouse model of SCI, and functional outcomes following injury were assessed.Western blotting, ELISA, and immunofluorescence techniques were employed toanalyze levels of autophagy, mitophagy, pyroptosis, and AMPK-related signalingpathways were also examined. Our results showed that BA significantly improvedfunctional recovery following SCI. Furthermore, autophagy, mitophagy, ROS leveland pyroptosis were implicated in the mechanism of BA in the treatment of SCI.Specifically, our results suggest that BA restored autophagy flux followinginjury, which induced mitophagy to eliminate the accumulation of ROS and inhibitspyroptosis. Further mechanistic studies revealed that BA likely regulatesautophagy and mitophagy via the AMPK-mTOR-TFEB signaling pathway. Those resultsshowed that BA can significantly promote the recovery following SCI and that itmay be a promising therapy for SCI.","Wu, Chenyu, Chen, Huanwen, Zhuang, Rong, Zhang, Haojie, Wang, Yongli, Hu, Xinli, Xu, Yu, Li, Jiafeng, Li, Yao, Wang, Xiangyang, Xu, Hui, Ni, Wenfei, Zhou, Kailiang",2021,International journal of biological sciences,2

The 8-O-(E-p-methoxycinnamoyl)harpagide (MCH) exhibitspharmacological activities that exert neuroprotective, hepatoprotective,anti-inflammatory and other biological effects. However, not have reports ofantiviral effects. To investigate the antiviral activity of MCH on IAV-infectedhuman lung cells mediated by calcium regulation. We examined the inhibitoryeffect of MCH on IAV infections and measured the level of viral proteins upon MCHtreatment using Western blotting. We also performed molecular docking simulationwith MCH and IAV M2 protein. Finally, we analyzed MCH's suppression ofintracellular calcium and ROS (reactive oxygen species) in IAV-infected humanlung cells using a flow cytometer. The results shown that MCH inhibited theinfection of IAV and increased the survival of the infected human lung cells. Thelevels of IAV protein M1, M2, NS1 and PA were inhibited in MCH-treated human lungcells compared to that in infected and untreated cells. Also, docking simulationsuggest that MCH interacted with M2 on its hydrophobic wall (L40 and I42) andpolar amino acids (D44 and R45), which formed intermolecular contacts and were acrucial part of the channel gate along with W41. Lastly, MCH inhibited IAVinfection by reducing intracellular calcium and mitochondrial Ca(2+)/ROS levelsin infected human lung cells. Taken together, these data suggest that MCHinhibits IAV infection and increases the survival of infected human lung cells bysuppressing calcium levels. These results indicate that MCH is useful fordeveloping IAV treatments.","Kwon, Eun-Bin, Yang, Hye-Jin, Kim, Young-Soo, Li, Wei, Choi, Jang-Gi",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA045532,10.3390/molecules26206254,Identification of Volatile Compounds in Blackcurrant Berries: Differences amongCultivars.,"Berries of blackcurrant are known to produce a strong flavor. Some previousstudies have reported that a given cultivar of blackcurrant can produce berrieswith a specific profile of volatile compounds. For the Burgundy region in France,the Noir de Bourgogne cultivar is especially important because it is the mainingredient of a liquor with a designation of origin. The aim of the present studywas to characterize the volatile fractions of berries from 15 cultivars in orderto explore the possibility of using different cultivars for liquor production.The plants were cultivated under the same conditions and harvested in the sameyear. The volatile fractions of the harvested berries were analyzed usingHS-SPME-GC-MS. Thorough univariate statistical analysis and multivariate analysiswere applied to the dataset, which made it possible to identify groups withincultivars. The Rosenthal cultivar exhibited a quite flat profile; the Lositkia,Ben Tiran, and Barchatnaia cultivars shared common features; the Noir deBourgogne cultivar showed the highest amounts of molecules such as 3-carene,limonene, β-phellandrene, ocimene, α-terpinolene, and bicyclogermacrene.

Combinational therapy of natural products (e.g., essential oils,EOs) with conventional antifungals has been suggested as a promising alternativeto overcome this medical problem. The present study investigates the potentialantifungal activity of EOs extracted from some selected medicinal plants, aloneand in combination with two common conventional antifungals (fluconazole andamphotericin B) against four clinical Candida isolates. MIC assays indicated thatEOs induced strong anticandidal activities with MIC values ranging from 0.162 to4.950 mg/mL. The combination of amphotericin B with Thymus leptobotrys, Origanumcompactum and Artemisia herba alba EOs provided a synergistic effect against C.krusei only, with MIC gain of four-fold, and additive effect against remainingstrains (MIC gain = two-fold). Interesting synergistic interactions were observedby combining all studied EOs with fluconazole, with reduction rates of their MICsranging from 16 to 512-fold. This synergistic effect was very pronounced with thecombination of T. leptobotrys EO and fluconazole. These findings indicate thatstudied EOs can be used as anti-candidals in combination with antifungals,particularly fluconazole, to counteract the emergence of resistant Candida spp.","Soulaimani, Bouchra, Varoni, Elena, Iriti, Marcello, Mezrioui, Nour-Eddine, Hassani, Lahcen, Abbad, Abdelaziz",2021,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA045560,10.1097/CM9.0000000000001328,Notoginsenoside R1 attenuates breast cancer progression by targeting CCND2 andYBX3.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a common malignancy with highly femaleincidence. So far the function of notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1), the extract fromPanax notoginseng, has not been clearly elucidated in BC. METHODS: Optimalculture concentration and time of NGR1 were investigated by cell counting kit-8assay. Cell proliferation ability was measured by colony formation assays.Transwell assay was used to detect the effect of NGR1 on cell migration andinvasion. The apoptosis rate of cells between each group was measured by TUNELassay. RESULTS: NGR1 treatment has an inhibitory effect on proliferation,migration, invasion, and angiogenesis and a stimulating effect on cell cyclearrest and apoptosis of Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells. The 50%growth inhibitory concentration for MCF-7 cells at 24 h was 148.9 mmol/L. Theproportions of MCF-7 cells arrested in the G0/G1 phase were 36.94±6.78%,45.06±5.60%, and 59.46±5.60% in the control group, 75, and 150 mmol/L groups,respectively. Furthermore, we revealed that NGR1 treatment attenuates BCprogression by targeted downregulating CCND2 and YBX3 genes. Additionally, YBX3activates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)signaling pathway by activating kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene, which is anactivator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: These results suggestthat NGR1 can act as an efficacious drug candidate that targets the YBX3/PI3K/Aktaxis in patients with BC.","Qin, Hai-Long, Wang, Xue-Jun, Yang, Bi-Xian, Du, Bin, Yun, Xue-Lin",2021,Chinese medical journal,2

The control of these insect pests is an important aspect of theprevention of foodborne diseases, which represent a significant public healththreat worldwide. Among aromatic plants, spices essential oils (EOs) are the mostsuitable to protect food from insect pests. In this study, we determined thechemical composition of three oregano EOs and assessed their toxicity anddeterrence to oviposition against the blowfly Calliphora vomitoria L. Thechemical analyses showed that the EOs belonged to three chemotypes: one with aprevalence of carvacrol, the carvacrol chemotype (CC; carvacrol, 81.5%), and twowith a prevalence of thymol, the thymol/p-cymene and thymol/γ-terpinenechemotypes (TCC and TTC; thymol, 43.8, and 36.7%, respectively).

Materials andMethods: In the present study, the anti-cancer activity of OTEO was examined in ahuman gastric cancer cell line (AGS). After OTEO treatment, AGS cell viabilitywas determined by an MTT assay, and inhibition of metastasis was determined bycell migration and invasion assays. The expression of apoptosis-related genes intreated AGS cells was determined by qRT-PCR. Results: OTEO significantlydecreased AGS cell viability in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50) 163.42 µg/mL) andeffectively inhibited cell migration and invasion. Morphological examinationdemonstrated that OTEO induced cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, andfragmentation, which are considered typical morphologies of apoptotic cell death.Pro-apoptotic genes (TP53, BAX, and BAK) were significantly up-regulated, whileanti-apoptotic genes (BCL-2 and BCL-xL) were significantly down-regulated aftertreatment with OTEO. In addition, significantly increased gene expression wasdetected for CASP8, CASP9, and CASP3 in AGS cells exposed to OTEO. GC-MS analysisdemonstrated that the major compound of OTEO was caryophyllene (25.85%) andα-pinene (11.66%).

TA045766,10.3390/ijms222111486,Ursolic Acid Accelerates Paclitaxel-Induced Cell Death in Esophageal Cancer Cellsby Suppressing Akt/FOXM1 Signaling Cascade.,"Ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid extracted from various plants,inhibits cell growth, metastasis, and tumorigenesis in various cancers.Chemotherapy resistance and the side effects of paclitaxel (PTX), a traditionalchemotherapy reagent, have limited the curative effect of PTX in esophagealcancer. In this study, we investigate whether UA promotes the anti-tumor effectof PTX and explore the underlying mechanism of their combined effect inesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Combination treatment with UA and PTXinhibited cell proliferation and cell growth more effectively than eithertreatment alone by inducing more significant apoptosis, as indicated by increasedsub-G1 phase distribution and protein levels of cleaved-PARP and cleavedcaspase-9. Similar to the cell growth suppressive effect, the combination of UAand PTX significantly inhibited cell migration by targeting uPA, MMP-9, andE-cadherin in ESCC cells. In addition, combination treatment with UA and PTXsignificantly activated p-GSK-3β and suppressed the activation of Akt and FOXM1in ESCC cells. Those effects were enhanced by the Akt inhibitor LY2940002 andinverted by the Akt agonist SC79. In an in vivo evaluation of a murine xenograftmodel of esophageal cancer, combination treatment with UA and PTX suppressedtumor growth significantly better than UA or PTX treatment alone. Thus, UAeffectively potentiates the anti-tumor efficacy of PTX by targeting the Akt/FOXM1cascade since combination treatment shows significantly more anti-tumor potentialthan PTX alone both in vitro and in vivo. Combination treatment with UA and PTXcould be a new strategy for curing esophageal cancer patients.","Meng, Ruo Yu, Jin, Hua, Nguyen, Thi Van, Chai, Ok-Hee, Park, Byung-Hyun, Kim, Soo Mi",2021,International journal of molecular sciences,2

Panaxadiol, atriterpenoid saponin extracted from the roots of American ginseng, has beenproved to display anti-tumor activity in colon cancer. In this study, we foundpanaxadiol significantly inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis in humanpancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and Patu8988 in a dose-dependent manner.Furthermore, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl2,Cleaved-caspase3) was detected via western blot and immunofluorescence staining.In addition, panaxadiol was also found to inhibit the migration of pancreaticcancer cells by wound healing and transwell assays. In vivo, the growth ofxenograft pancreatic cancer models was also notably suppressed by panaxadiolcompared to the control group. Moreover, the down-regulation of JAK2-STAT3signaling pathway was responsible for the underlying pro-apoptosis mechanism ofpanaxadiol, and this result was in good agreement with molecular docking analysisbetween panaxadiol and STAT3. In conclusion, our work comprehensively exploredthe anti-tumor ability in PANC-1 and Patu8988 cells of panaxadiol and provided apotential choice for the clinical treatment of pancreatic cancer patients.","Fan, Xuhui, Fu, Haotian, Xie, Ni, Guo, Hangcheng, Fu, Tiantian, Shan, Yunfeng",2021,Aging,2

To overcome the limitation, dual functionalIG-loaded nanoparticles (DFNPs) were prepared to increase the residence time ofIG in colon. The protective mechanism of DFNPs on DSS-induced colonic injury wasevaluated in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prepared DFNPs using theoil-in-water emulsion method. PLGA was selected as sustained-release polymer, andES100 and EL30D-55 as pH-responsive polymers. The morphology and sizedistribution of NPs were measured by SEM and DLS technique. To evaluate colontargeting of DFNPs, DiR, was encapsulated as a fluorescent probe into NPs.Fluorescent distribution of NPs were investigated. The therapeutic potential andin vivo transportation of NPs in gastrointestinal tract were evaluated in acolitis model. RESULTS: SEM images and zeta data indicated the successfulpreparation of DFNPs. This formulation exhibited high loading capacity. Drugrelease results suggested DFNPs released less than 20% at the first 6 h insimulated gastric fluid (pH1.2) and simulated small intestine fluid (pH6.8). Ahigh amount of 84.7% sustained release from NPs in simulated colonic fluid(pH7.4) was beyond 24 h. DiR-loaded NPs demonstrated a much higher colonaccumulation, suggesting effective targeting due to functionalization with pH andtime-dependent polymers. DFNPs could significantly ameliorate the colonic damageby reducing DAI, macroscopic score, histological damage and cell apoptosis. Ourresults also proved that the potent anti-inflammatory effect of DFNPs iscontributed by decrease of NADPH, gene expression of COX-2 and MMP-9 and theproduction of TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23 and PGE2. CONCLUSION: We confirm that DFNPsexert protective effects through inhibiting the inflammatory response, whichcould be developed as a potential colon-targeted system.","Gao, Chenzhe, Yu, Shen, Zhang, Xiaonan, Dang, Yanxin, Han, Dan-Dan, Liu, Xin, Han, Janchun, Hui, Mizhou",2021,International journal of nanomedicine,2

Previous studies have shown these coatings to maintain theirperformance under standard operating conditions; however, when used in e.g., adental implant, these coatings may inadvertently become subject to in situcleaning treatments, such as those using an atmospheric pressure plasma jet, apromising tool for the effective in situ removal of biofilms from tissues andimplant surfaces. Here, we investigated the effect of such an exposure on theantimicrobial performance of the Melaleuca alternifolia polymer coating. It wasfound that direct exposure of the polymer coating surface to the jet for periodsless than 60 s was sufficient to induce changes in its surface chemistry andtopography, affecting its ability to retard subsequent microbial attachment. Theexact effect of the jet exposure depended on the chemistry of the polymercoating, the length of plasma treatment, cell type, and incubation conditions.The change in the antimicrobial activity for polymer coatings fabricated atpowers of 20-30 W was not statistically significant due to their limited baselinebioactivity. Interestingly, the bioactivity of polymer coatings fabricated at 10and 15 W against Staphylococcus aureus cells was temporarily improved after thetreatment, which could be attributed to the generation of loosely attachedbioactive fragments on the treated surface, resulting in an increase in the doseof the bioactive agents being eluted by the surface. Attachment and proliferationof Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells and mixed cultures were less affected by changesin the bioactivity profile of the surface. The sensitivity of the cells to thechange imparted by the jet treatment was also found to be dependent on theirorigin culture, with mature biofilm-derived P. aeruginosa bacterial cells showinga greater ability to colonize the surface when compared to its planktonicbroth-grown counterpart. The presence of plasma-generated reactive oxygen andnitrogen species in the culture media was also found to enhance the bioactivityof polymer coatings fabricated at power levels of 10 and 15 W, due to asynergistic effect arising from simultaneous exposure of cells to reactive oxygenand nitrogen species (RONS) and eluted bioactive fragments. These results suggestthat it is important to consider the possible implications of inadvertent changesin the properties and performance of plasma polymer coatings as a result ofexposure to in situ decontamination, to both prevent suboptimal performance andto exploit possible synergies that may arise for some polymer coating-surfacetreatment combinations.","Bazaka, Olha, Prasad, Karthika, Levchenko, Igor, Jacob, Mohan V, Bazaka, Kateryna, Kingshott, Peter, Crawford, Russell J, Ivanova, Elena P",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

A scar-prone constitute willaccelerate HS formation and functional disorder, which deserves systemic therapywith oral medicine. To examine the oral therapeutic effectiveness on HS withconvincing evidence of gross view and histological improvement, a rabbit ear HSmodel was employed with oral administration of asiaticoside (AS) at the doses of12 and 24 mg kg(-1)  d(-1) daily for 60 consecutive days. Gross observation andhistological findings showed that oral AS treatment could significantly inhibitHS formation in a dose dependent manner. Semi-quantification of scar elevationindex at days 7, 15, 30, and 60, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction atdays 30 and 60 also provided the evidences of reduced scar thickness andinhibited fibrotic gene expressions of collagens I, III, TGF-β1, interleukins 1β,6 and 8, and enhanced gene expression of SMAD 7 and PPAR-γ with a dose-dependentmanner. These results indicated that AS is likely to serve as a systemictherapeutic agent of HS treatment for those who may have scar-prone constitutevia anti-inflammation, inhibiting fibrotic process, and enhancing matrixdegradation.","Huang, Jia, Zhou, Xiaobo, Xia, Lingling, Liu, Weiwei, Guo, Fei, Liu, Jianhui, Liu, Wei",2021,International wound journal,2

However, it has low solubility in aqueous solutions which limitsits bioavailability and cytotoxic efficiency. In this study, nanostructured lipidcarrier loaded with eucalyptol (NLC-Eu) was formulated and characterized and thecytotoxic effect of NLC-Eu towards breast cancer cell lines was determined. Inaddition, its toxicity in animal model, BALB/c mice was also incorporated intothis study to validate the safety of NLC-Eu. METHODS: Eucalyptol, a monoterpeneoxide active, was used to formulate the NLC-Eu by using high pressurehomogenization technique. The physicochemical characterization of NLC-Eu wasperformed to assess its morphology, particle size, polydispersity index, and zetapotential. The in vitro cytotoxic effects of this encapsulated eucalyptol onhuman (MDA MB-231) and murine (4 T1) breast cancer cell lines were determinedusing the MTT assay. Additionally, acridine orange/propidium iodide assay wasconducted on the NLC-Eu treated MDA MB-231 cells. The in vivo sub-chronictoxicity of the prepared NLC-Eu was investigated using an in vivo BALB/c micemodel. RESULTS: As a result, the light, translucent, milky-colored NLC-Eu showedparticle size of 71.800 ± 2.144 nm, poly-dispersity index of 0.258 ± 0.003, andzeta potential of - 2.927 ± 0.163 mV. Furthermore, the TEM results of NLC-Eudisplayed irregular round to spherical morphology with narrow size distributionand relatively uniformed particles. The drug loading capacity and entrapmentefficiency of NLC-Eu were 4.99 and 90.93%, respectively. Furthermore, NLC-Euexhibited cytotoxic effects on both, human and mice, breast cancer cells withIC50 values of 10.00 ± 4.81 μg/mL and 17.70 ± 0.57 μg/mL, respectively at 72 h.NLC-Eu also induced apoptosis on the MDA MB-231 cells. In the sub-chronictoxicity study, all of the studied mice did not show any signs of toxicity,abnormality or mortality. Besides that, no significant changes were observed inthe body weight, internal organ index, hepatic and renal histopathology, serumbiochemistry, nitric oxide and malondialdehyde contents.

TA046116,10.1080/21505594.2021.2010398,Paeoniflorin reduce luxS/AI-2 system-controlled biofilm formation and virulencein Streptococcus suis.,"Streptococcus suis (S. suis), more specifically serotype 2, is a bacterialpathogen that threatens the lives of pigs and humans. Like many other pathogens,S. suis exhibits quorum sensing (QS) system-controlled virulence factors, such asbiofilm formation that complicates treatment. Therefore, impairing the QSinvolving LuxS/AI-2 cycle in S. suis, may be a promising alternative strategy forovercoming S. suis infections. In this study, we investigated paeoniflorin (PF),a monoterpenoid glycoside compound extracted from peony, as an inhibitor of S.suis LuxS/AI-2 system. At a sub-minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (1/16 MIC;25 μg/ml), PF significantly reduced biofilm formation by S. suis throughinhibition of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production, without affectingbacterial growth. Moreover, evidence was brought that PF reduces AI-2 activity inS. suis biofilm. Molecular docking indicated that LuxS may be the target of PF.Monitoring LuxS enzymatic activity confirmed that PF had a partial inhibitoryeffect. Finally, we showed that the use of PF in a mouse model can relieve S.suis infections. This study highlighted the anti-biofilm potential of PF againstS. suis, and brought evidence that it may as an inhibitor of the LuxS/AI-2 systemto prevent S. suis biofilm-related infections. PF can thus be used as a new typeof natural biofilm inhibitor for clinical application.","Li, Jinpeng, Fan, Qingying, Jin, Manyu, Mao, Chenlong, Zhang, Hui, Zhang, Xiaoling, Sun, Liyun, Grenier, Daniel, Yi, Li, Hou, Xiaogai, Wang, Yang",2021,Virulence,2

METHODS: A cubic liquid crystalline nanoparticle (LCNP)-basedgel was prepared as a potential topical delivery system for OA. The LCNP-basedgel was optimized using rheological, drug release kinetic, and ex vivo permeationstudies. RESULTS: The studies showed that the OA was trapped in the interior ofthe LCNP with a crystal form of Pn3m space. The optimized LCNP formulationperformed well using in vitro release studies for up to 12 h (85.49 ± 0.21%). Exvivo permeation studies showed that the LCNP-based gel formulation was superiorto a standard gel formulation. The r(2) value from the Peppas equation indicatedgood linearity, but showed irregular (non-Fickian) diffusion, suggesting thatdrug release was controlled by multiple processes. CONCLUSIONS: In this study,OA-loaded LCNPs were prepared by the precursor method, resulting in awell-characterized OA-LCNP gel preparation. The gel was shown to be effective ina rodent carrageenan-induced hind paw inflammation model with sustained efficacyafter a single application.","Shi, Zhiqi, Pan, Shugang, Wang, Luolin, Li, Sha",2021,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2
TA046128,10.3390/plants11010015,"Phytochemical Analysis, Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Properties of Thymus zygisL. and Thymus willdenowii Boiss. Essential Oils.","Essential oils (EOs) are chemical products produced by odoriferous glands from avariety of plants. These essential oils have many health benefits: antiseptic,anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. So due to these medicinalproperties, the present study was designed to analyze essential oils of Thymuszygis L. and Thymus willdenowii Boiss. for their chemical composition andbiological activities. These two thyme species were collected from the region ofIfrane, Middle Atlas of Morocco. The EO was obtained by hydrodistillation, andthe yields were 5.25% for T. zygis and 3.00% for T. willdenowii. The chemicalcomposition of the EOs was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with massspectrometry (GC-MS), and the results showed that T. zygis EO is dominated bycarvacrol (52.5%), o-cymene (23.14%), and thymol (9.68%), while the EO of T.willdenowii contains germacrene D (16.51%), carvacrol (16.19%), and geranylacetate (8.35%) as major compounds. The antioxidant activity assessed byDiphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assaysrevealed that both EOs have excellent antioxidant activities; by DPPH it resultedin IC(50) = 6.13 ± 0.11 for T. zygis and 6.78 ± 0.3 µg/mL for T. willdenowii,while the one by FRAP yielded EC(50) = 2.46 ± 0.01 (T. zygis) and 5.17 ± 0.2 (T.willdenowii) µg/mL. The antimicrobial activity of the two essential oils wasevaluated against six bacterial strains and five fungal strains by the diskdiffusion method to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), MinimumBactericidal Concentration (MBC) and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC). TheEOs revealed variable antimicrobial activities against the different testedmicrobial strains and showed strong antimicrobial activities, even againststrains known as multi-resistant to antibiotics (Acinetobacter baumannii) at lowconcentrations (2 µL/mL). T. zygis EO showed the most powerful activity againstall the studied bacteria, while that of T. willdenowii recorded moderate activitywhen tested against Shigella dysenteriae and Salmonella Typhi. With inhibitiondiameters that vary between 75 mm and 84 mm for concentrations of 2 µL/mL up to12 µL/mL, S. aureus was shown to be the most sensitive to T. zygis EO. For theantifungal activity test, T. zygis EO showed the best inhibition diameterscompared to T. willdenowii EO. These results showed that T. zygis EO has morepowerful antioxidant and antimicrobial activities than T. willdenowii EO,therefore, we deduce that thyme EOs are excellent antioxidants, they have strongantimicrobial properties, and may in the future represent new sources of naturalantiseptics that can be used in pharmaceutical and food industry.","Radi, Fatima Zahrae, Bouhrim, Mohamed, Mechchate, Hamza, Al-Zahrani, Mohammed, Qurtam, Ashraf Ahmed, Aleissa, Abdulmalik M, Drioiche, Aziz, Handaq, Nadia, Zair, Touriya",2021,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA046157,10.1186/s12916-021-02033-1,Parenteral artemisinins are associated with reduced mortality and neurologicdeficits and improved long-term behavioral outcomes in children with severemalaria.,"BACKGROUND: In 2011, the World Health Organization recommended injectableartesunate as the first-line therapy for severe malaria (SM) due to itssuperiority in reducing mortality compared to quinine. There are limited data onlong-term clinical and neurobehavioral outcomes after artemisinin use fortreatment of SM. METHODS: From 2008 to 2013, 502 Ugandan children with two commonforms of SM, cerebral malaria and severe malarial anemia, were enrolled in aprospective observational study assessing long-term neurobehavioral and cognitiveoutcomes following SM. Children were evaluated a week after hospital discharge,and 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up, and returned to hospital for any illness.In this study, we evaluated the impact of artemisinin derivatives on survival,post-discharge hospital readmission or death, and neurocognitive and behavioraloutcomes over 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: 346 children received quinine and156 received parenteral artemisinin therapy (artemether or artesunate). Afteradjustment for disease severity, artemisinin derivatives were associated with a78% reduction in in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI,0.07-0.67). Among cerebral malaria survivors, children treated with artemisininderivatives also had reduced neurologic deficits at discharge (quinine, 41.7%;artemisinin derivatives, 23.7%, p=0.007). Over a 2-year follow-up, artemisininderivatives as compared to quinine were associated with better adjusted scores(negative scores better) in internalizing behavior and executive function inchildren irrespective of the age at severe malaria episode. After adjusting formultiple comparisons, artemisinin derivatives were associated with betteradjusted scores in behavior and executive function in children <6 years of age atsevere malaria exposure following adjustment for child age, sex, socioeconomicstatus, enrichment in the home environment, and the incidence of hospitalizationsover follow-up. Children receiving artesunate had the greatest reduction inmortality and benefit in behavioral outcomes and had reduced inflammation at1-month follow-up compared to children treated with quinine. CONCLUSIONS:Treatment of severe malaria with artemisinin derivatives, particularlyartesunate, results in reduced in-hospital mortality and neurologic deficits inchildren of all ages, reduced inflammation following recovery, and betterlong-term behavioral outcomes. These findings suggest artesunate has long-termbeneficial effects in children surviving severe malaria.","Conroy, Andrea L, Opoka, Robert O, Bangirana, Paul, Namazzi, Ruth, Okullo, Allen E, Georgieff, Michael K, Cusick, Sarah, Idro, Richard, Ssenkusu, John M, John, Chandy C",2021,BMC medicine,2
TA046214,10.2147/DDDT.S322502,Triptolide is a Promising Therapeutic Approach in Treating Thyroid Cancer Basedon in silico and in vitro Experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Thyroid cancer is a familiar kind of cancer. Natural products arepromising therapeutic approaches in treating thyroid cancer. Triptolide is aditerpenoid epoxide extracted from Tripterygium wilfordii. The mechanism oftriptolide in the treatment of thyroid cancer has not been investigated clearly.METHODS: We evaluated triptolide targets and thyroid cancer targets with relateddatabases. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the triptolidetargets and thyroid cancer targets were constructed with Cytoscape software. Geneontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of thecore PPI network were obtained. Molecular docking analysis was used to evaluatedthe binding of triptolide with core targets. Furthermore, apoptosis assays,real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used toevaluate the anticancer functions of triptolide. RESULTS: Triptolide had 34targets, and thyroid cancer had 210 targets. The core PPI network of merged PPInetworks had 164 nodes and 4513 edges. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showedthat triptolide were related to the cell cycle, apoptosis, and inflammatorysignaling pathways. Molecular docking analysis showed that triptolide directlyreacted with four core targets: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A),c-JUN, RELA, and tumor protein p53 (TP53). CB-Dock analysis indicated thattriptolide could stably bind to core targets. Triptolide inhibited the growth butinduced apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells. Triptolide increased the mRNAexpression of CDKN1A and TP53 but reduced the mRNA expression of c-JUN and RELA,as shown by RT-PCR. Triptolide increased the protein levels of CDKN1A andphospho-p53 but reduced those of phospho-c-JUN and phospho-NF-κB p65, as shown byWestern blotting. DISCUSSION: We considered that triptolide could treat thyroidcancer by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis and inhibitinginflammatory pathways such as the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. CDKN1A,c-JUN, RELA, and TP53 were involved in the antithyroid cancer mechanism oftriptolide.","Wang, Fang, An, Shu-Jing, Yin, Yirong, Li, Juan-Juan, Sun, Chun-Hui, Lan, Jie, Zhao, Wen-Juan, Li, Cheng-Qian",2021,"Drug design, development and therapy",2

Humanpapillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with the occurrence of cervicalcancer. Thus, developing an effective and low-cost vaccine against HPV infection,especially in developing countries is an important issue. In this study, a novelHPV L1-E7 fusion multiepitope construct designed by immunoinformatics tools wasexpressed in bacterial system. HEK-293T cells-derived exosomes were generated andcharacterized to use as a carrier for crocin and curcumin compounds. The exosomesloaded with crocin and curcumin compounds as a chemotherapeutic agent (ExoCrocinand ExoCurcumin) were used along with the L1-E7 polypeptide for evaluation ofimmunological and anti-tumor effects in C57BL/6 mouse model. In vitro studiesshowed that ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin were not cytotoxic at a certain dose, andthey could enter tumor cells. In vivo studies indicated that combination of theL1-E7 polypeptide with ExoCrocin or ExoCurcumin could produce a significant levelof immunity directed toward Th1 response and CTL activity. These regimens showedthe protective and therapeutic effects against tumor cells (the percentage oftumor-free mice: ~100%). In addition, both ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin representedsimilar immunological and anti-tumor effects. Generally, the use of exosomalcrocin or curcumin forms along with the L1-E7 polypeptide could significantlyinduce T-cell immune responses and eradicate tumor cells.","Abbasifarid, Elnaz, Bolhassani, Azam, Irani, Shiva, Sotoodehnejadnematalahi, Fattah",2021,PloS one,2

Synthesis of nanoparticles was successfully completed byencapsulating TQ with polymeric poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) and Pluronics F68 (TQ-PLGA-PF68) using an emulsion-solventevaporation technique. The size and encapsulation efficiency of TQ-PLGA-PF68nanoparticles were 76.92 ± 27.38 nm and 94%, respectively. TQ released from theseencapsulants showed a biphasic released pattern. Cytotoxicity activity showedthat tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) MCF-7 breast cancer cells required a higherconcentration of TQ-PLGA-PF68 nanoparticles than the parental MCF-7 cells toachieve IC(50) (p < 0.05). The other two resistant subtypes (TamR UACC732inflammatory breast carcinoma and paclitaxel-resistant (PacR) MDA-MB 231triple-negative breast cell line) required a lower concentration of TQ-PLGA-PF68nanoparticles compared to their respective parental cell lines (p < 0.05). Thesefindings suggest that TQ encapsulation with PLGA-PEG and Pluronics F68 is apromising anti-cancer agent in mitigating breast cancer resistance tochemotherapeutics.

Extrahepaticangiogenesis plays an important role. Glycyrrhizin has been found to exhibitanti-angiogenic features, which leads to its extensive use. However, the relevanteffects of glycyrrhizin on liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension have not beenevaluated. This study thus aimed to investigate the impact of glycyrrhizin onportal hypertension-related derangements in cirrhotic rats. Male Sprague-Dawleyrats received bile duct ligation (BDL) to induce cirrhosis or sham operation ascontrol. The rats were subdivided to receive glycyrrhizin (150 mg/kg/day, oralgavage) or vehicle beginning on the 15th day post operation, when BDL-inducedliver fibrosis developed. The effects of glycyrrhizin were determined on the 28thday, the typical timing of BDL-induced cirrhosis. Glycyrrhizin significantlyreduced portal pressure (p = 0.004). The splanchnic inflow as measured bysuperior mesenteric arterial flow decreased by 22% (p = 0.029). Theportal-systemic collateral shunting degree reduced by 30% (p = 0.024). Themesenteric angiogenesis and phospho-VEGFR2 protein expression were alsodownregulated (p = 0.038 and 0.031, respectively). Glycyrrhizin did notsignificantly influence the liver biochemistry data. Although glycyrrhizin tendedto reverse liver fibrosis, statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.069).Consistently, hepatic inflow from portal side, hepatic vascular resistance, andliver fibrosis-related protein expressions were not affected. Glycyrrhizintreatment at the stage of hepatic fibrosis still effectively attenuated portalhypertension and portosystemic collateral shunting. These beneficial effects wereattributed to, at least in part, the suppression of mesenteric angiogenesis byVEGF signaling pathway downregulation.","Pun, Chon Kit, Huang, Hui-Chun, Chang, Ching-Chih, Chuang, Chiao-Lin, Yen, Chun-Hsien, Hsu, Shao-Jung, Lee, Fa-Yauh, Hou, Ming-Chih, Huang, Yi-Hsiang",2021,International journal of molecular sciences,2

Costunolide (CTD) possesses potentialanticancer and bioactive abilities that have been confirmed in several types ofcancers. However, its effects on oral cancer remain unclear. This studyinvestigated the potential anticancer ability and underlying mechanisms of CTD inOC in vivo and in vitro. Cell viability and anchorage-independent colonyformation assays were performed to examine the antigrowth effects of CTD on OCcells; assessments for migration and invasion of OC cells were conducted bytranswell; Cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry andverified by immunoblotting. The results revealed that CTD suppressed theproliferation, migration and invasion of oral cancer cells effectively andinduced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; regarding the mechanism, CTD bound toAKT directly by binding assay and repressed AKT activities through kinase assay,which thereby downregulating the downstream of AKT. Furthermore, CTD remarkablypromotes the generation of reactive oxygen species by flow cytometry assay,leading to cell apoptosis. Notably, CTD strongly suppresses cell-derivedxenograft OC tumor growth in an in vivo mouse model.

Here, by combining genetic, chemogenetic,pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches, we show that hypothalamicoxytocin (Oxt)-producing neurons modulate colitis-associated cancer (CAC)progression in mice. Depletion or activation of Oxt neurons could augment orsuppress CAC progression. Importantly, brain treatment with celastrol, apentacyclic triterpenoid, excites Oxt neurons and inhibits CAC progression, andthis anti-tumor effect was significantly attenuated in Oxt neuron-lesioned mice.Furthermore, brain treatment with celastrol suppresses sympathetic neuronalactivity in the celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion (CG-SMG), and activation ofβ2 adrenergic receptor abolishes the anti-tumor effect of Oxt neuron activationor centrally administered celastrol. Taken together, these findings demonstratethat hypothalamic Oxt neurons regulate CAC progression by modulating the neuronalactivity in the CG-SMG. Stimulation of Oxt neurons using chemicals, for example,celastrol, might be a novel strategy for colorectal cancer treatment.","Pan, Susu, Yin, Kaili, Tang, Zhiwei, Wang, Shuren, Chen, Zhuo, Wang, Yirong, Zhu, Hongxia, Han, Yunyun, Liu, Mei, Jiang, Man, Xu, Ningzhi, Zhang, Guo",2021,eLife,2

Therefore, natural antioxidants are hailed as promisingagents to be utilized against photoaging. In the current study, reynosin andsantamarine, two known sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Artemisia scoparia,were analyzed for their anti-photoaging properties in UVA-irradiated human dermalfibroblasts (HDFs). Results showed that UVA irradiation (8 J/cm(2)) upregulatedthe MMP-1 secretion and expression, and suppressed collagen production, whichwere significantly reverted by santamarine treatment (10 µM). Although bothreynosin and santamarine exhibited ROS scavenging abilities, reynosin failed tosignificantly diminish UVA-stimulated MMP-1 release. UVA-irradiated HDFs showedincreased collagen production when treated with santamarine. As a mechanism tosuppress MMP-1, santamarine significantly suppressed the UVA-inducedphosphorylation of p38 and JNK and nuclear translocation of p-c-Fos and p-c-Jun.Santamarine promoted collagen I production via relieving the UVA-inducedsuppression on TGF-β and its downstream activator Smad2/3 complex. Antioxidantproperties of santamarine were also shown to arise from stimulatingNrf2-dependent expression of antioxidant enzymes SOD-1 and HO-1 in UVA-irradiatedHDFs. In conclusion, santamarine was found to be a promising natural antioxidantwith anti-photoaging properties against UVA-induced damages in HDFs.","Oh, Jung Hwan, Kim, Junse, Karadeniz, Fatih, Kim, Hye Ran, Park, So Young, Seo, Youngwan, Kong, Chang-Suk",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

Resiniferatoxin was administrated intraperitoneally to induceneuropathic pain in 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats which were divided into threegroups (resiniferatoxin+recombinant hepatoma-derived growth factor antibodygroup, resiniferatoxin group, and control group) (n = 12/group). The mechanicalthreshold response was tested with calibration forceps. Cell apoptosis wasmeasured by TUNEL assay. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detectapoptosis of neuron cells and proliferation of astrocytes in the spinal corddorsal horn. RT-PCR technique and western blot were used to measure detectinflammatory factors and protein expressions. Serum hepatoma-derived growthfactor protein expression was higher in the patients with sciatica compared tocontrols. In resiniferatoxin-group rats, protein expression of hepatoma-derivedgrowth factor was higher than controls. Blocking hepatoma-derived growth factorimproved the mechanical threshold response in rats. In dorsal root ganglion,blocking hepatoma-derived growth factor inhibited inflammatory cytokines. In thespinal cord dorsal horn, blocking hepatoma-derived growth factor inhibitedproliferation of astrocyte, apoptosis of neuron cells, and attenuated expressionsof pain-associated proteins. The experiment showed that blocking hepatoma-derivedgrowth factor can prevent neuropathic pain and may be a useful alternative toconventional analgesics.","Wu, Chieh-Hsin, Wu, Ming-Kung, Lu, Chun-Ching, Tsai, Hung-Pei, Lu, Ying-Yi, Lin, Chih-Lung",2021,Neural plasticity,2

COVID-19 disease severity is correlated withheightened inflammatory responses, and HMGB1 is an important extracellularmediator in inflammation processes.In this study, we evaluated the effect ofHMGB1 inhibitor Glycyrrhizin on the cellular perturbations in lung cellsexpressing SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Pyroptosis in lung cells transfected withSARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and Orf3a, was accompanied by elevation of IL-1β andextracellular HMGB1 levels. Glycyrrhizin mitigated viral proteins-induced lungcell pyroptosis and activation of macrophages. Heightened release ofproinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8, as well as ferritin frommacrophages cultured in conditioned media from lung cells expressing SARS-CoV-2S-RBD and Orf3a was attenuated by glycyrrhizin. Importantly, Glycyrrhizininhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells without exhibiting cytotoxicityat high doses. The dual ability of Glycyrrhizin to concomitantly halt virusreplication and dampen proinflammatory mediators might constitute a viabletherapeutic option in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gowda, Pruthvi, Patrick, Shruti, Joshi, Shanker Datt, Kumawat, Rajesh Kumar, Sen, Ellora",2021,Cytokine,2

Thiswork aims at exploring the radioprotective effect of fucoxanthin (FX) onγ-radiation (RAD)-induced changes in the apelin-13/APJ pathway, which causesdamage in the liver, kidney, lung and spleen of mice. Mice were administered FX(10 mg kg-1 day-1, i.p) and exposed to γ-radiation (2.5 Gy week-1) for fourconsecutive weeks. The treatment of irradiated mice by FX resulted in asignificant amendment in protein expression of the apelin-13/APJ/NF-κB signallingpathway concurrently with reduced hypoxia (hypoxia-inducible factor-1α),suppressed oxidative stress marker (malondialdehyde), enhanced antioxidantdefence mechanisms (reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase), a modulatedinflammatory response [interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1,IL-10 and α-7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and ameliorated angiogenicregulators [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2), MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor ofmetalloproteinase-1), as well as the tissue damage indicator (lactatedehydrogenase) in organ tissues. In addition, there were significant improvementin serum inflammatory markers tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-10, IL-1β andC-reactive protein compared with irradiated mice. The histopathologicalinvestigation of the FX + RAD organ tissues support the biochemical findingswhere the improvements in the tissues' architecture were obvious when comparedwith those of RAD. FX was thus shown to have a noticeable radioprotective actionmediated through its regulatory effect on the apelin-13/APJ/NF-κB signallingpathway attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity that wasreflected in different physiological processes. It could be recommended to use FXin cases of radiation exposure to protect normal tissues.","El Bakary, Nermeen M, Thabet, Noura Magdy, El Fatih, Neama M, Abdel-Rafei, Mohamed Khairy, El Tawill, Ghada, Azab, Khaled Shaaban",2021,Journal of radiation research,2
TA046473,10.1038/s41388-021-01800-x,C/EBPβ is a MYB- and p300-cooperating pro-leukemogenic factor and promising drugtarget in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Transcription factor MYB has recently emerged as a promising drug target for thetreatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we have characterized a group ofnatural sesquiterpene lactones (STLs), previously shown to suppress MYB activity,for their potential to decrease AML cell proliferation. Unlike what was initiallythought, these compounds inhibit MYB indirectly via its cooperation partnerC/EBPβ. C/EBPβ-inhibitory STLs affect the expression of a large number ofMYB-regulated genes, suggesting that the cooperation of MYB and C/EBPβ broadlyshapes the transcriptional program of AML cells. We show that expression of GFI1,a direct MYB target gene, is controlled cooperatively by MYB, C/EBPβ, andco-activator p300, and is down-regulated by C/EBPβ-inhibitory STLs, exemplifyingthat they target the activity of composite MYB-C/EBPβ-p300 transcriptionalmodules. Ectopic expression of GFI1, a zinc-finger protein that is required forthe maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, partially abrogatedSTL-induced myelomonocytic differentiation, implicating GFI1 as a relevant targetof C/EBPβ-inhibitory STLs.

TA046629,10.1016/j.chmed.2020.04.001,bHLH transcription factor SmbHLH92 negatively regulates biosynthesis of phenolicacids and tanshinones in Salvia miltiorrhiza.,"OBJECTIVE: Salvia miltiorrhiza is a valuable herbal medicine with tanshinone andphenolic acid as the main biological active ingredients. The biosyntheticregulation of these bioactive compounds is controlled by a set of transcriptionfactors (TFs). The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor plays animportant role in various physiological and biochemical processes in plants.However, research on bHLH TFs regulating phenolic acid or tanshinone biosynthesisin S. miltiorrhiza is limited. METHODS: qRT-PCR was used for gene expressionanalysis. The subcellular localization of SmbHLH92 was detected by SmbHLH92-GFPtransient transformation into tobacco leaves, and its fluorescence was observedusing a confocal laser scanning microscope. The transcriptional activity ofSmbHLH92 was confirmed in the AH109 yeast strain. RNA interference hairy roots ofSmbHLH92-RNAi transgenic lines were obtained through Agrobacterium-mediatedgenetic transformation. Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) was usedto detect the changes of phenolic acids and tanshinones. RESULTS: SmbHLH92 is abHLH transcription factor that is highly expressed in the root and phloem of S.miltiorrhiza. The subcellular localization and transcriptional activity ofSmbHLH92 indicated that SmbHLH92 was located in the nucleus and may be atranscription factor. RNA interference (RNAi) of SmbHLH92 in hairy roots of S.miltiorrhiza significantly increased the accumulation of phenolic acid andtanshinone. Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed the transcription levelof genes encoding the key enzymes involved in the phenolic acid and tanshinonebiosynthetic pathways was increased in the hairy roots of the SmbHLH92-RNAitransgenic line, comparing with the control line. CONCLUSION: These data indicatethat SmbHLH92 is a negative regulator involved in the regulation of phenolic acidand tanshinone biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza.","Zhang, Jian-Hong, Lv, Hai-Zhou, Liu, Wan-Jing, Ji, Ai-Jia, Zhang, Xin, Song, Jing-Yuan, Luo, Hong-Mei, Chen, Shi-Lin",2020,Chinese herbal medicines,2

Jasmonates are potent inducers of artemisininaccumulation in Artemisisa annua plants. As the receptor of jasmonates, the F-boxprotein COI1 is critical to the JA signaling required for plant development,defense, and metabolic homeostasis. AaCOI1 from Artemisia annua, homologous toArabidopsis AtCOI1, encodes a F-box protein located in the nuclei. Expressionalprofiles of the AaCOI1 in the root, stem, leaves, and inflorescence wasinvestigated. The mRNA abundance of AaCOI1 was the highest in inflorescence,followed by in the leaves. Upon mechanical wounding or MeJA treatment, expressionof AaCOI1 was upregulated after 6 h. When ectopically expressed, driven by thenative promoter from Arabidopsis thaliana, AaCOI1 could partially complement theJA sensitivity and defense responses, but fully complemented the fertility, andthe JA-induced anthocyanin accumulation in a coi1-16 loss-of-function mutant. Ourstudy identifies the paralog of AtCOI1 in Artemisia annua, and revealed itsimplications in development, hormone signaling, defense, and metabolism.

TA046698,10.3390/molecules25173955,Antibacterial Activity and Mechanism of Ginger Essential Oil against Escherichiacoli and Staphylococcus aureus.,"Though essential oils exhibit antibacterial activity against food pathogens,their underlying mechanism is understudied. We extracted ginger essential oil(GEO) using supercritical CO(2) and steam distillation. A chemical compositioncomparison by GC-MS showed that the main components of the extracted GEOs werezingiberene and α-curcumene. Their antibacterial activity and associatedmechanism against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were investigated.The diameter of inhibition zone (DIZ) of GEO against S. aureus was 17.1 mm, witha minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 1.0 mg/mL, and minimum bactericideconcentration (MBC) of 2.0 mg/mL. For E. coli, the DIZ was 12.3 mm with MIC andMBC values of 2.0 mg/mL and 4.0 mg/mL, respectively. The SDS-PAGE analysisrevealed that some of the electrophoretic bacterial cell proteins bandsdisappeared with the increase in GEO concentration. Consequently, the nucleicacids content of bacterial suspension was raised significantly and the metabolicactivity of bacteria was markedly decreased. GEO could thus inhibit theexpression of some genes linked to bacterial energy metabolism, tricarboxylicacid cycle, cell membrane-related proteins, and DNA metabolism. Our findingsspeculate the bactericidal effects of GEO primarily through disruption of thebacterial cell membrane indicating its suitability in food perseveration.","Wang, Xin, Shen, Yi, Thakur, Kiran, Han, Jinzhi, Zhang, Jian-Guo, Hu, Fei, Wei, Zhao-Jun",2020,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

Thisstudy aimed to evaluate antifungal activities of Vernonia amygdalina leafextracts against B. cinerea and to screen the phytochemical compound in the crudeextract that had the highest antifungal activity. In this study, crude extractsof hexane, dichloromethane, methanol, and water extracts with concentrationlevels at 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg/mL were shown to significantly affectthe inhibition of B. cinerea. Among the crude extracts, dichloromethane extractwas shown to be the most potent in terms of antifungal activities. The SEMobservation proved that the treatment altered the fungal morphology, which leadsto fungal growth inhibition. For the in vivo bioassay, the fruits treated withdichloromethane extract at 400 and 500 mg/mL showed the lowest disease incidencewith mild severity of infection.

Borneol, one of the valuabletimehonored herbal ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine, is a populartreatment for anxiety, anesthesia, and antinociception. However, to date, littleis known as to how borneol acts on the SG neurons of the Vc. To close this gap,the whole-cell patch-clamp technique was applied to elucidate the antinociceptivemechanism responding for the actions of borneol on the SG neurons of the Vc inmice. In the voltage-clamp mode, holding at -60 mV, the borneol-inducednon-desensitizing inward currents were not affected by tetrodotoxin, avoltage-gated Na(+) channel blocker, 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione, anon-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist andDL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, an NMDA receptor antagonist. However,borneol-induced inward currents were partially decreased in the presence ofpicrotoxin, a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor antagonist, or strychnine, aglycine receptor antagonist, and was almost suppressed in the presence ofpicrotoxin and strychnine. Though borneol did not show any effect on theglycine-induced inward currents, borneol enhanced GABA-mediated responses.Beside, borneol enhanced the GABA-induced hyperpolarization under thecurrent-clamp mode. Altogether, we suggest that borneol contributes in parttoward mediating the inhibitory GABA and glycine transmission on the SG neuronsof the Vc and may serve as an herbal therapeutic for orofacial pain ailments.","Nguyen, Phuong Thao Thi, Jang, Seon Hui, Rijal, Santosh, Park, Soo Joung, Han, Seong Kyu",2020,The Korean journal of physiology & pharmacology : official journal of the KoreanPhysiological Society and the Korean Society of Pharmacology,2

In leaves, a complexcompartmentation of the MIA biosynthetic pathway occurs at both the cellular andsubcellular levels, notably for some gene products of the MEP pathway. To get acomplete overview of the pathway organization, we cloned four genes encodingmissing enzymes involved in the MEP pathway before conducting a systematicanalysis of transcript distribution and protein subcellular localization. RNA insitu hybridization revealed that all MEP pathway genes were coordinately andmainly expressed in internal phloem-associated parenchyma of young leaves,reinforcing the role of this tissue in MIA biosynthesis. At the subcellularlevel, transient cell transformation and expression of fluorescent proteinfusions showed that all MEP pathway enzymes were targeted to plastids.Surprisingly, two isoforms of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase and1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase initially exhibited anartifactual aggregated pattern of localization due to high protein accumulation.Immunogold combined with transmission electron microscopy, transienttransformations performed with a low amount of transforming DNA andfusion/deletion experiments established that both enzymes were rather diffuse instroma and stromules of plastids as also observed for the last six enzymes of thepathway.

In this scenario, the use of essentialoils (EOs) could be a valid tool against Salmonella contamination of meat. Thiswork compares the in vitro effectiveness of an Italian mixture of feed additivesbased on EOs (GR-OLI) with EO of Origanum vulgare L., recently admitted byEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for animal use. Twenty-nine Salmonellaserotypes isolated from poultry and pig farms were used to assess GR-OLI and O.vulgare EO antimicrobial propeties. O. vulgare EO was active on thedisaggregation of mature biofilm, while GR-OLI was capable of inhibiting biofilmformation and disaggregating preformed biofilm. Furthermore, GR-OLI inhibitedbacterial adhesion to Caco-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Both productsshowed inhibition of bacterial growth at all time points tested. Finally, thesynergistic action of GR-OLI with commonly used antibiotics against resistantstrains was investigated. In conclusion, the mixture could be used both to reducethe meat contamination of Salmonella spp. before slaughter, and in synergy withlow doses of ciprofloxacin against resistant strains. Although EOs as feedadditives are already used in animal husbandry, no scientific study has everhighlighted their real antimicrobial potential.","Di Vito, Maura, Cacaci, Margherita, Barbanti, Lorenzo, Martini, Cecilia, Sanguinetti, Maurizio, Benvenuti, Stefania, Tosi, Giovanni, Fiorentini, Laura, Scozzoli, Maurizio, Bugli, Francesca, Mattarelli, Paola",2020,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2

However, little information on its in vivobioavailability and biotransformation is available. To assess the bioavailabilityand metabolism of siphonaxanthin, its absorption and accumulation were evaluatedusing intestinal Caco-2 cells and Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice.Siphonaxanthin was absorbed and exhibited non-uniform accumulation anddistribution patterns in tissues of ICR mice. Notably, in addition tosiphonaxanthin, three main compounds were detected following dietaryadministration of siphonaxanthin. Because the compounds showed changes on massspectra compared with that of siphonaxanthin, they were presumed to bemetabolites of siphonaxanthin in ICR mice. Siphonaxanthin mainly accumulated instomach and small intestine, while putative metabolites of siphonaxanthin mainlyaccumulated in liver and adipose tissues. Furthermore, siphonaxanthin and itsputative metabolites selectively accumulated in white adipose tissue (WAT),especially mesenteric WAT. These results provide useful evidence regarding the invivo bioactivity of siphonaxanthin. In particular, the results regarding thespecific accumulation of siphonaxanthin and its metabolites in WAT have importantimplications for understanding their anti-obesity effects and regulatory roles inlipid metabolism.","Li, Zhuosi, Zheng, Jiawen, Luo, Xiaolin, Manabe, Yuki, Hirata, Takashi, Sugawara, Tatsuya",2020,Marine drugs,2
TA047002,10.3390/nu12103186,The Beneficial Effect of Boswellic Acid on Bone Metabolism and PossibleMechanisms of Action in Experimental Osteoporosis.,"Estrogen is instrumental in the pathological process of osteoporosis because adeficiency of this hormone increases the release of bone-resorbing cytokines.Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a constituent from Boswellia serrata, hasan anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)expression, which leads to a decline in receptor activator of nuclearfactor-kappa B (NF-κB) ligand, and consequently, a reduction in osteoclastactivity. Hence, AKBA may be beneficial against bone loss during osteoporosis.Therefore, the current study intended to evaluate the beneficial effects of AKBAin ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis and to investigate its mechanism of action.Sham-operation or ovariectomy female Sprague Dawley rats were used for evaluatingthe antiosteoporotic effect of AKBA in this study. AKBA (35 mg/kg, p.o.) andestradiol (0.05 mg/kg, i.m.) were administered for 42 days. At the end of theexperiment, body and uterus weights, serum and urine calcium and phosphorus,serum alkaline phosphatase, and urinary creatinine levels, besides serum levelsof NF-κB and TNF-α were determined. Weight, length, thickness, hardness, calciumcontent, as well as the bone mineral density of femur bone and lumbar vertebrawere measured. A histopathological examination was also carried out. AKBAameliorated all tested parameters and restored a normal histological structure.Thus, AKBA showed good antiosteoporotic activity, which may be mediated throughits suppression of the NF-κB-induced TNF-α signaling pathway.","Al-Dhubiab, Bandar E, Patel, Snehal S, Morsy, Mohamed A, Duvva, Harika, Nair, Anroop B, Deb, Pran Kishore, Shah, Jigar",2020,Nutrients,2
TA047053,10.3390/toxins12070444,Anti-Biofilm Activity of the Fungal Phytotoxin Sphaeropsidin A Against ClinicalIsolates of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria.,"Many pathogens involved in human infection have rapidly increased theirantibiotic resistance, reducing the effectiveness of therapies in recent decades.Most of them can form biofilms and effective drugs are not available to treatthese formations. Natural products could represent an efficient solution indiscovering and developing new drugs to overcome antimicrobial resistance andtreat biofilm-related infections. In this study, 20 secondary metabolitesproduced by pathogenic fungi of forest plants and belonging to diverse classes ofnaturally occurring compounds were evaluated for the first time against clinicalisolates of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.epi-Epoformin, sphaeropsidone, and sphaeropsidin A showed antimicrobial activityon all test strains. In particular, sphaeropsidin A was effective at lowconcentrations with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values ranging from6.25 μg/mL to 12.5 μg/mL against all reference and clinical test strains.Furthermore, sphaeropsidin A at sub-inhibitory concentrations decreasedmethicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, asquantified by crystal violet staining. Interestingly, mixtures of sphaeropsidin Aand epi-epoformin have shown antimicrobial synergistic effects with a concomitantreduction of cytotoxicity against human immortalized keratinocytes. Our data showthat sphaeropsidin A and epi-epoformin possess promising antimicrobialproperties.","Roscetto, Emanuela, Masi, Marco, Esposito, Matilde, Di Lecce, Roberta, Delicato, Antonella, Maddau, Lucia, Calabrò, Viola, Evidente, Antonio, Catania, Maria Rosaria",2020,Toxins,2
TA047085,10.1002/ana.25864,Non-Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease are Reduced by Nabilone.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety ofnabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol analogue, as a treatment for non-motorsymptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: This was a phase IIplacebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, enriched enrollment randomizedwithdrawal trial conducted at the Medical University Innsbruck. A random sampleof 47 patients with PD with stable motor disease and disturbing NMS defined by ascore of ≥4 points on the Movement Disorder Society - Unified PD Rating Scale-I(MDS-UPDRS-I) underwent open-label nabilone titration (0.25 mg once daily to 1 mgtwice daily, phase I). Responders were randomized 1:1 to continue with nabiloneor switch to placebo for 4 weeks (phase II). The primary efficacy criterion wasthe change of the MDS-UPDRS-I between randomization and week 4. Safety wasanalyzed in all patients who received at least one nabilone dose. RESULTS:Between October 2017 and July 2019, 19 patients received either nabilone (mediandose = 0.75 mg) or placebo. At week 4, mean change of the MDS-UPDRS-I was 2.63(95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 3.74, p = 0.002, effect size = 1.15) in theplacebo versus 1.00 (95% CI -0.16 to 2.16, p = 0.280, effect size = 0.42) in thenabilone-group (difference: 1.63, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.18, p = 0.030, effect size =0.66). Seventy-seven percent of patients had adverse events (AEs) duringopen-label titration, most of them were transient. In the double-blind phase,similar proportions of patients in each group had AEs (42% in the placebo groupand 32% in the nabilone group). There were no serious AEs. INTERPRETATION: Ourresults highlight the potential efficacy of nabilone for patients with PD withdisturbing NMS, which appears to be driven by positive effects on anxious moodand night-time sleep problems.

TA047130,10.3892/etm.2020.8893,25-OH-PPD inhibits hypertrophy on diabetic cardiomyopathy via the PI3k/Akt/GSK-3βsignaling pathway.,"The present study investigated the inhibitory effects and the associatedmechanism of the compound 25-OH-PPD (PPD) on cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis andinflammation. The signaling pathways associated with diabetic mellituscardiomyopathy (DMCM) were investigated using a rat model. DMCM Sprague-Dawleyrats were induced by injection of streptozotocin. The animals were divided into 5groups as follows: Normal group (NG group), diabetic group, PPD treatment group,PPD/LY294002 group (inhibitor of PI3K/Akt) and PPD/LiCl group [inhibitor ofglycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β]. The studies were carried out during the 12weeks following induction of diabetes and the levels of plasma brain natriureticpeptide (BNP), creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) were measured. Inaddition, the volume of myocardial collagen fraction (CVF) was tested. Theexpression levels of the inflammatory cytokines, including transforming growthfactor beta 1 (TGF-β1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), cell adhesionmolecules α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)and associated signaling proteins (Akt, GSK-3β) were measured by biochemicalanalyses. The levels of BNP and CK-MB, the volume of CVF, the expression levelsof TGF-β1, CTGF, α-SMA and VCAM-1 in the diabetic group were higher compared withthose of the normal control group (P<0.05). Conversely, the levels of thesemolecules were significantly decreased in the PPD treatment groups (P<0.05). Theaforementioned effects were partially eliminated in the PPD/LY294002 and PPD/LiClgroups. In addition, PPD treatment significantly increased the expression levelsof p-Akt and decreased the levels of phosphorylated GSK-3β compared with those ofthe DMCM group (P<0.05). The data demonstrated that the protective effects of25-OH-PPD against DMCM may be attributed to the PI3k/Akt/GSK-3β signalingpathway, via the suppression of the α-SMA/VCAM axis and the downregulation ofTGF-β1 and CTGF expression.","Liu, Xinyu, Song, Feiran, Liu, Chunna, Zhang, Yi",2020,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2
TA047152,10.1155/2020/5390482,Tanshinone IIA Protects against Acute Pancreatitis in Mice by InhibitingOxidative Stress via the Nrf2/ROS Pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) and its main active componentTanshinone IIA (TSA) are clinically used in China. However, the effects of TSA onacute pancreatitis (AP) and its potential mechanism have not been investigated.In this study, our objective was to investigate the protective effects of TSAagainst AP via three classic mouse models. METHODS: Mouse models of AP wereestablished by caerulein, sodium taurocholate, and L-arginine, separately.Pancreatic and pulmonary histopathological characteristics and serum amylase andlipase levels were evaluated, and changes in oxidative stress injury and theultrastructure of acinar cells were observed. The reactive oxygen species (ROS)inhibitor N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2) knockout mice were applied to clarify the protective mechanism of thedrug. RESULTS: In the caerulein-induced AP model, TSA administration reducedserum amylase and lipase levels and ameliorated the histopathologicalmanifestations of AP in pancreatic tissue. Additionally, TSA appreciablydecreased ROS release, protected the structures of mitochondria and theendoplasmic reticulum, and increased the protein expression of Nrf2 and hemeoxygenase 1 of pancreatic tissue. In addition, the protective effects of TSAagainst AP were counteracted by blocking the oxidative stress (NAC administrationand Nrf2 knockout in mice). Furthermore, we found that TSA protects pancreatictissue from damage and pancreatitis-associated lung injury in two additionalmouse models induced by sodium taurocholate and by L-arginine. CONCLUSION: Ourdata confirmed the protective effects of TSA against AP in mice by inhibitingoxidative stress via the Nrf2/ROS pathway.","Chen, Weiwei, Yuan, Chenchen, Lu, Yingying, Zhu, Qingtian, Ma, Xiaojie, Xiao, Weiming, Gong, Weijuan, Huang, Wei, Xia, Qing, Lu, Guotao, Li, Weiqin",2020,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2
TA047159,10.1155/2020/3101324,Antifungal Activity of the Essential Oil of Echinops kebericho Mesfin: An InVitro Study.,"BACKGROUND: Echinops kebericho is an endemic medicinal plant in Ethiopia widelyused in the treatment of infectious and noninfectious diseases. Essential oilsare known for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, andantioxidant properties. This study evaluated the antifungal activity of essentialoil from E. kebericho against four common pathogenic fungi and two standardstrains. METHODS: The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. Theantifungal screening was done by agar well diffusion method. Minimal inhibitoryconcentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution. Minimal fungicidalconcentrations (MFCs) were determined by subculturing fungal strains with novisible growth onto a Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plate. RESULTS: Candidaalbicans and Cryptococcus neoformans were highly sensitive while Aspergillusflavus did not show sensitivity up to 1 mg/ml of essential oil; MICs ranged from0.083 mg/ml to 0.208 mg/ml. Concentration and fungal species showed significantdose-dependent associations (p < 0.0001) with antifungal activity. The MICs ofessential oil were comparable to those of the standard drug (fluconazole) againstC. glabrata and C. krusei. The lowest MFC of the essential oil was observedagainst Candida parapsilosis (0.145 mg/ml) while the highest MFC was againstCandida krusei (0.667 mg/ml). CONCLUSION: Echinops kebericho essential oil showednoteworthy antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans,and Candida glabrata and could be a potential candidate for further antifungaldrug development.","Beressa, Tamirat Bekele, Deyno, Serawit, Alele, Paul E",2020,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2

Thepresent study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adding TGs toangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers(ARBs). METHODS: By searching Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, SINOMED, ChinaNational Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Information/Chinese Scientific Journals,and WANFANG databases, we identified previous studies that met the specificselection criteria and included them in the meta-analysis. Analyses wereperformed using Review Manager (version 5.3). RESULTS: Nine randomized controlledtrials were included in the final meta-analysis. Patients were compared beforeand after treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs plus TGs, or ACE inhibitors orARBs alone. The results revealed that treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs plusTGs resulted in significantly greater reductions in 24-h urinary total protein(UTP) levels (trial duration <2 months, mean difference [MD]: -0.25; 95%confidence interval [CI]: -0.32, -0.18; trial duration between 2 and 6 months,MD: -0.39; 95% CI: -0.44, -0.33; trial duration >6 months, MD: -2.09; 95% CI:-2.89, -1.29) compared with treatment using ACE inhibitors or ARBs alone.Additionally, ACE inhibitors or ARBs plus TGs showed better results afterlong-term administration. Treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs plus TGs resultedin significantly greater reductions in serum creatinine (SCr) compared with ACEinhibitors or ARBs alone (MD: -9.87; 95% CI: -13.76, -5.97). CONCLUSION: Inpatients with DN, adding TGs to ACE inhibitors or ARBs significantly lowered boththe 24-h UTP and SCr levels. Therefore, ACE inhibitors or ARBs plus TGs mightimprove the treatment of DN in patients.","Fang, Jin-Ying, Yang, Yue, Zhang, Zheng, Jiang, Shi-Min, Yu, Tian-Yu, Li, Wen-Ge",2020,Chronic diseases and translational medicine,2
TA047164,10.1155/2020/4046256,Role of Muscarinic Receptors in Hypoalgesia Induced by Crocin in Neuropathic PainRats.,"OBJECTIVE: Crocin as an important constituent of saffron has antineuropathic painproperties; however, the exact mechanism of this effect is not known. The aim ofthis study was whether the hypoalgesic effect of crocin can be exerted throughmuscarinic receptors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present project, 36 maleWistar rats (200 ± 20 g) were used. Animals randomly divided into six groups(sham, neuropathy, neuropathy + crocin, neuropathy + atropine 0.5 mg/kg,neuropathy + atropine 1 mg/kg, and neuropathy + atropine 1 mg/kg + crocin).Neuropathy was induced by the chronic constriction injury (CCI) method on thesciatic nerve. Crocin and atropine was administered intraperitoneally during 14days following the 14(th) day after surgery. Pain response was detected everythree days, two hours after each injection and 3 days following last injection.Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were detected using the Von Freyfilaments and plantar test device, respectively. RESULTS: CCI significantlyreduced the paw withdrawal response to mechanical and thermal stimulus (P < 0.01and P < 0.05, respectively). Crocin therapy significantly reduced mechanicalallodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by CCI (P < 0.05). Atropinepretreatment significantly blocked the hypoalgesic effect of crocin (P < 0.05 inmechanical allodynia and P < 0.01 in thermal hyperalgesia). Fourteen daysadministration of atropine alone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg but not 1 mg/kgsignificantly reduced CCI-induced mechanical allodynia at day 30 after surgery.CONCLUSION: Crocin significantly decreased CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Thehypoalgesic effect of crocin was blocked by atropine pretreatment, whichindicates an important role for muscarinic receptors in the effect of crocin.","Safakhah, Hossein Ali, Vafaei, Abbas Ali, Tavasoli, Azin, Jafari, Simin, Ghanbari, Ali",2020,TheScientificWorldJournal,2

Treatment ofheart embryonic H9c2 cells with JC105 (10 μM) significantly increased survival ofcells exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation. JC105 (10 μM) activated ERK1/2, DRP1 andincreased levels of cardioprotective SUR2A in hypoxia-reoxygenation, but did nothave any effects on ERK1/2, DRP1 and/or SUR2A in normoxia. U0126 (10 μM)inhibited JC105-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and DRP1 without affecting AKTor AMPK, which were also not regulated by JC105. Seahorse bioenergetic analysisdemonstrated that JC105 (10 μM) did not affect mitochondria at rest, but itcounteracted all mitochondrial effects of hypoxia-reoxygenation. Cytoprotectionafforded by JC105 was inhibited by U0126 (10 μM). Taken all together, thesedemonstrate that (a) JC105 protects H9c2 cells against hypoxia-reoxygenation andthat (b) this effect is mediated via ERK1/2. The unique property of JC105 is thatselectively activates ERK1/2 in cells exposed to stress, but not in cells undernon-stress conditions.","Mohammed Abdul, Khaja Shameem, Rayadurgam, Jayachandra, Faiz, Neha, Jovanović, Aleksandar, Tan, Wen",2020,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2

Doxycyclineand rifampicin were previously shown to deplete Wolbachia endosymbionts leadingto a permanent sterilization of the female adult filariae and adult worm death inhuman clinical studies. Twice-daily oral treatment of Litomosoidessigmodontis-infected mice with 200 mg/kg AN11251 for 10 days achieved a Wolbachiadepletion > 99.9% in the adult worms, exceeding the Wolbachia reduction by 10-daytreatments with bioequivalent human doses of doxycycline and a similar reductionas high-dose rifampicin (35 mg/kg). Wolbachia reductions of > 99% were alsoaccomplished by 14 days of oral AN11251 at a lower twice-daily dose (50 mg/kg) oronce-per-day 200 mg/kg AN11251 treatments. The combinations tested of AN11251with doxycycline had no clear beneficial impact on Wolbachia depletion, achievinga > 97% Wolbachia reduction with 7 days of treatment. These results indicate thatAN11251 is superior to doxycycline and comparable to high-dose rifampicin in theL. sigmodontis mouse model, allowing treatment regimens as short as 10-14 days.Therefore, AN11251 represents a promising pre-clinical candidate that wasidentified in the L. sigmodontis model, and could be further evaluated anddeveloped as potential clinical candidate for human lymphatic filariasis andonchocerciasis.","Ehrens, Alexandra, Lunde, Christopher S, Jacobs, Robert T, Struever, Dominique, Koschel, Marianne, Frohberger, Stefan J, Lenz, Franziska, Fendler, Martina, Turner, Joseph D, Ward, Stephen A, Taylor, Mark J, Freund, Yvonne R, Stefanakis, Rianna, Easom, Eric, Li, Xianfeng, Plattner, Jacob J, Hoerauf, Achim, Hübner, Marc P",2020,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect on the larvicidalaction when artificially varying the chemical composition of orange oil (Citrussinensis L.). As results, we found that the analysis of gas chromatographycoupled to mass spectrometry showed the presence of terpenoid and sesquiterpenoidcompounds in the different samples. The use of electric pulses on samplesmodified their chemical composition, so that the percentage of limonene went from72% in the sample that was not subjected to electric treatment to lowerpercentages, even in sample three the percentage of limonene was <50%. Only threecompounds (limonene, linalool and caryophyllene) were found to be common in allsamples. Subsequently, the larvicidal action on Drosophila melanogaster larvaewas evaluated. Six concentrations of each oil sample were tested (0, 100, 500,1000, 5000 and 10000 ppm). We found that there was no linear relationship betweenconcentration and lethality. Additionally, in the sample without electricaltreatment most of the concentrations tested had lethality higher than 50%, whilein sample 7 the results of the lethality were lower than 30%, so that biologicaltests showed that in samples where the concentration of limonene was lower, thelethality in the larvae decreased.","Anaya-Gil, Jorge, Cabarcas-Caro, Adriana, Leyva-Ricardo, Miguel, Parra-Garrido, José, Gaitan-Ibarra, Ricardo, Vivas-Reyes, Ricardo",2021,Saudi journal of biological sciences,2

The present research assessed the antagonistic effects andmechanisms of Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) on aging of HSCs/HPCs. MATERIAL AND METHODSFifty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated and divided into the followinggroups: Control (n=10), Model (n=10, treated with D-galactose, as aging model),Rg1 Control (n=10), Rg1 treatment (n=10), and Rg1 prevention (n=10). An aging ratmodel was established by subcutaneous injection with D-gal. HSC/HPC cells werestained using SA-ß-Gal staining. HSC/HPC cells were examined using flow cytometryassay. CFU-mix assay, with a few modifications, was performed. Cleaved caspase-3,B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were examinedusing qRT-PCR. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) expression wasdetermined using Western blot assay and qRT-PCR. RESULTS Rg1 (treatment andprevention group) significantly decreased SA-ß-Gal-positive staining in Sca-1⁺HSC/HPC cells compared to that of the D-gal model (p<0.05). Rg1 significantlyenhanced formation capacity of CFU-Mix compared to the D-gal model (p<0.05) inSca-1⁺ HSC/HPC cells. Rg1 significantly reduced G0/G1 phase of Sca-1⁺ HSC/HPCcells compared to that of the D-gal model (p<0.05).

In this study, we explored the protective effectsand mechanism of AsC on macrophage polarization in atherosclerosis in vivo and invitro. Using a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE-/- mouse model and RAW264.7macrophages exposed to ox-LDL, AsC was evaluated for its effects on polarizationand autophagy. AsC significantly reduced the plaque area in atherosclerotic miceand lipid accumulation in ox-LDL-treated macrophages, promoted M2 phenotypemacrophage polarization, increased the number of autophagosomes and modulated theexpression of autophagy-related proteins. Moreover, the autophagy inhibitor3-methyladenine and BECN1 siRNA obviously abolished the antiatherosclerotic andM2 macrophage polarization effects of AsC. Mechanistically, AsC targeted Sirt1andincreased its expression, and this increase in expression was associated withincreased autophagy and M2 phenotype polarization. In contrast, the effects ofAsC were markedly blocked by EX527 and Sirt1 siRNA. Altogether, AsC attenuatesfoam cell formation and lessens atherosclerosis by modulating macrophagepolarization via Sirt1-mediated autophagy.","Luo, Yun, Lu, Shan, Gao, Ye, Yang, Ke, Wu, Daoshun, Xu, Xudong, Sun, Guibo, Sun, Xiaobo",2020,Aging,2

Theaim of this study was to evaluate oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) and thyme (Thymusvulgaris L.) aqueous and ethanol extracts usability to improve the hygienicquality of perennial ryegrass, red clover and blue alfalfa silage samples andestimate their effect to mycotoxins concentrations. During the experiment underlaboratory conditions 63 silage samples (21 perennial ryegrasses, 21 bluealfalfa, 21 red clover) has been fermented with inserted oregano and thymeaqueous and ethanol extracts and two commercial inoculants with mesophilic lacticacid bacteria. After 96 days of fermentation in silage samples were establishedfermentation parameters, microbiological status and mycotoxins concentrations. Itwas determined that the best results for perennial ryegrass and red clover silagesamples hygienic quality was achieved with inserted oregano aqueous and thymeethanol extracts. While in blue alfalfa samples, the best results of silagehygienic indicators were determined with inserted oregano aqueous and ethanolextracts. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and T-2toxin concentrations in perennial ryegrass, red clover and blue alfalfa silagesamples were best reduced with inserted aqueous and ethanol extracts of oreganoand thyme. The present study shows that oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) and thyme(Thymus vulgaris L.) aqueous and ethanol extracts can be used to improve thesilage hygienic quality, reduce mycotoxins concentrations and thus ensure thewellness of cattle.","Vaičiulienė, Gintarė, Bakutis, Bronius, Jovaišienė, Jurgita, Falkauskas, Rimvydas, Gerulis, Gediminas, Baliukonienė, Violeta",2020,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2

Endophytic fungi have beenproposed as a prominent alternative source for Taxol and its intermediateBaccatin III, however the very low yields remain a hinderance to their commercialutilization. Significant research efforts towards this end are underway globally.Here, we report the results on our earlier reported Taxol-producing endophyticfungus, Fusarium solani from the standpoint of spores as seed inoculum and mediaselection for enhanced Taxol and baccatin III yields. Spores produced on M1Dmedium with 94.76% viability were used for further media optimization for Taxoland Baccatin III production in five different liquid media under static andshaker condition at different cultivation days. Taxol and Baccatin III whenquantified through competitive inhibition enzyme immunoassay (CIEIA), showedmaximum production at 136.3 µg L(-1) and 128.3 µg L(-1), respectively in themodified flask basal broth (MFBB) under shaking condition. Further, two importantgenes of this pathway, namely taxane 13α-hydroxylase (T13αH) and10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-β-O-acetyltransferase (DBAT) have been identified inthis fungus. These findings are hoped to assist in further manipulation andmetabolic engineering of the parent F. solani strain towards the enhancedproduction of Taxol and baccatin III.","Chakravarthi, Balabhadrapatruni V S K, Singh, Satpal, Kamalraj, Subban, Gupta, Vijai Kumar, Jayabaskaran, Chelliah",2020,Scientific reports,2

TA047369,10.1038/s41598-020-79019-1,Hemistepsin A suppresses colorectal cancer growth through inhibiting pyruvatedehydrogenase kinase activity.,"Most cancer cells primarily produce their energy through a high rate ofglycolysis followed by lactic acid fermentation even in the presence of abundantoxygen. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 1, an enzyme responsible for aerobicglycolysis via phosphorylating and inactivating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)complex, is commonly overexpressed in tumors and recognized as a therapeutictarget in colorectal cancer. Hemistepsin A (HsA) is a sesquiterpene lactoneisolated from Hemistepta lyrata Bunge (Compositae). Here, we report that HsA is aPDK1 inhibitor can reduce the growth of colorectal cancer and consequentactivation of mitochondrial ROS-dependent apoptotic pathway both in vivo and invitro. Computational simulation and biochemical assays showed that HsA directlybinds to the lipoamide-binding site of PDK1, and subsequently inhibits theinteraction of PDK1 with the E2 subunit of PDH complex. As a result of PDK1inhibition, lactate production was decreased, but oxygen consumption wasincreased. Mitochondrial ROS levels and mitochondrial damage were also increased.Consistent with these observations, the apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells waspromoted by HsA with enhanced activation of caspase-3 and -9. These resultssuggested that HsA might be a potential candidate for developing a novelanti-cancer drug through suppressing cancer metabolism.","Jin, Ling, Kim, Eun-Yeong, Chung, Tae-Wook, Han, Chang Woo, Park, So Young, Han, Jung Ho, Bae, Sung-Jin, Lee, Jong Rok, Kim, Young Woo, Jang, Se Bok, Ha, Ki-Tae",2020,Scientific reports,2

Carvacrol is reported to be lethally toxic to C. albicans, involvingseveral potential mechanisms. However, the form and specific mechanism of celldeath caused by this compound has not been delineated. In this study, we foundthat carvacrol could significantly decrease C. albicans survival rates,consistent with previous researches. Further examination proved that carvacroltreatment caused cell membrane permeability and depolarization. To elucidate theassociation between cell death and apoptosis, DNA fragmentation and metacaspaseactivation were determined; as expected, these two apoptosis-related markers wereclearly observed. Moreover, total and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)levels were elevated, and both mitochondrial transmembrane potential andmorphology were disrupted. Additionally, cytosolic and mitochondrial calciumlevels were also increased by carvacrol. Calcineurin inhibition experimentsrevealed cyclosporine A (CsA) addition notably rescued cell growth and inhibitedmetacaspase activation, indicating that carvacrol triggered C. albicans apoptosisthrough inducing calcineurin activation. Carvacrol was demonstrated to both havelow toxicity and be effective in alleviating systemic infections with C.albicans, which might be via its antifungal and immunomodulation activities. Thisstudy suggests that carvacrol has excellent potential as a natural protectivecompound against C. albicans infections.","Niu, Chao, Wang, Chenglu, Yang, Yijia, Chen, Ruiyao, Zhang, Jian, Chen, Haiyan, Zhuge, Yingzhi, Li, Jingqi, Cheng, Jianhua, Xu, Ke, Chu, Maoping, Ren, Chunhua, Zhang, Chunxiang, Jia, Chang",2020,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2

The interaction betweenNOX4/ROS and RhoA/ROCK1 in liver fibrosis is not yet clear. Ursolic acid (UA) isa traditional Chinese medicine with anti-fibrotic effects, but the molecularmechanism underlying these effects is still unclear. We investigated theinteraction between NOX4/ROS and RhoA/ROCK1 during liver fibrosis and whetherthese molecules are targets for the anti-fibrotic effects of UA. First, weconfirmed that UA reversed CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. In the NOX4 interventionand RhoA intervention groups, related experimental analyses confirmed thedecrease in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Next, we determined that the expressionof NOX4 and RhoA/ROCK1 was decreased in UA-treated liver fibrotic mice.Furthermore, RhoA/ROCK1 expression was decreased in the NOX4 intervention group,but there was no significant change in the expression of NOX4 in the RhoAintervention group. Finally, we found that liver fibrotic mice showed a declinein their microbiota diversity and abundance, a change in their microbiotacomposition, and a reduction in the number of potential beneficial bacteria.However, in UA-treated liver fibrotic mice, the microbiota dysbiosis wasameliorated. In conclusion, the NOX4/ROS and RhoA/ROCK1 signalling pathways areclosely linked to the development of liver fibrosis. UA can reverse liverfibrosis by inhibiting the NOX4/ROS and RhoA/ROCK1 signalling pathways, which mayinteract with each other.","Wan, Sizhe, Luo, Fangyun, Huang, Chenkai, Liu, Cong, Luo, Qingtian, Zhu, Xuan",2020,Aging,2

Thepresent research aimed to validate the STM's impacts on the proliferation,migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, and to study itspotential mechanism. Two HCC cell lines were treated with STM. Tumour growth wasobserved by the mouse tumour xenografts model. HCC cell lines stably expressingT-cell lymphomas 1 (FRAT1) were generated by lentivirusmediated overexpression.Cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion were observed using CellCounting Kit-8 (CCK8), the xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analyzer system (RTCA), andtranswell analysis, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chainreaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to observe the expression ofFRAT1 and proteins related to the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Tumour growthwas inhibited by STM in vivo. STM suppressed the proliferation, migration, andinvasion of HCC cells. STM negatively regulated FRAT1 expression, whereasoverexpressed FRAT1 blocked the anti-tumour function of STM. The results revealedthat STM suppressed the FRAT1/Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.

TA047450,10.1093/jxb/erz492,Enhanced accumulation of gibberellins rendered rice seedlings sensitive toammonium toxicity.,"Ammonium (NH4+) phytotoxicity is a worldwide phenomenon, but the primary toxicmechanisms are still controversial. In the present study, we investigated thephysiological function of gibberellins (GAs) in the response of rice plants toNH4+ toxicity and polyamine accumulation using GA biosynthesis-related ricemutants. Exposure to NH4+ significantly decreased GA4 production in shoots ofwild-type (WT) plants. Both exogenous GA application to the WT and increases inendogenous GA levels in eui1 mutants rendered them more sensitive to NH4+toxicity. In contrast, growth of sd1 GA-deficient mutants was more tolerant toNH4+ toxicity than that of their WT counterparts. The role of polyamines inGA-mediated NH4+ toxicity was evaluated using WT rice plants and their GA-relatedmutants. The eui1 mutants with GA overproduction displayed a higher endogenousputrescine (Put) accumulation than WT plants, leading to an enhancedPut/[spermidine (Spd)+spermine (Spm)] ratio in their shoots. In contrast,mutation of the SD1 gene encoding a defective enzyme in GA biosynthesis resultedin a significant increase in Spd and Spm production, and reduction in thePut/(Spd+Spm) ratio when exposed to a high NH4+ medium. Exogenous application ofPut exacerbated symptoms associated with NH4+ toxicity in rice shoots, while thesymptoms were alleviated by an inhibitor of Put biosynthesis. These findingshighlight the involvement of GAs in NH4+ toxicity, and that GA-induced Putaccumulation is responsible for the increased sensitivity to NH4+ toxicity inrice plants.","Wang, Baolan, Wei, Haifang, Zhang, Hui, Zhang, Wen-Hao",2020,Journal of experimental botany,2

It is characterized by permanent or transient cerebralischemia and it activates syndrome of pathological events such as membranedepolarization, glutamate excitotoxicity, and intracellular calcium buildup.Carveol is widely employed as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant in traditionalChinese medicine. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects ofpost-treated carveol were demonstrated against transient middle cerebral arteryocclusion (MCAO) induced focal ischemic cerebral injury. Male Sprague Dawley (SD)rats were subjected to two different experimental protocols to determine the doseand effects of carveol, and to demonstrate the underlying role of the nuclearfactor E2-related factor (Nrf2) pathway. Our results showed that MCAO inducedmarked neuronal injury in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum associated withhigher inflammatory cytokines expression, along with apoptotic markers such ascaspase-3 and the phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Furthermore, MCAOinduced a marked increase in oxidative stress as evidenced by high lipidperoxidase (LPO) content accompanied by the depressed antioxidant system. Carveolsignificantly reversed the oxidative stress and downregulated inflammatorycascades by enhancing endogenous antioxidant mechanisms including the Nrf2 gene,which critically regulates the expression of several downstream antioxidants.Further, to determine the possible involvement of Nrf2 in carveol mediatedneuroprotection, we antagonized Nrf2 by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and suchtreatment abrogated the protective effects of carveol accompanied withexaggerated neuronal toxicity as demonstrated by higher infarction area. Thetarget effects of carveol were further supported by molecular docking analysis ofdrug-protein interactions. Together, our findings suggest that carveol couldactivate endogenous master anti-oxidant Nrf2, which further regulates theexpression of downstream antioxidants, eventually ameliorating MCAO-inducedneuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.","Malik, Imran, Shah, Fawad Ali, Ali, Tahir, Tan, Zhen, Alattar, Abdullah, Ullah, Najeeb, Khan, Arif-Ullah, Alshaman, Reem, Li, Shupeng",2020,Frontiers in neuroscience,2

Recent studies have reported that the pituitary adenylatecyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) signaling pathway is involved in theprogression of depression. In the present study, we extracted crocin from thetraditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, to evaluate itsantidepressant effect and clarify the underlying mechanism. Here, we establisheda chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model to assess whether crocincan improve depression-like behavior in an open field test (OFT), tail suspensiontest (TST), forced swimming test (FST), and sucrose preference test (SPT). Acorticosterone (CORT) model of PC12 was set up to explore the antidepressantmechanism of crocin. We pretreated PC12 cells with crocin for 1 hour and thenstimulated the cells with CORT for 24 hours. Cell survival was detected byHoechst staining and MTT assay. The expression of PACAP, cyclic adenosinemonophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB), and extracellularregulated protein kinases (ERK) were analyzed by western blotting. PACAP RNAi wasused to interfere with PC12 cells to downregulate the content of PACAP. Theresults showed that crocin (30 mg/kg) significantly reversed the decrease of bodyweight and elevation of serum CORT, mitigated CUMS induced depression-likebehaviors of mice, and crocin (12.5 μmol/L) protected PC12 cells against CORT(200 μmol/L)-induced injury. Furthermore, crocin greatly increased the proteinexpression of PACAP and phosphorylation of ERK and CREB in the CORT model. PACAPRNAi cancelled the neuroprotective effect of crocin.

We hypothesized thatthe anti-Helicobacter pylori properties of phytoncide, which is extracted frompinecone waste, would facilitate use as a natural gastroprotective product totreat gastrointestinal tract disorders. Thus, we investigated in vitroantibacterial efficacy against H. pylori by agar diffusion assay. To determinethe gastroprotective properties of phytoncide, we conducted hematoxylin and eosinstaining, performed assays for the detection of the cytotoxin gene, and evaluatedpro-inflammatory cytokine expression in H. pylori-infected C57BL/6 mice.Phytoncide significantly inhibited the survival of H. pylori in thegastrointestinal system of C57BL/6 mice. Reduction of gastric severity in H.pylori-infected mice was associated with reductions in the expression levels ofpro-inflammatory cytokines in the gastric mucosa, and of the cytotoxin CagA genein phytoncide treated groups (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). In conclusion, phytoncidesignificantly inhibited the growth of H. pylori in gastro tissue, possibly due tothe abundant α-pinene present in the phytoncide as detected by HPLC analysis.Further studies are needed to validate our findings, but we suggest thatphytoncide has the potential to be used as a natural ingredient in anti-H. pyloriproducts.","Kim, Se-Eun, Memon, Azra, Kim, Bae Yong, Jeon, Hyelin, Lee, Woon Kyu, Kang, Se Chan",2020,Scientific reports,2

Theantioxidant activity was determined by using different free radicals [i.e.,1,1-diphenyl,2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH),2,2-azinobis[3-ethylbenzthiazoline]-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), and hydrogen peroxide(H(2)O(2))]. Moreover, different phytoconstituents were identified in the mostactive solvent fraction by GC-MS analysis. Furthermore, comparative fingerprintsof methanolic extract and chloroform fraction were also analyzed via HighPerformance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Diode Array Detector (HPLC-DAD).The crude methanolic extract of E. caeruleum (Ec.Cr) and its sub-fractions [i.e.,n-hexane (Ec.Hex), chloroform (Ec.Chf), ethyl acetate (Ec.EtAc), and aqueous(Ec.Aq) were employed in this study]. In the α-glucosidase inhibition assay, aconcentration-dependent inhibitory response was observed against the enzyme. Themost active sample was Ec.Chf which revealed an IC(50) of 437 μg/ml in comparisonto the standard acarbose (IC(50) 25 μg/ml). The rest of the samples showedmoderate inhibition of α-glucosidase. In antioxidant assays, Ec.Chf and Ec.Crexhibited a considerable scavenging effect against all the free radicals. TheIC(50) values recorded for Ec.Chf were 112, 109, and 150 μg/ml against DPPH,ABTS, and H(2)O(2) respectively. Based on the in-vitro potential of Ec.Chf, thiswas subjected to the in-vivo model experiment. The Ec.Chf lowered the bloodglucose level up to 10.3 mmol/L at 500 μg/Kg. The Ec.Chf was also subjected toGC-MS analysis. The GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of 60 compounds.

However, its protective effects against renalischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury have not been elucidated. In male Wistar rats,we induced I/R under general anesthesia by occluding the renal artery for 60 min,followed by reperfusion and right nephrectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Rats wererandomized to 4 groups: a sham group, an I/R group, an NR-pretreated (50 mg/kg)before I/R induction group, and an NR control group. All animals were killed at72 h after I/R induction. Blood and renal tissues were collected, andhistological and basic renal function parameters were assessed. In addition,levels of various kidney markers and proinflammatory cytokines were measuredusing RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULTS After I/Rinduction, the onset of renal dysfunction was shown by the elevated levels ofserum urea, creatinine levels, and histological evaluation, showing a 2-foldincrease in the renal failure markers kim-1 and NGAL compared to control rats.Rats pretreated with NR before I/R induction had significantly better renalfunctions, with attenuated levels of oxidative markers, restored levels ofinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), tumorgrowth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1), INF-γ, and IL-6, and increased anti-inflammatorycytokine levels (IL-10) compared to I/R-induced rats.

The spike proteins of thesecoronaviruses are critical for host cell entry by receptors. Thus, searching forbroad-spectrum anti-coronavirus candidates, such as spike protein inhibitors, isvital and desirable due to the mutations in the spike protein. In this study, acombination of computer-aided drug design and biological verification was used todiscover active monomers from traditional Chinese medicine. Surface plasmonresonance (SPR) assays and NanoBit assays were used to verify the predicatedcompounds with their binding activities to spike proteins and inhibitoryactivities on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 interaction, respectively. Furthermore, anMTT assay was used to evaluate the cell toxicities of active compounds. As aresult, glycyrrhizic acid (ZZY-44) was found to be the most efficient andnontoxic broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus molecule in vitro, especially, thesignificant effect on SARS-CoV-2, which provided a theoretical basis for thestudy of the pharmacodynamic material basis of traditional Chinese medicineagainst SARS-CoV-2 and offered a lead compound for further structuralmodification in order to obtain more effective candidate drugs againstSARS-CoV-2.","Yu, Shaopeng, Zhu, Yuying, Xu, Jiaruo, Yao, Guangtao, Zhang, Pei, Wang, Mengge, Zhao, Yongfang, Lin, Guoqiang, Chen, Hongzhuan, Chen, Lili, Zhang, Jiange",2021,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2

Here, we investigatedwhether GS-KG9 and GS-E3D, bioactive ginseng extracts from Korean ginseng (Panaxginseng Meyer), inhibit BBB disruption following neuronal death in thehippocampus in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats showing type 1-like diabetesmellitus. GS-KG9 and GS-E3D (50, 150, or 300 mg/kg, twice a day for 4 weeks)administered orally showed antihyperglycemic activity in a dose-dependent mannerand significantly attenuated the increase in BBB permeability and loss of tightjunction proteins. GS-KG9 and GS-E3D also inhibited the expression and activationof matrix metalloproteinase-9 and the infiltration of macrophages into the brainparenchyma, especially into the hippocampal region. In addition, microglia andastrocyte activation in the hippocampus and the expression of proinflammatorymediators such as tnf-α, Il-1β, IL-6, cox-2, and inos were markedly alleviated inGS-KG9 and GS-E3D-treated group. Furthermore, apoptotic cell death of hippocampalneurons, especially in CA1 region, was significantly reduced in GS-KG9 andGS-E3D-treated groups as compared to vehicle control. These results suggest thatGS-KG9 and GS-E3D effectively prevent apoptotic cell death of hippocampal neuronsby inhibiting BBB disruption and may be a potential therapy for the treatment ofdiabetic patients.","Lee, Jee Youn, Park, Chan Sol, Choi, Hae Young, Yune, Tae Young",2020,Nutrients,2
TA047729,10.1155/2020/6096391,Dihydroartemisinin Modulates Apoptosis and Autophagy in Multiple Myeloma throughthe P38/MAPK and Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathways.,"Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), an active metabolite and derivative of artemisinin, isthe most effective antimalarial drug and has strong antitumor activity in varioustumor types. It has recently been reported that DHA can induce autophagy and hassignificant effects on multiple myeloma (MM), but the mechanisms and therelationship between the autophagy and apoptosis induced by DHA remain to beelucidated. Herein, we demonstrated that DHA significantly induces cell death ina dose- and time-dependent manner via the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosispathways. Moreover, DHA-induced autophagy, which plays a prodeath role in MM, canregulate canonical apoptosis and vice versa. Furthermore, the P38/MAPK signalingpathway is responsible for decreased autophagy and increased apoptosis. DHAinduces autophagy and apoptosis also through the inhibition of the Wnt/β-cateninsignaling pathway. In addition, DHA shows a strong effect in a xenograft mousemodel. Collectively, these findings reveal that DHA, as an artemisinin-baseddrug, could be an effective and safe therapeutic agent for MM.","Wu, Xiuhua, Liu, Yang, Zhang, Enfan, Chen, Jing, Huang, Xi, Yan, Haimeng, Cao, Wen, Qu, Jianwei, Gu, Huiyao, Xu, Ruyi, He, Jingsong, Cai, Zhen",2020,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2
TA047746,10.1155/2020/9782062,Neuroprotection Effect of Astragaloside IV from 2-DG-Induced EndoplasmicReticulum Stress.,"OBJECTIVE: Astragaloside IV shows neuroprotective activity, but its mechanismremains unclear. To investigate whether astragaloside IV protects fromendoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), we focus on the regulation of glycogensynthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP)by astragaloside IV in neuronal cell PC12. METHODS AND RESULTS: PC12 cellstreated with different concentrations of ERS inductor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)(25-500 μM) showed a significant increase of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP 94 expressions and a decrease of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester(TMRE) fluorescence intensity and mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), withthe peak effect seen at 50 μM, indicating that 2-DG induces ERS and the mPTPopening. Similarly, 50 μM of astragaloside IV increased the GSK-3βphosphorylation at Ser9 most significantly. Next, we examined the neuroprotectionof astragaloside IV by dividing the PC12 cells into control group, 2-DG treatmentgroup, astragaloside IV plus 2-DG treatment group, and astragaloside IV onlygroup. PC12 cells treated with 50 μM 2-DG for different time courses (0-36 hr)showed a significant increase of Cleaved-Caspase-3 with the peak at 6 hr. 2-DGsignificantly induced cell apoptosis and increased the green fluorescenceintensity of Annexin V-FITC, and these effects were reversed by astragaloside IV.Such a result indicates that astragaloside IV protected neural cell survival fromERS. 2-DG treatment significantly increased the expressions of inositol-requiringER-to-nucleus signal kinase 1 (IRE1), phosphor-protein kinase R-like ER kinase(p-PERK), but not affect the transcription factor 6 (ATF6) expression. 2-DGtreatment significantly decreased the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and significantlyreduced the TMRE fluorescence intensity and ∆Ψm, following mPTP open.Astragaloside IV significantly inhibited the above effects caused by 2-DG, exceptthe upregulation of ATF6 protein. Taken together, astragaloside IV significantlyinhibited the ERS caused by 2-DG. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested thatastragaloside IV protects PC12 cells from ERS by inactivation of GSK-3β andpreventing the mPTP opening. The GRP 78, GRP 94, IRE1, and PERK signalingpathways but not ATF6 are responsible for GSK-3β inactivation and neuroprotectionby astragaloside IV.","Fu, Yu, Cai, Jianhang, Xi, Mengyao, He, Yifei, Zhao, Yang, Zheng, Yi, Zhang, Yidong, Xi, Jinkun, He, Yonggui",2020,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2
TA047756,10.18632/aging.102985,Microarray analysis of verbenalin-treated human amniotic epithelial cells revealstherapeutic potential for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a major world health problem as thepopulation ages. There is still no available treatment that can stop or reversethe progression of AD. Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs), an alternativesource for stem cells, have shown neuroprotective and neurorestorative potentialswhen transplanted in vivo. Besides, studies have suggested that stem cell primingwith plant-derived bioactive compounds can enhance stem cell proliferation anddifferentiation and improve the disease-treating capability of stem cells.Verbenalin is an iridoid glucoside found in medicinal herbs of Verbenaceaefamily. In the present study, we have conducted microarray gene expressionprofiling of verbenalin-treated hAECs to explore its therapeutic potential forAD. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed verbenalin treatment significantlyenriched AD-associated gene sets. Genes associated with lysosomal dysfunction,pathologic angiogenesis, pathologic protein aggregation, circadian rhythm,age-related neurometabolism, and neurogenesis were differentially expressed inthe verbenalin-treated hAECs compared to control cells. Additionally, theneuroprotective effect of verbenalin was confirmed against amyloid beta-inducedneurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Our present study is thefirst to report the therapeutic potential of verbenalin for AD; however, furtherin-depth research in the in vitro and in vivo models are required to confirm ourpreliminary findings.","Ferdousi, Farhana, Kondo, Shinji, Sasaki, Kazunori, Uchida, Yoshiaki, Ohkohchi, Nobuhiro, Zheng, Yun-Wen, Isoda, Hiroko",2020,Aging,2
TA047765,10.3390/ijms21218068,The Effect of Artemisinin on Inflammation-Associated Lymphangiogenesis inExperimental Acute Colitis.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by inflammation, angiogenesis,and lymphangiogenesis. Artemisinin (Art), a chemical compound isolated fromArtemisia annua L. (sweet wormwood), has several biochemical properties includingantibacterial, anticancer, anti-inflammation, and anti-angiogenesis effects. Weinvestigated the effects of Art on inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis in adextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse acute colitis model. The mice wereorally administered Art for 7 days before being evaluated using the diseaseactivity index (DAI) and documenting colonic inflammatory changes, colon edema,microvessel density, lymphatic vessel density (LVD), proinflammatory cytokinelevels, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C and VEGF-D/VEGF receptor(VEGFR)-3 mRNA expression levels in colon tissue. Art reduced DSS-inducedlymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1-positive LVD. Art also reducedthe symptoms of colitis, improved tissue histology, and relieved inflammatoryedema in mice affected by colitis. In addition, Art decreased the infiltration ofimmunomodulatory cells and inflammatory cytokines, which involved reduction ofVEGF-C, -D, and VEGFR-3 expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that Artameliorates inflammation-driven lymphangiogenesis in an experimental colitismouse model via the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling pathway, implicating this pathway asa potential target for the treatment of IBD.","Lee, Ae Sin, Hur, Haeng Jeon, Sung, Mi Jeong",2020,International journal of molecular sciences,2

The present studyinvestigated the mechanisms of CD-induced apoptosis in T24 human bladder cancercells. CD inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration and time-dependentmanner. CD-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species and reducedmitochondrial membrane potential, associated with reduced expression of Bcl-2 andincreased levels of cytosolic cytochrome c, cleaved PARP-1 and caspase-3. Inaddition, CD treatment led to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and inhibitedexpression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4 and led to increasedlevels of p21, p27Kip1 and p53. All of these events were accompanied with areduction of pEGFR, pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, pAkt, pmTOR, pP70S6K1, HIF-1α, c-Myc andVEGF. RNAseq-based analysis revealed that CD-induced cell death was characterisedby an increased expression of stress and apoptotic-related genes as well asinhibition of the cell cycle-related genes.

TA047876,10.1111/jcmm.15779,Celastrol attenuates arterial and valvular calcification via inhibitingBMP2/Smad1/5 signalling.,"Vascular calcification is an important risk factor for the mortality andmorbidity in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, until now there is nocertain medication targeting vascular calcification in CKD. In this study, weexplored the inhibitory effect of celastrol on high calcium-induced vascularcalcification and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Cell proliferation assayshowed that celastrol inhibited aortic valve interstitial cell (VIC) and vascularsmooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation when its concentration was higher than0.6 μmol/L. 0.8 μmol/L celastrol inhibited the expression of osteogenic genes andcalcium deposition induced by high-calcium medium in both AVICs and VSMCs. Inmouse vascular calcification model induced by adenine combined with vitamin D,alizarin red and immunostaining showed that celastrol inhibited pro-calcificationgene expression and calcium deposition in aortic wall and aortic valve tissues.At the molecular level, celastrol inhibited the increase of BMP2, phosphorylatedSmad1/5 (p-Smad1/5) and non-phosphorylated β-catenin (n-p-β-catenin) induced byhigh-calcium medium both in vitro and in vivo. Also, BMP2 overexpression reversedthe anti-calcification effects of celastrol by recovering the decrease ofp-Smad1/5 and n-p-β-catenin. Furthermore, celastrol prevented the up-regulationof BMPRII and down-regulation of Smad6 induced by high calcium, and thisprotectory effect can be abolished by BMP2 overexpression. In conclusion, ourdata for the first time demonstrate that celastrol attenuates highcalcium-induced arterial and valvular calcification by inhibiting BMP2/Smad1/5signalling, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for arterial andvalvular calcification in patients with CKD.","Su, Zhongping, Zong, Pengyu, Chen, Ji, Yang, Shuo, Shen, Yihui, Lu, Yan, Yang, Chuanxi, Kong, Xiangqing, Sheng, Yanhui, Sun, Wei",2020,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2
TA047913,10.1155/2020/7815325,Aescin Protects Neuron from Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via Regulating thePRAS40/mTOR Signaling Pathway.,"Ischemic stroke is one of the major causes of disability; widely use ofendovascular thrombectomy or intravenous thrombolysis leads to more attention onischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R injury). Aescin, a natural compound isolatedfrom the seed of the horse chestnut, has been demonstrated anti-inflammatory andantiedematous effects previously. This study was aimed at determining whetheraescin could induce protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury andexploring the underlying mechanisms in vitro. Primary cultured neurons weresubjected to 2 hours of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 24 hours ofsimulated reperfusion. Aescin, which worked in a dose-dependent manner, couldsignificantly attenuate neuronal death and reduce lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)release after OGD and simulated reperfusion. Aescin treatment at a concentrationof 50 μg/ml provided protection with fewer side effects. Results showed thataescin upregulated the phosphorylation level of PRAS40 and proteins in the mTORsignaling pathway, including S6K and 4E-BP1. However, PRAS40 knockdown orrapamycin treatment was able to undermine and even abolish the protective effectsof aescin; meanwhile, the levels of phosphorylation PRAS40 and proteins in themTOR signaling pathway were obviously decreased. Hence, our study demonstratedthat aescin provided neuronal protective effects against I/R injury through thePRAS40/mTOR signaling pathway in vitro. These results might contribute to thepotential clinical application of aescin and provide a therapeutic target onsubsequent cerebral I/R injury.","Gao, Xinjie, Yang, Heng, Su, Jiabin, Xiao, Weiping, Ni, Wei, Gu, Yuxiang",2020,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2
TA047951,10.3390/v12101093,Thapsigargin at Non-Cytotoxic Levels Induces a Potent Host Antiviral Responsethat Blocks Influenza A Virus Replication.,"Influenza A virus is a major global pathogen of humans, and there is an unmetneed for effective antivirals. Current antivirals against influenza A virusdirectly target the virus and are vulnerable to mutational resistance. Harnessingan effective host antiviral response is an attractive alternative. We show thatbrief exposure to low, non-toxic doses of thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of thesarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) ATPase pump, promptly elicits anextended antiviral state that dramatically blocks influenza A virus production.Crucially, oral administration of TG protected mice against lethal virusinfection and reduced virus titres in the lungs of treated mice. TG-induced ERstress unfolded protein response appears as a key driver responsible foractivating a spectrum of host antiviral defences that include an enhanced typeI/III interferon response. Our findings suggest that TG is potentially a viablehost-centric antiviral for the treatment of influenza A virus infection withoutthe inherent problem of drug resistance.","Goulding, Leah V, Yang, Jiayun, Jiang, Zhimin, Zhang, Hongyu, Lea, Daniel, Emes, Richard D, Dottorini, Tania, Pu, Juan, Liu, Jinhua, Chang, Kin-Chow",2020,Viruses,2

Neuroinflammation caused by depositionof amyloid β (Aβ) is one of the most important pathological causes in AD. Theisoprenoid phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) has recently been found in mammalsand was shown to be an endogenous hormone, acting in stress conditions. AlthoughABA has been associated with anti-inflammatory effects and reduced cognitiveimpairment in several studies, the mechanisms of ABA in AD has not beenascertained clearly. To investigate the clearance of Aβ and anti-inflammatoryeffects of ABA, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction andimmunoassay. ABA treatment inhibited Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation, thusresulting in improvement of memory impairment in 5xFAD mice. Interestingly, theseeffects were not associated with activation of peroxisome proliferator-activatedreceptor gamma, well known as a molecular target of ABA, but related withmodulation of the LanC-like protein 2 (LANCL2), known as a receptor of ABA. Takentogether, our results indicate that ABA reduced Aβ deposition, neuroinflammation,and memory impairment, which is the most characteristic pathology of AD, via theupregulation of LANCL2. These data suggest that ABA might be a candidate fortherapeutics for AD treatment.","Jeon, Seung Ho, Kim, Namkwon, Ju, Yeon-Joo, Gee, Min Sung, Lee, Danbi, Lee, Jong Kil",2020,International journal of molecular sciences,2

Previous research has found that in A549 cells, β-elemeneincreased the expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase(AMPK) α (AMPKα), which negatively regulates the Warburg effect. Bioinformaticspredicted that binding sites exist between AMPKα and miR-301a-3p, an miRNA thathas shown oncogenic function in many cancers. The aim of this work was toinvestigate the effect of β-elemene on the Warburg effect in non-small-cell lungcancer (NSCLC) cells and its mechanism. Herein, the expression of miR-301a-3p wasevaluated in NSCLC cells. Then, miR-301a-3p was overexpressed or silenced bymimics or inhibitors, respectively, followed by treatment with AMPK agonists orantagonists. NSCLC cells subjected to miR-301a-3p overexpression or inhibitionwere further treated with β-elemene. The results demonstrated that AMPKα wastargeted and negatively regulated by miR-301a-3p. AMPKα agonists attenuated theWarburg effect in NSCLC cells induced by miR-301a-3p, as evidenced by thedecrease in glucose level, lactic acid level, and expression ofmetabolism-related enzymes (glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 1 (HK1),and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)). Additionally, β-elemene suppressed theexpression of miR-301a-3p, enhanced that of AMPKα, and inhibited the Warburgeffect in NSCLC cells. The results indicated that β-elemene attenuates theWarburg effect in NSCLC cells, possibly by mediating the miR-301a-3p/AMPKα axis.","Li, Lin, Zhao, Dongkai, Cheng, Guangyu, Li, Qingjie, Chu, Yunjie, Chu, Hongbo, Ding, Yunlu, Li, Chikun",2020,Bioscience reports,2

The dose-dependent therapeutic effect of Ginkgo bilobaextract EGb 761 on vestibular compensation was investigated by behavioral testingand serial cerebral [(18)F]-Fluoro-desoxyglucose ([(18)F]-FDG)-μPET in a ratmodel of unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL). Five groups of 8 animals each weretreated with EGb 761-supplemented food at doses of 75, 37.5 or 18.75 mg/kg bodyweight 6 weeks prior and 15 days post UL (groups A,B,C), control food prior andEGb 761-supplemented food (75 mg/kg) for 15 days post UL (group D), or controlfood throughout (group E). Plasma levels of EGb 761 components bilobalide,ginkgolide A and B were analyzed prior and 15 days post UL. Behavioral testingincluded clinical scoring of nystagmus, postural asymmetry, head roll tilt, bodyrotation during sensory perturbation and instrumental registration of mobility inan open field before and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 15 days after UL. Whole-brain[(18)F]-FDG-μPET was recorded before and 1, 3, 7, 15 days after UL. The EGb 761group A (75 mg/kg prior/post UL) showed a significant reduction of nystagmusscores (day 3 post UL), of postural asymmetry (1, 3, 7 days post UL), and anincreased mobility in the open field (day 7 post UL) as compared to controls(group E). Application of EGb 761 at doses of 37.5 and 18.75 mg/kg prior/post UL(groups B,C) resulted in faster recovery of postural asymmetry, but did notinfluence mobility relative to controls. Locomotor velocity increased with higherplasma levels of ginkgolide A and B. [(18)F]-FDG-μPET revealed a significantdecrease of the regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) in the vestibularnuclei and cerebellum and an increase in the hippocampal formation with higherplasma levels of ginkgolides and bilobalide 1 and 3 days post UL. Decrease ofrCGM in the vestibular nucleus area and increase in the hippocampal formationwith higher plasma levels persisted until day 15 post UL. In conclusion, Ginkgobiloba extract EGb 761 improves vestibulo-ocular motor, vestibulo-spinalcompensation, and mobility after UL. This rat study supports the translationalapproach to investigate EGb 761 at higher dosages for acceleration of vestibularcompensation in acute vestibular loss.","Lindner, Magdalena, Gosewisch, Astrid, Eilles, Eva, Branner, Christina, Krämer, Anja, Oos, Rosel, Wolf, Eckhard, Ziegler, Sibylle, Bartenstein, Peter, Brandt, Thomas, Dieterich, Marianne, Zwergal, Andreas",2019,Frontiers in neurology,2

TA048172,10.4103/1673-5374.245467,Essential oils and functional herbs for healthy aging.,"As total life expectancy increases, the prevalence of age-related diseases suchas diabetes and Alzheimer's disease is also increasing. Many hypotheses aboutAlzheimer's disease have been developed, including cholinergic neuron damage,oxidative stress, and inflammation. Acetylcholine is a major neurotransmitter inthe brain and cholinergic deficits leads to cognitive dysfunction and decline.Recent studies have linked diabetes as a risk factor in developing Alzheimer'sdisease and other types of dementia. The incidence of patients with type IIdiabetes and increased levels and activity of α-amylase is higher in patientswith dementia. It has been shown that aromatherapy with essential oils from themint family can improve cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease patients.Selected monoterpenoids from these essential oils are reported to inhibitacetylcholinesterase, both in vitro and in vivo. Terpenoids are small,fat-soluble organic molecules that can transfer across nasal mucosa if inhaled,or penetrate through the skin after topical application, enter into the blood andcross the blood-brain barrier. Recent evidence supports the idea that the commonconstituents of essential oils also inhibit α-amylase, a starch digestive enzymethat plays an important role in the control of diabetes. The mint family is afragrant plant family that contains most of the culinary herbs found in theMediterranean diet. The Mediterranean diet is considered to be one of thehealthiest diets in the world, and is found to be beneficial not only for theheart but also for the brain. Herbs used in this diet are rich in antioxidantsthat can prevent oxidative damage caused by free radicals. However, our studyshows that they also contain biologically active compounds with potent α-amylaseand acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. Consumption of fresh herbs canhelp boost memory and reduce sugar levels in the body. The use of herbs as afunctional food could lead to significant improvements in health. Cognitivestimulation with medical food and medical herbs could delay development ofcognitive decline, and improve the quality of life of Alzheimer's diseasepatients.

Many terpenes can also cross the blood-brain barrier.Therefore, topical application or inhalation of essential oils will also producea systemic effect.","Agatonovic-Kustrin, Snezana, Kustrin, Ella, Morton, David W",2019,Neural regeneration research,2
TA048202,10.3390/molecules24234256,"Evidence for Effective Inhibitory Actions on Hyperpolarization-Activated CationCurrent Caused by Ganoderma Triterpenoids, the Main Active Constitutents ofGanoderma Spores.","The triterpenoid fraction of Ganoderma (Ganoderma triterpenoids, GTs) has beenincreasingly demonstrated to provide effective antioxidant, neuroprotective orcardioprotective activities. However, whether GTs is capable of perturbing thetransmembrane ionic currents existing in electrically excitable cells is notthoroughly investigated. In this study, an attempt was made to study whether GTscould modify hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (I(h)) in pituitarytumor (GH(3)) cells and in HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes. In whole-cell currentrecordings, the addition of GTs produced a dose-dependent reduction in theamplitude of I(h) in GH(3) cells with an IC(50) value of 11.7 µg/mL, incombination with a lengthening in activation time constant of the current. GTs(10 µg/mL) also caused a conceivable shift in the steady-state activation curveof I(h) along the voltage axis to a more negative potential by approximately 11mV. Subsequent addition of neither 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine nor8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline, still in the presence of GTs, could attenuateGTs-mediated inhibition of I(h). In current-clamp voltage recordings, GTsdiminished the firing frequency of spontaneous action potentials in GH(3) cells,and it also decreased the amplitude of sag potential in response tohyperpolarizing current stimuli. In murine HL-1 cardiomyocytes, the GTs additionalso suppressed the amplitude of I(h) effectively. In DPCPX (1 µM)-treated HL-1cells, the inhibitory effect of GTs on I(h) remained efficacious. Collectively,the inhibition of I(h) caused by GTs is independent of its possible binding toadenosine receptors and it might have profound influence in electrical behaviorsof different types of electrically excitable cells (e.g., pituitary and heartcells) if similar in vitro or in vivo findings occur.","Chang, Wei-Ting, Gao, Zi-Han, Lo, Yi-Ching, Wu, Sheng-Nan",2019,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

TA048250,10.3390/biom9120861,Evaluating Iso-Mukaadial Acetate and Ursolic Acid Acetate as Plasmodiumfalciparum Hypoxanthine-Guanine-Xanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase Inhibitors.,"To date, Plasmodium falciparum is one of the most lethal strains of the malariaparasite. P. falciparum lacks the required enzymes to create its own purines viathe de novo pathway, thereby making Plasmodium falciparumhypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (PfHGXPT) a crucialenzyme in the malaria life cycle. Recently, studies have described iso-mukaadialacetate and ursolic acid acetate as promising antimalarials. However, the mode ofaction is still unknown, thus, the current study sought to investigate theselective inhibitory and binding actions of iso-mukaadial acetate and ursolicacid acetate against recombinant PfHGXPT using in-silico and experimentalapproaches. Recombinant PfHGXPT protein was expressed using E. coli BL21 cellsand homogeneously purified by affinity chromatography. Experimentally,iso-mukaadial acetate and ursolic acid acetate, respectively, demonstrated directinhibitory activity towards PfHGXPT in a dose-dependent manner. The bindingaffinity of iso-mukaadial acetate and ursolic acid acetate on the PfHGXPTdissociation constant (KD), where it was found that 0.0833 µM and 2.8396 µM,respectively, are indicative of strong binding. The mode of action for theobserved antimalarial activity was further established by a molecular dockingstudy. The molecular docking and dynamics simulations show specific interactionsand high affinity within the binding pocket of Plasmodium falciparum and humanhypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferases. The predicted in silicoabsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion/toxicity (ADME/T) propertiespredicted that the iso-mukaadial acetate ligand may follow the criteria fororally active drugs. The theoretical calculation derived from ADME, moleculardocking and dynamics provide in-depth information into the structural basis,specific bonding and non-bonding interactions governing the inhibition ofmalarial. Taken together, these findings provide a basis for the recommendationof iso-mukaadial acetate and ursolic acid acetate as high-affinity ligands anddrug candidates against PfHGXPT.","Opoku, Francis, Govender, Penny P, Pooe, Ofentse J, Simelane, Mthokozisi B C",2019,Biomolecules,2

(Asteraceae), besides the known4,15-iso-atriplicolide tiglate, -methacrylate and -isobutyrate, a hithertounknown STL was isolated. Its structure was solved by extensive NMR measurementsand confirmed by single crystal X-ray crystallography. This novel compound is astructural analog 4,15-iso-atriplicolide tiglate that possesses the same basicfuranoheliangolide skeleton but differs in the position of the oxo function whichis at C-2 instead of C-1, as well as in the fact that the oxygen atom of thefuranoid ring is part of a hemiketal structure at C-3 and a double bond betweenC-5 and C-6. For this new STL we propose the name heliantuberolide-8-O-tiglate.Its activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (causative agent of EastAfrican Human Typanosomiasis, Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas Disease), Leishmaniadonovani (Visceral Leishmaniasis) and Plasmodium falciparum (Tropical Malaria) aswell as cytotoxicity against rat skeletal myoblasts (L6 cell line) was determinedalong with those of the hitherto untested 4,15-iso-atriplicolide methacrylate andisobutyrate.

Solid tumorsrepresent the great majority of cancers (>90%) and the chemotherapeutic agentsused for their treatment are still characterized by variable efficacy andtoxicity. Sesquiterpene lactones are a group of naturally occurring compoundsthat have displayed a diverse range of biological activities including cytotoxicactivity. A series of oxygenated and oxy-nitrogenated derivatives (4⁻15) from thesesquiterpene lactones cumanin (1), helenalin (2), and hymenin (3) weresynthesized. The silylated derivatives of helenalin, compounds 13 and 14, werefound to be the most active against tumor cell lines, with GI(50) values rangingfrom 0.15 to 0.59 μM. The ditriazolyl cumanin derivative (11) proved to be moreactive and selective than cumanin in the tested breast, cervix, lung, and colontumor cell lines. This compound was the least toxic against splenocytes (CC(50) =524.1 µM) and exhibited the greatest selectivity on tumor cell lines. Thiscompound showed a GI(50) of 2.3 µM and a SI of 227.9 on WiDr human colon tumorcell lines.

Betulinic acid (BA) is a natural pentacyclictriterpene compound found in species of Betula, and it has been reported to haveantioxidant activity. The aim of the present study was to investigate theprotective effect of BA on T-2-toxin-induced testicular injury in mice andexplore its molecular mechanism. Sixty adult male mice were randomly divided intogroups. The mice were pretreated orally with BA (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) dailyfor 14 days, and the T-2 toxin (4 mg/kg body weight) was administered viaintraperitoneal injection to induce oxidative stress after the lastadministration of BA. BA pretreatment significantly increased the secreted levelsof testosterone and sperm motility. Moreover, BA pretreatment significantlyincreased the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), the activity of SOD and CAT,and the content of GSH, and it reduced the content of MDA. Furthermore, BArelieved testicular injury and reduced the number of apoptotic cells, and itsignificantly decreased the protein expression of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), signaltransducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), caspsae-3, andBcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). BA also increased the expression of B-celllymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). We suggest that BA reduced the oxidative damage induced byT-2 toxin, and that these protective effects may be partially mediated by theJAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.","Wu, Jing, Yang, Chenglin, Liu, Juan, Chen, Jiaxin, Huang, Chao, Wang, Ji, Liang, Zengenni, Wen, Lixin, Yi, Jin-E, Yuan, Zhihang",2019,Biomolecules,2

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is aregulator for different biological responses, including cell proliferation anddifferentiation. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), constitutive NF-κB has beendetected in more than 50% of cases, enabling leukemic cells to resist apoptosisand stimulate uncontrolled proliferation. We evaluated NF-kB expression in bonemarrow samples from 103 patients with AML using quantitative real time polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR) and found that expression was increased in 80.5% (83 out103) of these patients with AML in comparison to the control group. Furthermore,overexpressed transmembrane glycoprotein (CD44) on leukemic cells in comparisonto normal cells is known to play an important role in leukemic cell engraftmentand survival. We designed poly lactide co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticlesconjugated with antiCD44 and encapsulating parthenolide (PTL), a nuclear factorkappa B (NF-kB) inhibitor, in order to improve the selectivity and targeting ofleukemic cells and to spare normal cells. In vitro, in leukemic cell linesKasumi-1, KG-1a, and THP-1, proliferation was decreased by 40% (** p < 0.01) with5 µM PLGA-antiCD44-PTL nanoparticles in comparison to the same concentration offree PTL (~10%). The higher uptake of the nanoparticles by leukemic cells wasconfirmed with confocal microscopy.

In order to explore the traitsof mint volatiles as attractant cues for enemies of two-spotted spider mites, weperformed Y-tube olfactometer assays of predatory mites, Phytoseiulus persimilisand Neoseiulus californicus, towards three mint species, apple mint, candy mint,and spearmint, as odor source. Clean candy mint and spearmint were attractive toP. persimilis, when compared with clean air and undamaged Phaseolus vulgarisplants serving as the target crop. Moreover, clean candy mint plants were evenmore attractive than volatiles from P. vulgaris plants damaged by spider mites.These predator responses were induced additively by candy mint volatiles plusvolatiles from damaged P. vulgaris plants, as shown using both Y-tubeolfactometer and open-space assay systems. However, the number of spider miteeggs consumed by P. persimilis on P. vulgaris plants did not differ in thepresence compared to the absence of mint volatiles, indicating that mintvolatiles affect the attraction but not the appetite of P. persimilis. Together,these findings suggest that the use of candy mint and spearmint as CPs is anideal platform for spider mite pest management via the attraction of predatorymites.","Togashi, Kazuki, Goto, Mifumi, Rim, Hojun, Hattori, Sayaka, Ozawa, Rika, Arimura, Gen-Ichiro",2019,Scientific reports,2

Initially,the structural examination was conducted using various spectroscopic techniques,such as FTIR, TLC, and UV-visible spectroscopy, which are important indetermining substituents, functional groups, and the presence of conjugateddouble bonds in BSO. From the FTIR spectra, a variety of sharp, strong, and weakpeaks were specified relating to the main components of thymoquinone (TQ),dithymoquinone, thymohydroquinone, and thymol in BSO. The results of UV-visiblespectroscopy confirmed the presence of thymoquinone as a major compound, andconjugated double bonds were also found. In addition, qualitative TLC analysiswas used to identify thymoquinone from the methanol-extracted layer in BSO, bycalculating the retention factor (R (f)) value. Furthermore, antimicrobialactivity of BSO was studied against various types of bacteria. Strong bacterialinhibitory effects were observed, especially against Bacillus subtilis, with anaverage inhibition zone of 15.74 mm. Moreover, through the use of the MTT assayin vitro, it was shown that BSO does not exhibit any cytotoxicity towards humanperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). It was also found from the structuralcharacterization of BSO that the existence of TQ is responsible for potentialantibacterial activity without any cytotoxic effects. The main observation ofthis work is that BSO has antimicrobial activity even againstmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).","Mohammed, Sewara J, Amin, Hassan H H, Aziz, Shujahadeen B, Sha, Aram M, Hassan, Sarwar, Abdul Aziz, Jeza M, Rahman, Heshu S",2019,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2

Reendothelialization is an essential processin vascular injury following interventional therapy, and hyperglycemia indiabetes mellitus (DM) plays an important role in damaging endothelial layerintegrity, leading to the retardance of reendothelialization and excessiveneointimal formation. Notoginsenoside Fc (Fc), a novel saponin isolated fromPanax notoginseng, effectively counteracts platelet aggregation. Nevertheless,the potential effects and molecular mechanisms of Fc on reendothelialization haveyet to be explored. In this study, we present novel findings that show thebenefit of Fc in accelerating reendothelialization and alleviating excessiveneointimal formation following carotid artery injury in diabetic Sprague-Dawleyrats in vivo. Simultaneously, the decreased autophagy of the injured carotidartery in diabetic rats was restored by Fc treatment. Our in vitro results alsodemonstrated that Fc promoted endothelial cell proliferation and migration underhigh-glucose treatment by increasing autophagy.

Radiotherapy is one ofthe most effective cytotoxic treatments. However, the radiosensitivity of ovariantissues limits its therapeutic outcome and results in the depletion of theprimordial follicle and loss of fertility. Therefore, the need for an effectiveradioprotective therapy is evident especially when none of the current clinicallyused modalities for radioprotection succeeds efficiently. The present studyinvestigated the potential radioprotective effect of carvacrol (CAR) (80 mg) orthymol (80 mg) on gamma- (γ-) irradiation-induced ovarian damage as well as theirrole in the cross-talk between IGF-1 and TNF-α signaling and antioxidativeactivity. In immature female Wister rats, a single dose of whole-body irradiation(3.2 Gy, LD(20)) produced considerable ovarian damage, which was evident byhistopathological findings and hormonal changes. Interestingly, pretreatment withCAR or thymol significantly enhanced the follicular development and restored theanti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), E2, and FSH levels. Both essential oils improvedthe irradiation-mediated oxidative stress and reduction in proliferating cellnuclear antigen (PCNA) expression. Moreover, irradiated rats exhibited an inverserelationship between IGF-1 and TNF-α levels two days post irradiation, which wasfurther inverted by the pretreatment with CAR and thymol and ought to contributein their radioprotective mechanisms. In conclusion, CAR and thymol showed aradioprotective effect and rescued the ovarian reserve mainly throughcounteracting oxidative stress and the dysregulated cross-talk between IGF-1 andTNF-α.","Mahran, Yasmen F, Badr, Amira M, Aldosari, Alhanouf, Bin-Zaid, Raghad, Alotaibi, Hind N",2019,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2

Among themultiple methods used to promote colocalisation, enzyme fusion is probably thesimplest. Inspired by natural systems, we have explored the metabolicconsequences of spatial reorganizations of the catalytic domains ofXanthophyllomyces dendrorhous carotenoid enzymes produced in Saccharomycescerevisiae. Synthetic genes encoding bidomain enzymes composed of CrtI and CrtBdomains from the natural CrtYB fusion were connected in the two possibleorientations, using natural and synthetic linkers. A tridomain enzyme (CrtB,CrtI, CrtY) harboring the full β-carotene producing pathway was also constructed.Our results demonstrate that domain order and linker properties considerablyimpact both the expression and/or stability of the constructed proteins and thefunctionality of the catalytic domains, all concurring to either diminish orboost specific enzymatic steps of the metabolic pathway. Remarkably, the yield ofβ-carotene production doubled with the tridomain fusion while precursoraccumulation decreased, leading to an improvement of the pathway efficiency, whencompared to the natural system. Our data strengthen the idea that fusion ofenzymatic domains is an appropriate technique not only to achieve spatialconfinement and enhance the metabolic flux but also to produce molecules noteasily attainable with natural enzymatic configurations, even with membrane boundenzymes.","Rabeharindranto, Hery, Castaño-Cerezo, Sara, Lautier, Thomas, Garcia-Alles, Luis F, Treitz, Christian, Tholey, Andreas, Truan, Gilles",2019,Metabolic engineering communications,2

Additionally, carnosol promotes the proteinexpression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) to keep the integrityof intercellular junctions, which indicated that it protected microvascularbarrier in oxidative stress. Meanwhile, we investigated that carnosol caninterrupt Nrf2-Keap1 protein-protein interaction and stimulatedantioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-driven luciferase activity in vitro.Mechanistically, we showed that carnosol promotes the expression of hemeoxygenase 1(HO-1) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2(Nrf2). It canalso promote the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).Collectively, our data support the notion that carnosol is a protective agent inHMVECs and has the potential for therapeutic use in the treatments ofmicrovascular endothelial cell injury.","Li, Xi, Zhang, Qiao, Hou, Ning, Li, Jing, Liu, Min, Peng, Sha, Zhang, Yuxin, Luo, Yinzhen, Zhao, Bowen, Wang, Shifeng, Zhang, Yanling, Qiao, Yanjiang",2019,International journal of molecular sciences,2
TA048712,10.3390/molecules24101932,Potential of a Small Molecule Carvacrol in Management of Vegetable Diseases.,"Carvacrol, a plant-derived volatile small molecule, is effective against variousagents that can cause damage to humans, the food processing industry, and plants,and is considered a safe substance for human consumption. In this shortcommunication, previous studies on the effectiveness of carvacrol against variousagents, particularly plant pathogens and their associated mechanisms aredescribed. In our study, carvacrol was found to be effective on media againstseveral soilborne pathogens and in planta against three foliar pathogens(Xanthomonas perforans, Alternaria tomatophila, and Podosphaeraxanthii) ofimportant vegetable crops in south Florida of the United States. Current researchfindings indicated that the effectiveness of carvacrol against various plantpathogens tested was associated with its direct bactericidal/fungicidal effect,which was affected greatly by its volatility. Development of new formulations toovercome the volatility and to prolong the effectiveness of carvacrol was alsopresented. Our studies on carvacrol suggested that, with advanced development ofnew formulations, carvacrol could be used as a promising tool in the integratedpest management for bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens of important vegetablecrops in Florida, the USA, and the world.","Liu, Qingchun, Qiao, Kang, Zhang, Shouan",2019,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA048750,10.1194/jlr.RA119000317,A nematode sterol C4α-methyltransferase catalyzes a new methylation reactionresponsible for sterol diversity.,"Primitive sterol evolution plays an important role in fossil recordinterpretation and offers potential therapeutic avenues for human diseaseresulting from nematode infections. Recognizing that C4-methyl stenol products[8(14)-lophenol] can be synthesized in bacteria while C4-methyl stanol products(dinosterol) can be synthesized in dinoflagellates and preserved as steranebiomarkers in ancient sedimentary rock is key to eukaryotic sterol evolution. Inthis regard, nematodes have been proposed to convert dietary cholesterol to8(14)-lophenol by a secondary metabolism pathway that could involve sterol C4methylation analogous to the C2 methylation of hopanoids (radicle-type mechanism)or C24 methylation of sterols (carbocation-type mechanism). Here, wecharacterized dichotomous cholesterol metabolic pathways in Caenorhabditiselegans that generate 3-oxo sterol intermediates in separate paths to lophanol(4-methyl stanol) and 8(14)-lophenol (4-methyl stenol). We uncovered alternateC3-sterol oxidation and Δ(7) desaturation steps that regulate sterol flux fromwhich branching metabolite networks arise, while lophanol/8(14)-lophenolformation is shown to be dependent on a sterol C4α-methyltransferse (4-SMT) thatrequires 3-oxo sterol substrates and catalyzes a newly discovered 3-keto-enoltautomerism mechanism linked to S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methylation.Alignment-specific substrate-binding domains similarly conserved in 4-SMT and24-SMT enzymes, despite minimal amino acid sequence identity, suggests divergencefrom a common, primordial ancestor in the evolution of methyl sterols. Thecombination of these results provides evolutionary leads to sterol diversity andpoints to cryptic C4-methyl steroidogenic pathways of targeted convergence thatmediate lineage-specific adaptations.-.","Zhou, Wenxu, Fisher, Paxtyn M, Vanderloop, Boden H, Shen, Yun, Shi, Huazhong, Maldonado, Adrian J, Leaver, David J, Nes, W David",2020,Journal of lipid research,2

However, application of these recombinantenzymes for food-grade preparation of minor ginsenosides are limited by the lackof suitable expression hosts and low productivity. In this study, Corynebacteriumglutamicum ATCC13032, a GRAS strain that has been used extensively for theindustrial-grade production of additives for foodstuffs, was employed to expressa novel β-glucosidase (MT619) from Microbacterium testaceum ATCC 15829 with highginsenoside-transforming activity. A cellulose-binding module was additionallyfused to the N-terminus of MT619 for immobilization on cellulose, which is anabundant and safe material. Via one-step immobilization, the fusion protein incell lysates was efficiently immobilized on regenerated amorphous cellulose at ahigh density (maximum 984 mg/g cellulose), increasing the enzyme concentration by286-fold. The concentrated and immobilized enzyme showed strong conversionactivities against protopanaxadiol- and protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides forthe production of CK and F(1). Using gram-scale ginseng extracts as substrates,the immobilized enzyme produced 7.59 g/L CK and 9.42 g/L F(1) in 24 h. To thebest of our knowledge, these are the highest reported product concentrations ofCK and F(1), and this is the first time that a recombinant enzyme has beenimmobilized on cellulose for the preparation of minor ginsenosides. This safe,convenient, and efficient production method could also be effectively exploitedin the preparation of food-processing recombinant enzymes in the pharmaceutical,functional food, and cosmetics industries.","Cui, Chang-Hao, Jeon, Byeong-Min, Fu, Yaoyao, Im, Wan-Taek, Kim, Sun-Chang",2019,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2

Theregulating effects on inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral serum and relatedmechanisms are also discussed. METHODS: First, TP and MTX were prepared as ananosuspension, and the EAM model was successfully established in rats withcardiac myosin. Then, the effect of TP and MTX suspensions was tested in an EAMmodel. RESULTS: Results revealed that both TP and MTX suspensions could reducethe degree of myocardial fibrosis and delay the remodeling process of the leftventricle which could further improve cardiac function. Finally, it was foundthat inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral serum were regulated by thenonspecific immune system and the inhibition of nuclear factor-κB signaling mighthave partly occurred due to this mechanism. CONCLUSION: In summary, this studyprovided a complete foundation for EAM therapy of profound clinical relevance.","Li, Wei, Gong, Kaizheng, Ding, Yuan, Chaurasiya, Birenda, Ni, Yue, Wu, Yong, Zhao, Pei, Shen, Yan, Zhang, Zhengang, Webster, Thomas J",2019,International journal of nanomedicine,2
TA048898,10.1155/2019/4810217,Efficacy of Artesunate against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Mediated by Iron.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of causing a variety of chronic infections dueto the formation of biofilms. Iron is essential for growth of Pseudomonasaeruginosa, and therapies that interfere with iron may help treat P. aeruginosainfections. Herein, we investigated whether artesunate, which is a type ofiron-dependent drug, could influence Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation andstructure, including the underlying mechanisms. Artesunate could enhancetwitching motility significantly and decrease the proportion of surviving cellsin Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in a dose-dependent manner. Artesunatetreatment also reduced biofilm thickness, diffusion in the biomass, and thecontent of Fe(II). However, changes in biofilm structure and ion concentrationwere very similar following treatment with 512 μg/ml and 1024 μg/ml artesunate.Interestingly, both biofilm structure and surviving cell fraction were recoveredafter iron supplementation. These results suggest that artesunate interferes withPseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms by decreasing bacterial viability and enhancingtwitching motility in an iron-independent manner.","Bao, Lei, Guo, Jinjin, Feng, Lei, Zhou, Xianjie, Lu, Qi",2019,BioMed research international,2
TA048947,10.3390/md17110619,Lemnalol Modulates the Electrophysiological Characteristics and CalciumHomeostasis of Atrial Myocytes.,"Sepsis, an inflammatory response to infection provoked by lipopolysaccharide(LPS), is associated with high mortality, as well as ischemic stroke andnew-onset atrial arrhythmia. Severe bacterial infections causing sepsis alwaysresult in profound physiological changes, including fever, hypotension,arrhythmia, necrosis of tissue, systemic multi-organ dysfunction and finallydeath. LPS challenge-induced inflammatory responses during sepsis may increasethe likelihood of the arrhythmogenesis. Lemnalol is known to possess potentanti-inflammatory effects. This study examined whether Lemnalol (0.1 μM) couldmodulate the electrophysiological characteristics and calcium homeostasis ofatrial myocytes under the influence of LPS (1μg/mL). Under challenge with LPS,Lemnalol-treated LA myocytes, had a longer AP duration at 20%, 50% and 90%repolarization of the amplitude, compared to the LPS-treated cells.LPS-challenged LA myocytes showed increased late sodium current, Na(+)-Ca(2+)exchanger current, transient outward current, rapid component of delayedrectifier potassium current, tumor necrosis factor-α, NF-κB and increasedphosphorylation of ryanodine receptor (RyR), but a lower L-type Ca(2+) currentthan the control LA myocytes. Exposure to Lemnalol reversed the LPS-inducedeffects. The LPS-treated and control groups of LA myocytes, with or without theexistence of Lemnalol. showed no apparent alterations in the sodium currentamplitude or Cav1.2 expression. The expression of sarcoendoplasmic reticulumcalcium transport ATPase (SERCA2) was reduced by LPS treatment, while Lemnalolameliorated the LPS-induced alterations. The phosphorylation of RyR was enhancedby LPS treatment, while Lemnalol attenuated the LPS-induced alterations. Inconclusion, Lemnalol modulates LPS-induced alterations of LA calcium homeostasisand blocks the NF-κB pathways, which may contribute to the attenuation ofLPS-induced arrhythmogenesis.","Tai, Buh-Yuan, Wen, Zhi-Hong, Cheng, Pao-Yun, Yang, Hsiang-Yu, Duh, Chang-Yih, Chen, Ping-Nan, Hsu, Chih-Hsueng",2019,Marine drugs,2

Recent research has found that artemether can inhibitgrowth and induce apoptosis of cancer cells, although the mechanism is not clear.The present study aimed to explore the correlation between the HSP90/Akt pathwayand artemether-induced apoptosis of Cal27 cells. A cell counting kit-8 and flowcytometry were used to detect the proliferation and apoptosis of Cal27cells, respectively, mRNA expression was examined by quantitative RT-PCR, andprotein expression was detected by western blotting. Our data revealed thatartemether can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of Cal27 cells. As theartemether concentration was increased, we observed downregulation of theexpression of HSP90, p-Akt and p-mTOR in Cal27 cells, whereas the expression ofAkt was not significantly changed. We also observed a time-dependent decrease inthe expression of HSP90, p-Akt and p-mTOR during exposure to 0.1 mg·mL(-1)artemether. In conclusion, the HSP90/Akt pathway may be involved inartemether-induced apoptosis of Cal27 cells.","Wu, Jianhua, Li, Lei, Wang, Yiting, Ren, Xiaobin, Lin, Ken, He, Yongwen",2019,FEBS open bio,2

Since there is an underlying localizedinflammatory component in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, compounds liketocotrienol with anti-inflammatory properties may be able to retard itsprogression. This study aimed to determine the effects of oral tocotrienolsupplementation on the articular cartilage and subchondral bone in a rat model ofosteoarthritis induced by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA). Thirty maleSprague-Dawley rats (three-month-old) were randomized into five groups. Fourgroups were induced with osteoarthritis (single injection of MIA at week 0) andanother served as the sham group. Three of the four groups with osteoarthritiswere supplemented with annatto tocotrienol at 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg/day orallyfor five weeks. At week 5, all rats were sacrificed, and their tibial-femoraljoints were harvested for analysis. The results indicated that the groups whichreceived annatto tocotrienol at 100 and 150 mg/kg/day had lower histologicalscores and cartilage remodeling markers. Annatto tocotrienol at 150 mg/kg/daysignificantly lowered the osteocalcin levels and osteoclast surface ofsubchondral bone. In conclusion, annatto tocotrienol may potentially retard theprogression of osteoarthritis. Future studies to confirm its mechanism of jointprotection should be performed.","Chin, Kok-Yong, Wong, Sok Kuan, Japar Sidik, Fadhlullah Zuhair, Abdul Hamid, Juliana, Abas, Nurul Hafizah, Mohd Ramli, Elvy Suhana, Afian Mokhtar, Sabarul, Rajalingham, Sakthiswary, Ima Nirwana, Soelaiman",2019,International journal of environmental research and public health,2

In this paper, we demonstrate that Rg6 has a significantimmunosuppressive function on Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-induced systemicinflammatory responses. Rg6 was found to negatively regulate pro-inflammatoryresponses and severity in vivo, and thus induced recovery in mice withlipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock and cecal ligation and puncture(CLP)-induced sepsis. Rg6 treatment also facilitated recovery in mice withLPS-induced lung damage via reduced neutrophil infiltration and tumor necrosisfactor-α expression in lung tissues. Rg6 injection also downregulatedpro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of interleukin (IL)-10 in theserum of septic mice. Mechanistically, Rg6 did not induce TLR negativeregulators, such as A20 and IRAK-M, in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs).Instead, addition of Rg6 to LPS-activated BMDMs augmented IL-10 expression,whereas it inhibited inflammatory signaling, such as by nuclear factor κBactivation and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, Rg6 significantlyinduced miR-146a, an operator miRNA for anti-inflammation, in BMDMs.Collectively, these data indicate that Rg6 inhibits inflammatory responsesthrough the induction of IL-10 and miR-146a.","Paik, Seungwha, Choe, Jin Ho, Choi, Ga-Eun, Kim, Ji-Eun, Kim, Jin-Man, Song, Gyu Yong, Jo, Eun-Kyeong",2019,Scientific reports,2

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been shown to induce theupregulation of MMP-9 through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)oxidase (NOX)-reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent signaling pathways.N-(2-cyano-3,12-dioxo-28-noroleana-1,9(11)-dien-17-yl)-2-2-difluoropropanamide(RTA 408), a novel synthetic triterpenoid, has been shown to possess anti-oxidantand anti-inflammatory properties in various types of cells. Here, we evaluatedthe effects of RTA 408 on IL-1β-induced inflammatory responses by suppressingMMP-9 expression in a rat brain astrocyte (RBA-1) line. IL-1β-induced MMP-9protein and mRNA expression, and promoter activity were attenuated by RTA 408.The increased level of ROS generation in RBA-1 cells exposed to IL-1β wasattenuated by RTA 408, as determined by using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate (DCFH-DA) and CellROX. In addition, the inhibitory effects of RTA 408on MMP-9 expression resulted from the suppression of the IL-1β-stimulatedactivation of Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase), platelet-derived growth factorreceptor β (PDGFRβ), Akt, ROS, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).Pretreatment with RTA 408 attenuated the IL-1β-induced c-Jun phosphorylation,mRNA expression, and promoter activity. IL-1β-stimulated nuclear factor-κB(NF-κB) p65 phosphorylation, translocation, and promoter activity were alsoattenuated by RTA 408. Furthermore, IL-1β-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) protein and mRNA expression, and cell migration were attenuated bypretreatment with RTA 408. These results provide new insights into the mechanismsby which RTA 408 attenuates IL-1β-mediated inflammatory responses and exertsbeneficial effects for the management of brain diseases.","Yang, Chien-Chung, Lin, Chih-Chung, Jou, Mei-Jie, Hsiao, Li-Der, Yang, Chuen-Mao",2019,International journal of molecular sciences,2

Isosteviol Sodium (STV-Na) has shown promise as a neuroprotectiveagent in cerebral ischemia model, although its effect on microglial polarizationand chronic recovery after stroke is not clear. Here, we demonstrated that STV-Natreatment significantly reduced cerebral ischemic damage at both acute andchronic time points. STV-Na has a profound regulatory effect on microgliaresponse after stroke. It can promote M2 polarization and inhibitmicroglia-mediated inflammation (M1) response following stroke in vivo and invitro. Furthermore, we also found that Growth Arrest-Specific 5 (GAS5) alteredOGD/R-induced microglial activation by increasing Notch1 expression viamiR-146a-5p, the mRNA level of GAS5 and the protein level of Notch1 in vivo andin vitro, were discovered that both downgraded with STV-Na. Taken together, thepresent study demonstrated that STV-Na exerted neuroprotective effects bymodulating microglia/macrophage polarization in ischemic stroke via theGAS5/miR-146a-5p sponge. These findings provide new evidence that targetingSTV-Na could be a treatment for the prevention of stroke-related brain damage.","Zhang, Hao, Lu, Minyi, Zhang, Xiaofeng, Kuai, Yihe, Mei, Ying, Tan, Qiwen, Zhong, Kailun, Sun, Xiaoou, Tan, Wen",2019,Scientific reports,2

The present study aimed to evaluatethe effects of GRb1 on IIR injury and determine the mechanisms involved in theseeffects. Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to 75 min of superior mesentericartery occlusion, followed by 3 h of reperfusion. GRb1 (15 mg/kg) wasadministered intraperitoneally 1 h prior to the induction of IIR, with or withoutintravenous administration of Wortmannin [WM; a phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)inhibitor, 0.6 mg/kg]. The degree of intestinal injury and oxidativestress‑induced damage was determined by histopathologic evaluation andmeasurement of the serum activity levels of D‑lactate, diamine oxidase andendotoxin, and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD)and 8‑iso‑prostaglandin F2α (8‑iso‑PGF2α). The protein expression levels of p85,phosphorylated (p)‑p85, protein kinase B (Akt), p‑Akt and nuclear factorerythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2) were determined via western blotting, and theconcentrations of tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑6were measured via ELISA. It was revealed that IIR led to severe intestinal injury(as determined by significant increases in intestinal Chiu scores), which wasaccompanied with disruptions in the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier.IIR also increased the expression levels of TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑6, MDA and8‑iso‑PGF2α in the intestine, and decreased those of SOD. GRb1 reduced intestinalhistological injury, and suppressed inflammatory responses and oxidative stress.Additionally, the protective effects of GRb1 were eliminated by WM. Thesefindings indicated that GRb1 may ameliorate IIR injury by activating thePI3K/protein kinase B/Nrf2 pathway.","Chen, Sufang, Li, Xiang, Wang, Yanling, Mu, Panwei, Chen, Chaojin, Huang, Pinjie, Liu, Dezhao",2019,Molecular medicine reports,2
TA049083,10.3390/ijms20020360,Dual Role of Triptolide in Interrupting the NLRP3 Inflammasome Pathway toAttenuate Cardiac Fibrosis.,"In a previous paper, we reported that triptolide (TP), a commonly usedimmunomodulator, could attenuate cardiac hypertrophy. This present study aimed tofurther explore the inhibition of cardiac fibrosis by TP and the possiblemechanism from the perspective of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)inflammasome. Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's staining, immunohistochemistry, andimmunofluorescence were performed to observe cardiac fibrotic changes in mice andmouse cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). The Western blot, colocalization, andimmunoprecipitation were applied to detect protein expression and interactions.Results suggested that TP dose-dependently inhibited cardiac fibrosis induced byisoproterenol and collagen production of CFs induced by angiotensin II. TPexhibited an antifibrotic effect via inhibiting activation of the NLRP3inflammasome, which sequentially decreased IL-1β maturation, myeloiddifferentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-related phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminalkinase (JNK), extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), andTGF-β1/Smad signaling, and ultimately resulted in less collagen production.Moreover, TP showed no antifibrotic effect in Nlrp3-knockout CFs. Notably, TPinhibited the expression of NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like proteinscontaining a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) as well as inflammasome assembly,by interrupting the NLRP3-ASC interaction to inhibit inflammasome activation.Finally, TP indeed inhibited the NLRP3-TGFβ1-Smad pathway in vivo. Conclusively,TP was found to play a dual role in interrupting the activation of the NLRP3inflammasome to attenuate cardiac fibrosis.","Pan, Xi-Chun, Liu, Ya, Cen, Yan-Yan, Xiong, Ya-Lan, Li, Jing-Mei, Ding, Yuan-Yuan, Tong, Yang-Fei, Liu, Tao, Chen, Xiao-Hong, Zhang, Hai-Gang",2019,International journal of molecular sciences,2

Based on their structures, ginsenosides canbe divided into ginseng diol-type A and ginseng triol-type B with differentpharmacological effects. In this study, six ginsenosides, namely ginsenoside Rb1,Rh2, Rg3, Rg5 as diol-type ginseng saponins, and Rg1 and Re as triol-type ginsengsaponins, which were reported to be effective for ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)treatment, were chosen to compare their protective effects on cerebral I/Rinjury, and their mechanisms were studied by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Itwas found that all ginsenosides could reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS),inhibit apoptosis and increase mitochondrial membrane potential in cobaltchloride-induced (CoCl₂-induced) PC12 cells injury model, and they could reducecerebral infarction volume, brain neurological dysfunction of I/R rats in vivo.The results of immunohistochemistry and western blot showed that the expressionof Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88),silencing information regulator (SIRT1) and nuclear transcription factor P65(NF-κB) in hippocampal CA1 region of some ginsenoside groups were also reduced.In general, the effect on cerebral ischemia of Rb1 and Rg3 was significantlyimproved compared with the control group, and was the strongest among all theginsenosides. The effect on SIRT1 activation of ginsenoside Rb1 and theinhibition effect of TLR4/MyD88 protein expression of ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg3were significantly stronger than that of other groups. The results indicated thatginsenoside Rg1, Rb1, Rh2, Rg3, Rg5 and Re were effective in protecting the brainagainst ischemic injury, and ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg3 have the strongesttherapeutic activities in all the tested ginsenosides. Their neuroprotectivemechanism is associated with TLR4/MyD88 and SIRT1 activation signaling pathways,and they can reduce cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting NF-κB transcriptionalactivity and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, includinginterleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).","Cheng, Zhekang, Zhang, Meng, Ling, Chengli, Zhu, Ying, Ren, Hongwei, Hong, Chao, Qin, Jing, Liu, Tongxiang, Wang, Jianxin",2019,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2

It is advantageous over step-by-step synthesis, as itsimplifies the process, reduces costs and often leads to higher yield due to thesynergistic effects of enzymatic reactions. In this study, dihydroartemisinicacid (DHAA) pathway enzymes were overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, andwhole-cell biotransformation of amorpha-4,11-diene (AD) to DHAA was demonstrated.The first oxidation step by cytochrome P450 (CYP71AV1) is the main rate-limitingstep, and a series of N-terminal truncation and transcriptional tuning improvedthe enzymatic activity. With the co-expression of artemisinic aldehydedehydrogenase (ALDH1), which recycles NADPH, a significant 8-fold enhancement ofDHAA production was observed. Subsequently, abiotic conditions were optimized tofurther enhance the productivity of the whole-cell biocatalysts. Collectively,approximately 230 mg/L DHAA was produced by the multi-step whole-cell reaction, a~50% conversion from AD. This study illustrates the feasibility of producingbioactive compounds by in vitro one-pot multienzyme reactions.","Chen, Xixian, Zhang, Congqiang, Too, Heng-Phon",2017,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA049191,10.1093/jisesa/iex097,"Identification of the Alarm Pheromone of Cowpea Aphid, and Comparison With TwoOther Aphididae Species.","In response to a predator attack, many Aphidinae species release an alarmpheromone, which induces dispersal behavior in other individuals within thecolony. The major component of this pheromone is the sesquiterpene(E)-β-farnesene (Eβf), but variations occur between aphid species. In the presentwork, we collected, identified, and quantified the alarm pheromone of Aphiscraccivora Koch (Hemiptera: Aphididae), before quantifying the escape behaviorinduced in the neighboring individuals. We compared the semiochemistry andassociated behavior of alarm signaling with two other aphid species: Myzuspersicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and Aphis fabae Scopoli (Hemiptera:Aphididae). Eβf was the only volatile found for each species. M. persicaeproduces a higher quantity of Eβf (8.39 ± 1.19 ng per individual) than A.craccivora (6.02 ± 0.82 ng per individual) and A. fabae (2.04 ± 0.33 ng perindividual). Following exposure to natural doses of synthetic Eβf (50 ng and 500ng), A. craccivora respond more strongly than the two other Aphidinae specieswith 78% of the individuals initiated alarm behavior for 500 ng of Eβf.","Bayendi Loudit, Sandrine Mariella, Boullis, Antoine, Verheggen, François, Francis, Frédéric",2018,Journal of insect science (Online),2
TA049194,10.3390/molecules22071039,Enhanced Antibacterial Activity of Ent-Labdane Derivatives of Salvic Acid(7α-Hydroxy-8(17)-ent-Labden-15-Oic Acid): Effect of Lipophilicity and theHydrogen Bonding Role in Bacterial Membrane Interaction.,"In the present study, the antibacterial activity of several ent-labdanederivatives of salvic acid (7α-hydroxy-8(17)-ent-labden-15-oic acid) wasevaluated in vitro against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and theGram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. For all of thecompounds, the antibacterial activity was expressed as the minimum inhibitoryconcentration (MIC) in liquid media and minimum inhibitory amount (MIA) in solidmedia. Structure activity relationships (SAR) were employed to correlate theeffect of the calculated lipophilicity parameters (logP(ow)) on the inhibitoryactivity. Employing a phospholipidic bilayer (POPG) as a bacterial membranemodel, ent-labdane-membrane interactions were simulated utilizing dockingstudies. The results indicate that (i) the presence of a carboxylic acid in theC-15 position, which acted as a hydrogen-bond donor (HBD), was essential for theantibacterial activity of the ent-labdanes; (ii) an increase in the length of theacylated chain at the C-7 position improved the antibacterial activity until anoptimum length of five carbon atoms was reached; (iii) an increase in the lengthof the acylated chain by more than five carbon atoms resulted in a dramaticdecrease in activity, which completely disappeared in acyl chains of more thannine carbon atoms; and (iv) the structural factors described above, including oneHBD at C-15 and a hexanoyloxi moiety at C-7, had a good fit to a specificlipophilic range and antibacterial activity. The lipophilicity parameter has apredictive characteristic feature on the antibacterial activity of this class ofcompounds, to be considered in the design of new biologically active molecules.","Echeverría, Javier, Urzúa, Alejandro, Sanhueza, Loreto, Wilkens, Marcela",2017,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2
TA049198,10.1186/s12934-018-0984-x,Engineering the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce the aromacompound β-ionone.,"BACKGROUND: β-Ionone is a fragrant terpenoid that generates a pleasant floralscent and is used in diverse applications as a cosmetic and flavoring ingredient.A growing consumer desire for natural products has increased the market demandfor natural β-ionone. To date, chemical extraction from plants remains the mainapproach for commercial natural β-ionone production. Unfortunately, changingclimate and geopolitical issues can cause instability in the β-ionone supplychain. Microbial fermentation using generally recognized as safe (GRAS) yeastoffers an alternative method for producing natural β-ionone. Yarrowia lipolyticais an attractive host due to its oleaginous nature, established genetic tools,and large intercellular pool size of acetyl-CoA (the terpenoid backboneprecursor). RESULTS: A push-pull strategy via genome engineering was applied to aY. lipolytica PO1f derived strain. Heterologous and native genes in themevalonate pathway were overexpressed to push production to the terpenoidbackbone geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, while the carB and biofunction carRP genesfrom Mucor circinelloides were introduced to pull flux towards β-carotene (i.e.,ionone precursor). Medium tests combined with machine learning based dataanalysis and (13)C metabolite labeling investigated influential nutrients for theβ-carotene strain that achieved > 2.5 g/L β-carotene in a rich medium. Furtherintroduction of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (CCD1) from Osmanthusfragrans resulted in the β-ionone production. Utilization of in situ dodecanetrapping avoided ionone loss from vaporization (with recovery efficiencies of~ 76%) during fermentation operations, which resulted in titers of 68 mg/Lβ-ionone in shaking flasks and 380 mg/L in a 2 L fermenter. Both β-carotenemedium tests and β-ionone fermentation outcomes indicated the last enzymatic stepCCD1 (rather than acetyl-CoA supply) as the key bottleneck. CONCLUSIONS: Weengineered a GRAS Y. lipolytica platform for sustainable and economicalproduction of the natural aroma β-ionone. Although β-carotene could be producedat high titers by Y. lipolytica, the synthesis of β-ionone was relatively poor,possibly due to low CCD1 activity and non-specific CCD1 cleavage of β-carotene.In addition, both β-carotene and β-ionone strains showed decreased performancesafter successive sub-cultures. For industrial application, β-ionone fermentationefforts should focus on both CCD enzyme engineering and strain stabilityimprovement.","Czajka, Jeffrey J, Nathenson, Justin A, Benites, Veronica T, Baidoo, Edward E K, Cheng, Qianshun, Wang, Yechun, Tang, Yinjie J",2018,Microbial cell factories,2

Meyer) is one of the best-selling herbal medicines,with ginsenosides as its main pharmacologically active constituents. Althoughextensive chemical and pharmaceutical studies of these compounds have beenperformed, genome-wide studies of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptionfactors of ginseng are still limited. The bHLH transcription factor family is oneof the largest transcription factor families found in eukaryotic organisms, andthese proteins are involved in a myriad of regulatory processes. In our study,169 bHLH transcription factor genes were identified in the genome of P. ginseng,and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these PGbHLHs could be classified into24 subfamilies. A total of 21 RNA-seq data sets, including two sequencinglibraries for jasmonate (JA)-responsive and 19 reported libraries fororgan-specific expression analyses were constructed. Through a combination ofgene-specific expression patterns and chemical contents, 6 PGbHLH genes from 4subfamilies were revealed to be potentially involved in the regulation ofginsenoside biosynthesis. These 6 PGbHLHs, which had distinct target genes, werefurther divided into two groups depending on the absence of MYC-N structure. Ourresults would provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis andregulatory mechanisms of bHLH transcription factor action in P. ginseng.","Chu, Yang, Xiao, Shuiming, Su, He, Liao, Baosheng, Zhang, Jingjing, Xu, Jiang, Chen, Shilin",2018,Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

TA049270,10.1177/2156587217714145,A Survey on Chemical Constituents and Indications of Aromatic Waters Soft Drinks(Hydrosols) Used in Persian Nutrition Culture and Folk Medicine for NeurologicalDisorders and Mental Health.,"In Persian nutrition culture, drinking aromatic waters (hydrosols, distillate)has a long history as functional beverages or therapeutic remedies. Theco-distilled water with essential oils, which contains partial amounts of morewater-soluble volatile compounds are diluted and used as beverages. Since thesolubility of volatile components is different in water, the overall composition,and thus the biological activities of aromatic waters seem to be different fromthe essential oils they were co-distilled with. Despite the essential oils,chemical constituents of many aromatic waters have not been evaluatedscientifically. This research investigated hydrosols used for mental andneurological health maintenance in Persian nutrition culture and their chemicalconstituents. Constitutions of these hydrosols were extracted by liquid/liquidextraction method and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Furthermore, cluster analysis was used to evaluate the relevance of thesehydrosols chemical constituents. About 93 compounds were identified from 20aromatic waters. the major or second major constituents were thymol (azarolhowthorn, frankincense, lemon balm, valerian, shadab), phenethyl alcohol (damaskrose, dog-rose, starflower), carvacrol (basil, creeping buttercup, lemon balm);eugenol (shadab, dog-rose, starflower, basil), camphor (yarrow and wormwood),carvone (oriental plane), caryophyllene (cuminum), cinnamaldehyde (Chinesecinnamon), p-cymen-7-ol (musk willow), limonene (lemon verbena), linalool andα-terpineol (bitter orange), menthol (date palm) and methyl 5-vinylnicotinate(olive). Although, these hydrosols prepared from plants belong to different genusand families, but cluster analysis showed obvious similarities between theirchemical constituents. Results of this investigation showed in many cases thatthe constituents of aromatic waters are different from the pure essential oil.","Hamedi, Azadeh, Pasdaran, Ardalan, Zebarjad, Zahra, Moein, Mahmoodreza",2017,Journal of evidence-based complementary & alternative medicine,2

In this vein, the lipophilic fraction of short-term (three weeks)cultivated Bifurcaria bifurcata was characterized in detail by gaschromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). B. bifurcata dichloromethane extractwas composed mainly by diterpenes (1892.78 ± 133.97 mg kg(-1) dry weight (DW)),followed by fatty acids, both saturated (550.35 ± 15.67 mg kg(-1) DW) andunsaturated (397.06 ± 18.44 mg kg(-1) DW). Considerable amounts of sterols,namely fucosterol (317.68 ± 26.11 mg kg(-1) DW) were also found. In vitro testsdemonstrated that the B. bifurcata lipophilic extract show antioxidant,anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities (against both Gram-positive andGram-negative bacteria), using low extract concentrations (in the order of µgmL(-1)). Enhancement of antibiotic activity of drug families of major clinicalimportance was observed by the use of B. bifurcata extract. This enhancement ofantibiotic activity depends on the microbial strain and on the antibiotic.

TA049290,10.12688/f1000research.15445.2,Comparison of the oxidative potential of primary (POA) and secondary (SOA)organic aerosols derived from α-pinene and gasoline engine exhaust precursors.,"Background: Primary (POA) and secondary (SOA) organic aerosols, deriving fromboth anthropogenic and biogenic sources, represent a major fraction of ambientparticulate matter (PM) and play an important role in the etiology of respiratoryand cardiovascular diseases, largely through systemic inflammation and cellularoxidative stress. The relative contributions of these species to the inhalationburden, however, are rather poorly characterized. In this study, we measured thein vitro oxidative stress response of alveolar macrophages exposed to primary andsecondary PM derived from both anthropogenic and biogenic sources. Methods: POAand SOA were generated within an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) fed by pure,aerosolized α-pinene or gasoline engine exhaust, as representative emissions ofbiogenic and anthropogenic sources, respectively. The OFR utilized an ultraviolet(UV) lamp to achieve an equivalent atmospheric aging process of several days.Results: Anthropogenic SOA produced the greatest oxidative response (1900 ± 255µg-Zymosan/mg-PM), followed by biogenic (α-pinene) SOA (1321 ± 542µg-Zymosan/mg-PM), while anthropogenic POA produced the smallest response (51.4 ±64.3 µg-Zymosan/mg-PM). Conclusions: These findings emphasize the importance ofmonitoring and controlling anthropogenic emissions in the urban atmosphere, whilealso taking into consideration spatial and seasonal differences in SOAcomposition. Local concentrations of biogenic and anthropogenic speciescontributing to the oxidative potential of ambient PM may vary widely, dependingon the given region and time of year, due to factors such as surroundingvegetation, proximity to urban areas, and hours of daylight.","Lovett, Christopher, Baasiri, Mohamad, Atwi, Khairallah, Sowlat, Mohammad H, Shirmohammadi, Farimah, Shihadeh, Alan L, Sioutas, Constantinos",2018,F1000Research,2

Previous research has not systematicallyreported the correlation between changes in key enzyme activity with changes inginsenoside content in fresh ginseng over time. In this study, for the firsttime, we use ginseng samples of varying ages in Ji'an and systematically reportedthe changes in the activity of seven key enzymes (HMGR, FPS, SS, SE, DS, CYP450,and GT). We investigated the content of ginsenoside and gene expression of thesekey enzymes. Ginsenoside content was measured using HPLC. HPLC, GC-MS, and LC-MSwere combined to measure the enzyme activity of the key enzymes. Quantitative PCRwas used in the investigation of gene expression. By analyzing the correlationbetween the enzyme activity and the transcription level of the key enzymes withginsenoside content, we found that DS and GT enzyme activities are significantlycorrelated with the ginsenoside content in different ages of ginseng.

Thisstudy aims to study the anticancer action of the combination treatment of DHA/ARSand farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), a Ras inhibitor, in HCC cells (Huh-7 andHepG2 cell lines). FTS pretreatment significantly enhanced DHA/ARS-inducedphosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, Bak/Bax activation, mitochondrialmembrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase-8 and -9 activations,characteristics of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis. Pretreatment withZ-IETD-FMK (caspase-8 inhibitor) potently prevented the cytotoxicity of thecombination treatment of DHA/ARS and FTS, and pretreatment with Z-VAD-FMK(pan-caspase inhibitor) significantly inhibited the loss of ΔΨm induced byDHA/ARS treatment or the combination treatment of DHA/ARS and FTS in HCC cells.Furthermore, silencing Bak/Bax modestly but significantly inhibited thecytotoxicity of the combination treatment of DHA/ARS and FTS. Interestingly,pretreatment with an antioxidant N-Acetyle-Cysteine (NAC) significantly preventedthe cytotoxicity of the combination treatment of DHA and FTS instead of thecombination treatment of ARS and FTS, suggesting that reactive oxygen species(ROS) played a key role in the anticancer action of the combination treatment ofDHA and FTS. Similar to FTS, DHA/ARS also significantly prevented Ras activation.Collectively, our data demonstrate that FTS potently sensitizes Huh-7 and HepG2cells to artemisinin derivatives via accelerating the extrinsic and intrinsicapoptotic pathways.","Wu, Liping, Pang, Yilin, Qin, Guiqi, Xi, Gaina, Wu, Shengnan, Wang, Xiaoping, Chen, Tongsheng",2017,PloS one,2

Mutations in the genes encoding the proteins of the retinoid cycleare the leading cause for recessively inherited retinal dystrophies such asretinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, congenital cone-rod dystrophyand fundus albipunctatus. Currently there is no treatment for these blindingdiseases. In previous studies we demonstrated that oral treatment with the9-cis-β-carotene rich Dunaliella Bardawil algae powder significantly improvedvisual and retinal functions in patients with retinitis pigmentosa and fundusalbipunctatus. Here we developed a convenient and economical synthetic route forbiologically active 9-cis-β-carotene from inexpensive building materials anddemonstrated that the molecule is stable for at least one month. Synthetic9-cis-β-carotene rescued cone photoreceptors from degeneration in eye cupcultures of mice with a retinoid cycle genetic defect. This study suggests thatsynthetic 9-cis-β-carotene may serve as an effective treatment for retinaldystrophies involving the retinoid cycle.","Sher, Ifat, Tzameret, Adi, Peri-Chen, Sara, Edelshtain, Victoria, Ioffe, Michael, Sayer, Alon, Buzhansky, Ludmila, Gazit, Ehud, Rotenstreich, Ygal",2018,Scientific reports,2

Oligonucleotide microarrayprofiling revealed that UR is an effective regulator of the liver transcriptome,and canonical pathways associated with the ""circadian rhythm"" and ""extracellularmatrix (ECM)⁻receptor interactions"" were effectively regulated by UR in theliver. UR altered the expression of various clock and clock-controlled genes(CCGs), which may be linked to the improvement of hepatic steatosis and fibrosisvia lipid metabolism control and detoxification enhancement. UR reduced excessivereactive oxygen species production, adipokine/cytokine dysregulation, and ECMaccumulation in the liver, which also contributed to improve hepatic lipotoxicityand fibrosis. Moreover, UR improved pancreatic islet dysfunction, and suppressedhepatic gluconeogenesis, thereby reducing obesity-associated insulin resistance.Therapeutic approaches targeting hepatic circadian clock and CCGs using UR mayameliorate the deleterious effects of diet-induced obesity and associatedcomplications such as hepatic fibrosis.","Kwon, Eun-Young, Shin, Su-Kyung, Choi, Myung-Sook",2018,Nutrients,2

TA049996,10.18632/oncotarget.13836,Structurally related odorant ligands of the olfactory receptor OR51E2differentially promote metastasis emergence and tumor growth.,"Olfactory receptors are G protein-coupled receptors. Some of them are expressedin tumor cells, such as the OR51E2 receptor overexpressed in LNCaP prostatecancer cells. It is considered a prostate tumor marker. We previouslydemonstrated that this receptor is able to promote LNCaP cell invasiveness invitro upon stimulation with its odorant agonist β-ionone, leading to increasedgeneration of metastases in vivo. In the present study, we show that even arelatively short exposure to β-ionone is sufficient to promote metastasisemergence. Moreover, α-ionone, considered an OR51E2 antagonist, in fact promotesprostate tumor growth in vivo. The combination of α-ionone with β-ionone triggersa higher increase in the total tumor burden than each molecule alone. To supportthe in vivo results, we demonstrate in vitro that α-ionone is a real agonist ofOR51E2, mainly sustaining LNCaP cell growth, while β-ionone mainly promotes cellinvasiveness. So, while structurally close, α-ionone and β-ionone appear toinduce different cellular effects, both leading to increased tumoraggressiveness. This behaviour could be explained by a different coupling todownstream effectors, as it has been reported for the so-called biased ligands ofother G protein-coupled receptors.","Sanz, Guenhaël, Leray, Isabelle, Grébert, Denise, Antoine, Sharmilee, Acquistapace, Adrien, Muscat, Adeline, Boukadiri, Abdelhak, Mir, Lluis M",2017,Oncotarget,2
TA050081,10.1155/2018/2548378,α-Hederin Arrests Cell Cycle at G2/M Checkpoint and Promotes MitochondrialApoptosis by Blocking Nuclear Factor-κB Signaling in Colon Cancer Cells.,"Colon cancer represents the third most common malignancy worldwide. New drugswith high efficaciousness and safety for the treatment of colon cancer areurgently needed in clinical context. Here, we were aimed to evaluate theantitumor activity of the natural compound α-hederin in human colon cancer cells.We treated SW620 cells with interleukin-6 (IL-6) in vitro to mimic the paracrineinflammatory microenvironment of tumor cells. α-Hederin concentration dependentlyreduced the viability of IL-6-stimulated SW620 cells. α-Hederin increased thenumber of IL-6-stimulated SW620 cells at the G2/M phase and reduced the mRNA andprotein expression of cyclin B1 and CDK1. Moreover, α-hederin induced apoptosisand loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in IL-6-stimulated SW620 cells.α-Hederin downregulated Bcl-2 expression, upregulated Bax expression, andpromoted cytochrome c release from mitochondria into cytoplasm. Additionally,α-hederin elevated the levels of cleaved-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-3, andcleaved-PARP, but had little effects on the levels of cleaved-caspase-8.Moreover, α-hederin prevented the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB(NF-κB) and reduced the phosphorylation of IκBα and IKKα, suggesting the blockadeof NF-κB signaling. NF-κB inhibitor PDTC not only produced similar proapoptoticeffects on IL-6-stimulated SW620 cells as α-hederin did, but also synergisticallyenhanced α-hederin's proapoptotic effects. Furthermore, α-hederin inhibited thephosphorylation of ERK in IL-6-stimulated SW620 cells, which was involved inα-hederin blockade of NF-κB nuclear translocation. Altogether, α-hederinsuppressed viability, induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, and stimulatedmitochondrial and caspase-dependent apoptosis in colon cancer cells, which wereassociated with disruption of NF-κB and ERK pathways, suggesting α-hederin as apromising candidate for intervention of colon cancer.","Sun, Dongdong, Shen, Weixing, Zhang, Feng, Fan, Huisen, Tan, Jiani, Li, Liu, Xu, Changliang, Zhang, Haibin, Yang, Ye, Cheng, Haibo",2018,BioMed research international,2
TA050120,10.3389/fcimb.2018.00293,Attenuation of Listeria monocytogenes Virulence by Cannabis sativa L. EssentialOil.,"Anti-virulence strategies are being explored as a novel approach to combatpathogens. Such strategies include inhibition of surface adhesion, tissueinvasion, toxin production, and/or interference with the gene regulation of othervirulence traits. Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, isa facultative intracellular food pathogen characterized by a wide distribution inthe environment. Its ability to persist within biofilms and to develop resistanceto sanitizers is the cause of significant problems in food processing plants andof steep costs for the food industry. In humans, the treatment of listeriosis ishampered by the intracellular location of listeriae and the poor intracellularpenetration of some antibiotics. Eleven L. monocytogenes isolates from patientswho were diagnosed with invasive listeriosis in Italy in 2014-2016 were studied.This in vitro and in vivo study explored the antibacterial and anti-virulenceproperties of a steam-distilled essential oil of Cannabis sativa L., which isbeing intensively investigated for its high content in powerful bioactivephytochemicals. Susceptibility experiments demonstrated a moderate bactericidalactivity of the essential oil (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration > 2048 μg/mL).Assessment of the effects of sublethal concentrations of the essential oil on L.monocytogenes virulence traits demonstrated a significant action on motility.Listeriae were non-motile after exposure to the essential oil. Light and scanningelectron microscopy documented aggregates of listeriae with the flagella trappedinside the cluster. Real-time RT-PCR experiments showed downregulation offlagellar motility genes and of the regulatory gene prfA. The ability to formbiofilm and to invade Caco-2 cells was also significantly reduced. Galleriamellonella larvae infected with L. monocytogenes grown in presence of sublethalconcentrations of the essential oil showed much higher survival rates comparedwith controls, suggesting that the extract inhibited tissue invasion. Foodcontamination with L. monocytogenes is a major concern for the food industry,particularly for plants making ready-to-eat and processed food. The present workprovides a baseline in the study of the anti-virulence properties of the C.sativa essential oil against L. monocytogenes. Further studies are needed tounderstand if it could be used as an alternative agent for the control of L.monocytogenes in food processing plants.","Marini, Emanuela, Magi, Gloria, Ferretti, Gianna, Bacchetti, Tiziana, Giuliani, Angelica, Pugnaloni, Armanda, Rippo, Maria Rita, Facinelli, Bruna",2018,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2

The response surface methodology (RSM) tool helps to accuratelyanalyze the most suitable conditions to maximize C50 carotenoids production byhaloarchaea. The effects of temperature (15⁻50 °C), pH (4-10), and salinity(5⁻28% NaCl (w/v)) on the growth and carotenoid content of H. mediterranei wereanalyzed using the RSM approach. Growth was determined by measuring the turbidityat 600 nm. To determine the carotenoid content, harvested cells were lysed byfreeze/thawing, then re-suspended in acetone and the total carotenoid contentdetermined by measuring the absorbance at 494 nm. The analysis of carotenoids wasperformed by an HPLC system coupled with mass spectrometry. The results indicatedthe theoretical optimal conditions of 36.51 or 36.81 °C, pH of 8.20 or 8.96, and15.01% or 12.03% (w/v) salinity for the growth of haloarchaea (OD600 = 12.5 ±0.64) and production of total carotenoids (3.34 ± 0.29 mg/L), respectively. Theseconditions were validated experimentally for growth (OD600 = 13.72 ± 0.98) andcarotenoid production (3.74 ± 0.20 mg/L). The carotenoid profile showed fourisomers of bacterioruberin (89.13%).

The role of l-arginine-NO-cGMP-K⁺ was assessedby the von Frey and the Randall-Selitto tests. Both allodynia and hyperalgesiaassessments were carried out on the 14th day post CCI, 30 min after treatmentswere given for each respective pathway. Anti-allodynic and antihyperalgesiceffects of zerumbone (10 mg/kg, i.p) were significantly reversed by thepre-treatment of l-arginine (10 mg/kg), 1H[1,2,4]Oxadiazole[4,3a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a soluble guanosyl cyclase blocker(2 mg/kg i.p.) and glibenclamide (ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker) (10mg/kg i.p.) (p < 0.05).

Several routes of intermediates, depending on the sequence ofaction of these enzymes, lead to the formation of astaxanthin. In the presentstudy, the enzyme activities of 3, 3' β-carotene hydroxylase (CRTZ) and 4, 4'β-carotene oxygenase (CRTW) have been combined through the creation of ""new tonature"" enzyme fusions in order to overcome leakage of non-endogenousintermediates and pleotropic effects associated with their high levels in plants.The utility of flexible linker sequences of varying size has been assessed in theconstruction of pZ-W enzyme fusions. Frist, in vivo color complementation assaysin Escherichia coli have been used to evaluate the potential of the fusionenzymes. Analysis of the carotenoid pigments present in strains generatedindicated that the enzyme fusions only possess both catalytic activities whenCRTZ is attached as the N-terminal module. Astaxanthin levels in E. coli cellswere increased by 1.4-fold when the CRTZ and CRTW enzymes were fused compared tothe individual enzymes. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana was thenperformed in order to assess the potential of the fusions in a plant system. Theproduction of valuable ketocarotenoids was achieved using this plant-basedtransient expression system. This revealed that CRTZ and CRTW, transientlyexpressed as a fusion, accumulated similar levels of astaxanthin compared to theexpression of the individual enzymes whilst being associated with reducedketocarotenoid intermediate levels (e.g. phoenicoxanthin, canthaxanthin and3-OH-echinenone) and a reduced rate of leaf senescence after transformation.Therefore, the quality of the plant material producing the ketocarotenoids wasenhanced due to a reduction in the stress induced by the accumulation of highlevels of heterologous ketocarotenoid intermediates. The size of the linkersappeared to have no effect upon activity. The potential of the approach toproduction of valuable plant derived products is discussed.","Nogueira, Marilise, Enfissi, Eugenia M A, Welsch, Ralf, Beyer, Peter, Zurbriggen, Matias D, Fraser, Paul D",2019,Metabolic engineering,2
TA050317,10.1002/cam4.1127,The mTOR inhibition in concurrence with ERK1/2 activation is involved inexcessive autophagy induced by glycyrrhizin in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Autophagy is a life phenomenon in which autophagosomes remove damaged or agingorganelles and long-lived circulating proteins to maintain the cell's stability.However, disorders of excessive autophagy are a response of cancer cells to avariety of anticancer treatments which lead to cancer cell death. TheAkt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the extracellular signal-regulatedkinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways are both involved in nutrient-induced autophagicphenomenon and exhibit vital relevance to oncogenesis in various cancer celltypes, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the influence ofautophagy for cancer cell death remains controversial and few scientists haveinvestigated the variation of these two signaling pathways in cancer cellautophagic phenomenon induced by anticancer treatment simultaneously. Here, weexplored the anticancer efficacy and mechanisms of glycyrrhizin (GL), a bioactivecompound of licorice with little toxicity in normal cells. It is interesting thatinhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling in concurrence with enhanced ERK1/2 activityexists in GL-induced autophagy and cytotoxicity in HepG2 and MHCC97-Hhepatocellular carcinoma cells. These results imply that the GL-relatedanticancer ability might correlate with the induction of autophagy. The influenceof induced autophagic phenomenon on cell viability might depend on the severityof autophagy and be pathway specific. In the subsequent subcutaneous xenograftexperiment in vivo with MHCC97-H cells, GL obviously exhibited its inhibitoryefficacy in tumor growth via inducing excess autophagy in MHCC97-H cells(P < 0.05).

However, the role of ASTon chondrocyte apoptosis and its underlying mechanism remains unknown. In thepresent study, degenerative chondrocytes isolated from patients withosteoarthritis (OA) were subjected to AST and IL‑1β treatment. Results indicatedthat AST protected against chondrocyte apoptosis induced by IL‑1β. Westernblotting indicated that AST increased the protein expression of LC3‑II/I anddecreased P62/SQSTM1 expression, which suggested that AST upregulated autophagyactivity in chondrocytes. Fluorescent protein GFP‑LC3 analysis and transmissionelectron microscopy observation confirmed that autophagy was promoted by AST. Incontrast, after autophagy inhibited by 3‑methyladenine, chondrocyte apoptosis wasfurther increased under IL‑1β treatment.

TA050360,10.2147/IJN.S127549,Iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles combined with actein suppress non-small-celllung cancer growth in a p53-dependent manner.,"Actein (AT) is a triterpene glycoside isolated from the rhizomes of Cimicifugafoetida that has been investigated for its antitumor effects. AT treatment leadsto apoptosis in various cell types, including breast cancer cells, by regulatingdifferent signaling pathways. Iron oxide (Fe(3)O(4)) magnetic nanoparticles(MNPs) are nanomaterials with biocompatible activity and low toxicity. In thepresent study, the possible benefits of AT in combination with MNPs onnon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were explored in in vitro and in vivo studies.AT-MNP treatment contributed to apoptosis in NSCLC cells, as evidenced byactivation of the caspase 3-signaling pathway, which was accompanied bydownregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl2 and BclXL, and upregulation ofthe proapoptotic signals Bax and Bad. The death receptors of TRAIL were alsoelevated following AT-MNP treatment in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, amouse xenograft model in vivo revealed that AT-MNP treatment exhibited notoxicity and suppressed NSCLC growth compared to either AT or MNP monotherapies.In conclusion, this study suggests a novel therapy to induce apoptosis insuppressing NSCLC growth in a p53-dependent manner by combining AT with Fe(3)O(4)MNPs.","Wang, Ming-Shan, Chen, Liang, Xiong, Ya-Qiong, Xu, Jing, Wang, Ji-Peng, Meng, Zi-Li",2017,International journal of nanomedicine,2

The dilationresponses of the cerebral pial artery to hypercapnia and hypotension wereassessed in rats before and 1 h after ischemia. The ischemia reperfusion (IR)control group received DMSO (1 µL/kg) immediately after ischemia. Two differentdoses of salvinorin A (10 and 20 µg/kg) were administered following the onset ofreperfusion. The 5th, 6th, and 7th groups received salvinorin A (20 µg/kg) andLY294002 (10 µM), L-NAME (10 μM), or norbinaltorphimine (norBIN, 1 μM) afterischemia. The levels of cGMP in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were also measured.The phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) was measured in the cerebral cortex by westernblot at 24 h post-ischemia. Cell necrosis and apoptosis were examined byhematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) and TUNEL staining, respectively. The motorfunction of the rats was evaluated at 1, 2, and 5 days post-ischemia. Thedilation responses of the cerebral pial artery were significantly impaired afterischemia and were preserved by salvinorin A treatment. In addition, salvinorin Asignificantly increased the levels of cGMP and p-AKT, suppressed cell necrosisand apoptosis of the cerebral cortex and improved the motor function of the rats.These effects were abolished by LY294002, L-NAME, and norBIN.

In the current study,the anti-inflammatory effects and action mechanisms of alisol F and25-anhydroalisol F were investigated in vitro. Moreover, the pharmacologicaleffects of alisol F in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/d-galactosamine (d-gal)-inducedacute liver-injured mice were evaluated. The results demonstrated that alisol Fand 25-anhydroalisol F could suppress LPS-induced production of nitric oxide(NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), andinterleukin-1β (IL-1β), as well as inhibit the mRNA and protein levels ofinducible nitric oxide (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In addition, weinvestigated the role of alisol F and 25-anhydroalisol F in mediatingmitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), signal transducers, and activators oftranscription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways involved in theinflammation process of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The phosphorylation ofERK, JNK, p38, and STAT3, and the NF-κB signaling pathway, were obviouslysuppressed in alisol F and 25-anhydroalisol F treated cells. Results obtainedfrom in vitro experiments suggested alisol F obviously improved liverpathological injury by inhibiting the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, andsignificantly decreasing the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartateaminotransferase (AST) levels in LPS/d-gal-induced mice. Furthermore, thereduction of phosphorylation of ERK and JNK, as well as suppression of the NF-κBsignaling pathway, were also observed in liver tissues of the alisol F-treatedmice model.

TA050427,10.1186/s12896-018-0438-x,Cloning and characterization of enoate reductase with high β-ionone todihydro-β-ionone bioconversion productivity.,"BACKGROUND: Dihydro-β-ionone is a principal aroma compound and has receivedconsiderable attention by flavor and fragrance industry. The traditional methodof preparing dihydro-β-ionone has many drawbacks, which has restricted itsindustrial application. Therefore, it is necessary to find a biotechnologicalmethod to produce dihydro-β-ionone. RESULTS: In this study, the enoate reductasewith high conversion efficiency of β-ionone to dihydro-β-ionone, DBR1, wasobtained by screening four genetically engineered bacteria. The product,dihydro-β-ionone, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The highest dihydro-β-iononeproduction with 308.3 mg/L was detected in the recombinant strain expressing DBR1which was later on expressed and purified. Its optimal temperature and pH were45 °C and 6.5, respectively. The greatest activity of the purified enzyme was356.39 U/mg using β-ionone as substrate. In the enzymatic conversion system, 1 mMof β-ionone was transformed into 91.08 mg/L of dihydro-β-ionone with 93.80% ofmolar conversion. CONCLUSION: DBR1 had high selectivity to hydrogenated the10,11-unsaturated double bond of β-ionone as well as high catalytic efficiencyfor the conversion of β-ionone to dihydro-β-ionone. It is the first report on thebioconversion of β-ionone to dihydro-β-ionone by using enoate reductase.","Zhang, Xuesong, Liao, Shiyong, Cao, Fuliang, Zhao, Linguo, Pei, Jianjun, Tang, Feng",2018,BMC biotechnology,2
TA050429,10.1262/jrd.2017-042,Nrf2 inhibition affects cell cycle progression during early mouse embryodevelopment.,"Brusatol, a quassinoid isolated from the fruit of Bruceajavanica, has recentlybeen shown to inhibit nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) viaKeap1-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation or protein synthesis.Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates the cellular defense response. Moststudies have focused on the effects of Nrf2 in tumor development. Here, thecritical roles of Nrf2 in mouse early embryonic development were investigated. Wefound that brusatol treatment at the zygotic stage prevented the early embryodevelopment. Most embryos stayed at the two-cell stage after 5 days of culture (P< 0.05). This effect was associated with the cell cycle arrest, as the mRNA levelof CDK1 and cyclin B decreased at the two-cell stage after brusatol treatment.The embryo development potency was partially rescued by the injection of Nrf2CRISPR activation plasmid. Thus, brusatol inhibited early embryo development byaffecting Nrf2-related cell cycle transition from G(2) to M phase that isdependent on cyclin B-CDK1 complex.","Lin, Ying, Sui, Liu-Cai, Wu, Rong-Hua, Ma, Ru-Jun, Fu, Hai-Yan, Xu, Juan-Juan, Qiu, Xu-Hua, Chen, Li",2018,The Journal of reproduction and development,2

Experimental colitis model was established in rats by injecting2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) through anus. After 24 hours, ASIV wasadministrated once daily by gavage for 6 days. On day 1 and day 7, colon tissuewas collected for macroscopic and histological examination, ELISA, Western blotand immunohistochemical analysis. TNBS impaired colonic mucosa with an injuredepithelial architecture, increased inflammatory cell infiltration, and decreasedcolonic blood flow. Lgr5 positive cell number in crypt and β-catenin nucleartranslocation were down-regulated by TNBS treatment. TNBS induced epithelialF-actin disruption and junctional protein degradation. Furthermore, adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) content and ATP synthase subunit β expression in the colontissue were significantly decreased after TNBS stimulation. All of theaforementioned alterations were relieved by ASIV post-treatment. The presentstudy revealed that ASIV promoted mucosal healing process in TNBS-inducedcolitis, which was most likely attributed to regulating energy metabolism.","Jiang, Xu-Guang, Sun, Kai, Liu, Yu-Ying, Yan, Li, Wang, Ming-Xia, Fan, Jing-Yu, Mu, Hong-Na, Li, Chong, Chen, Yuan-Yuan, Wang, Chuan-She, Han, Jing-Yan",2017,Scientific reports,2
TA050496,10.1016/j.ijpddr.2017.05.002,Elimination of Schistosoma mansoni in infected mice by slow release ofartemisone.,"The current treatment of schistosomiasis is based on the anti-helminthic drugpraziquantel (PZQ). PZQ affects only the adult stages of schistosomes. Inaddition, resistance to PZQ is emerging. We suggest a drug, which could serve asa potential alternative or complement to PZQ, and as a means of treatinginfections at earlier, pre-granuloma stage. Derivatives of the peroxidicantimalarial drug artemisinin have been indicated as alternatives, because bothplasmodia and schistosomes are blood-feeding parasites. The mechanism of actionof artemisinins is related to oxidative effects of the artemisinins onintracellular reductants leading to formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygenspecies. We used artemisone, which has improved pharmacokinetics andanti-plasmodial activity, and reduced toxicity compared to other artemisinins inclinical use against malaria. We infected adult mice by subcutaneous injection ofS. mansoni cercariae (about 200) and treated them at various times post infectionby the following methods: i. artemisone suspension administered by gavage(400-450 mg/kg); ii. subcutaneous injection of a gel containing a knownconcentration of artemisone (115-120 mg/kg); iii. subcutaneous insertion of thedrug incorporated in a solid polymer (56-60 mg/kg); iv. intraperitoneal injectionof the drug solubilized in DMSO (115-120 mg/kg). Drug administration in polymerswas performed to enable slow release of the artemisone that was verified in vivoand in vitro bioassays using drug-sensitive malaria parasites. We found superiorstrong anti-schistosome effects up to a total reduction of worm number, mainlyfollowing repetitive treatments with the drug absorbed in the polymers (73.1% and95.9% reduction in mice treated with artemisone in gel 7 and 14, and 21, 28 and35 days post infection, respectively). The results indicate that artemisone has apotent anti-schistosome activity. Its main importance in this context is itseffectiveness in treating hosts harboring juvenile schistosomes, beforeegg-deposition and induction of deleterious immune responses.","Gold, Daniel, Alian, Mohammed, Domb, Avraham, Karawani, Yara, Jbarien, Maysa, Chollet, Jacques, Haynes, Richard K, Wong, Ho Ning, Buchholz, Viola, Greiner, Andreas, Golenser, Jacob",2017,International journal for parasitology.

TA050522,10.7150/thno.18788,Ginsenoside Rg1 Inhibits Glucagon-Induced Hepatic Gluconeogenesis throughAkt-FoxO1 Interaction.,"Rationale: Glucagon is involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis, playing a key role intype 2 diabetes. Ginsenosides are reported to have antidiabetic activities.Ginsenoside Rg1 is a major propanaxatriol-type saponin in ginseng. This studyaims to investigate the regulatory effects of Rg1 on glucagon-induced hepaticglucose production. Methods: The effects of Rg1 were investigated inhigh-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice and glucagon-challenged C57BL/6J mice. Glucosemetabolism was evaluated by oral glucose tolerance test and pyruvate tolerancetest. The role of Rg1 on the regulation of Akt-FoxO1 interaction was performedusing immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, siRNA silencing, pharmacologicalinhibitor and active-site mutant in primary hepatocytes or HepG2 cells. Results:Abnormally elevated fasting glucagon levels were observed in HFD-fed mice,contributing significantly to increased fasting plasma glucose levels.Inappropriate fasting glucagon secretion inactivated Akt and promoted hepaticglucose production via upregulation of FoxO1 activity. Rg1 preservedglucagon-impaired Akt activation partly by binding to Akt at Ser473 site. Rg1also promoted Akt binding to FoxO1 and inactivated FoxO1 by phosphorylation.Consequently, Rg1 decreased the hepatic glucose production through a decrease intranscription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Both siRNA silencing of Akt and Akt inhibitor triciribineattenuated the effects of Rg1 in response to fasting hormone glucagon.Conclusion: Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 by ginsenoside Rg1 is critical for itsgluconeogenesis-lowering effect, suggesting a potential for pharmaceuticalintervention in response to fasting hormone glucagon.","Liu, Qun, Zhang, Fei-Ge, Zhang, Wen-Song, Pan, An, Yang, Yi-Lin, Liu, Jin-Feng, Li, Ping, Liu, Bao-Lin, Qi, Lian-Wen",2017,Theranostics,2

Previous studies have found that iridoids in H. diffusa play animportant role in its anti-inflammatory activity. This study aimed to investigatethe anti-inflammatory effect and potential mechanism of five iridoids(asperuloside (ASP), asperulosidic acid (ASPA), desacetyl asperulosidic acid(DAA), scandoside methyl ester (SME), and E-6-O-p-coumaroyl scandoside methylester (CSME)) that are presented in H. diffusa using lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. ASP and ASPA significantly decreased theproduction of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in parallel with the inhibition of induciblenitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), TNF-α, and IL-6 mRNAexpression in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. ASP treatment suppressed thephosphorylation of the inhibitors of nuclear factor-kappaB alpha (IκB-α), p38,extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).The inhibitory effect of ASPA was similar to that of ASP, except for p38phosphorylation. In summary, the anti-inflammatory effects of ASP and ASPA arerelated to the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and mediators via suppressionof the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways,which provides scientific evidence for the potential application of H. diffusa.","He, Jingyu, Lu, Xianyuan, Wei, Ting, Dong, Yaqian, Cai, Zheng, Tang, Lan, Liu, Menghua",2018,International journal of molecular sciences,2

However, anti-cancer function and theunderlying mechanisms of demethylzeylasteral in melanoma cells remain unclear. Inthis study, we demonstrate that demethylzeylasteral has an anti-tumor property inmelanoma cells. Demethylzeylasteral not only inhibits cell proliferation throughcell cycle arrest at S phase, but also induces cell apoptosis in melanoma cells.MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic protein in BCL2 family, and amplifies frequently inmultiple human cancers. MCL1 is also known as a potential contributor for theresistance of BCL2 inhibitors, as well as various chemotherapeutic drugs. MCL1is, therefore, regarded as a potential target for cancer therapy. Here, for thefirst time, we unveil that demethylzeylasteral suppresses the expression of MCL1.Interestingly, MCL1 interacts with S phase-related protein CDK2, and therebyinhibits it's ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Together, demethylzeylasteral is apromising anti-tumor compound in melanoma cells. Demethylzeylasteral is also apotential inhibitor of MCL1.","Zhao, Yuzu, He, Jiang, Li, Jun, Peng, Xingzhi, Wang, Xianxing, Dong, Zhen, Zhao, Erhu, Liu, Yaling, Wu, Zonghui, Cui, Hongjuan",2017,Cell death & disease,2

However, to date, the biosynthetic pathway of its twoquality-control components, catalpol and acteoside, are only partially elucidatedand the mechanism for their tissue-specific accumulation remains unknown. Tofacilitate the basic understanding of the key genes and transcriptionalregulators involved in the biosynthesis of catalpol and acteoside, transcriptomesequencing of radial striation (RS) and non-radial striation (nRS) from four R.glutinosa cultivars was performed. A total of 715,158,202 (~107.27 Gb) highquality reads obtained using paired-end Illumina sequencing were de novoassembled into 150,405 transcripts. Functional annotation with multiple publicdatabases identified 155 and 223 unigenes involved in catalpol and acteosidebiosynthesis, together with 325 UGTs, and important transcription factor (TF)families. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomes identified 362 unigenes,found to be differentially expressed in all RS vs. nRS comparisons, with 143upregulated unigenes, including those encoding enzymes of the catalpol andacteoside biosynthetic pathway, such as geranyl diphosphate synthase (RgGPPS),geraniol 8-hydroxylase (RgG10H), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (RgPAL). Otherdifferentially expressed unigenes predicted to be related to catalpol andacteoside biosynthesis fall into UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs), aswell as transcription factors. In addition, 16 differentially expressed geneswere selectively confirmed by real-time PCR.

The development of novel therapies to enhance theatheroprotective properties of HDL may have the possibility of further reducingthe residual AS risk. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is believed to be aprimary atheroprotective activity of HDL, which has been shown to promote theefflux of excess cholesterol from macrophage-derived foam cells via ATP-bindingcassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), andscavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and then transport it back to the liverfor excretion into bile and eventually into the feces.

TA050956,10.1186/s42238-025-00268-w,CANDI: a web server for predicting molecular targets and pathways ofcannabis-based therapeutics.,"BACKGROUND: Cannabis sativa L. with a rich history of traditional medicinal use,has garnered significant attention in contemporary research for its potentialtherapeutic applications in various human diseases, including pain, inflammation,cancer, and osteoarthritis. However, the specific molecular targets andmechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of its diverse phytochemicalconstituents remain elusive. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial fordeveloping targeted, effective cannabis-based therapies. METHODS: To investigatethe molecular targets and pathways involved in the synergistic effects ofcannabis compounds, we utilized DRIFT, a deep learning model that leveragesattention-based neural networks to predict compound-target interactions. Weconsidered both whole plant extracts and specific plant-based formulations.Predicted targets were then mapped to the Reactome pathway database to identifythe biological processes affected. To facilitate the prediction of moleculartargets and associated pathways for any user-specified cannabis formulation, wedeveloped CANDI (Cannabis-derived compound Analysis and Network DiscoveryInterface), a web-based server. This platform offers a user-friendly interfacefor researchers and drug developers to explore the therapeutic potential ofcannabis compounds. RESULTS: Our analysis using DRIFT and CANDI successfullyidentified numerous molecular targets of cannabis compounds, many of which areinvolved in pathways relevant to pain, inflammation, cancer, and other diseases.The CANDI server enables researchers to predict the molecular targets andaffected pathways for any specific cannabis formulation, providing valuableinsights for developing targeted therapies. CONCLUSIONS: By combiningcomputational approaches with knowledge of traditional cannabis use, we havedeveloped the CANDI server, a tool that allows us to harness the therapeuticpotential of cannabis compounds for the effective treatment of various disorders.By bridging traditional pharmaceutical development with cannabis-based medicine,we propose a novel approach for botanical-based treatment modalities.","Ekambaram, Srinivasan, Wang, Jian, Dokholyan, Nikolay V",2025,Journal of cannabis research,1
TA050988,10.3390/pharmaceutics17030334,Incomplete Decarboxylation of Acidic Cannabinoids in GC-MS Leads toUnderestimation of the Total Cannabinoid Content in Cannabis Oils WithoutDerivatization.,"Background: Cannabis oil titration consists of quantification of the acidicprecursors tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) andtheir decarboxylated products, the active neutral cannabinoidsdelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), and is recommendedto ensure galenic preparation quality through gas and liquid chromatographycoupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS; LC-MS). Analyses by LC-MS and GC-MSinvolving derivatization allow for detection of acidic and neutral cannabinoids;on the contrary, GC-MS without derivatization determines only neutralcannabinoids due to high temperature-decarboxylation occurring in the injectionsystem. However, it is not clear if decarboxylation is complete. Methods:Different GC-MS methods with (BSTFA: TMCS and pyridine; incubation at 60 °C for25 min) or without derivatization and an LC-MS method were developed forcannabinoid quantification. The total Δ9-THC and CBD yield of recovery werecompared between the methods by testing laboratory samples with knownconcentrations of THCA and CBDA (total Δ9-THC and CBD: 175-351-702 ng/mL) andreal cannabis oil samples (n = 6). Results: The total Δ9-THC and CBD yield ofrecovery were determined using LC-MS and GC-MS with derivatization, but not usingGC-MS without derivatization (decarboxylation conversion rate of about 50-60%).No high deviation (<10%) in the total neutral cannabinoid concentrations in realcannabis oil samples was noticed, probably due to the low content of acidic formsin the original galenic preparation. Conclusions: This study raised awarenessabout the potential underestimation of the total Δ9-THC and CBD content incannabis oils when quantification is performed by GC-MS without derivatization.The advice for pharmacists is to perform complete decarboxylation to convert allacidic precursors in neutral cannabinoids.","Franzin, Martina, Di Lenardo, Rebecca, Ruoso, Rachele, Addobbati, Riccardo",2025,Pharmaceutics,1

In the Mediterranean region, the agricultural industry generatesconsiderable quantities of citrus fruits, leading to significant byproduct waste,which remains underutilized. To help address this, this study explored thevalorization of orange peel waste using non-thermal ultrasonic-assistedextraction (UAE) and a one-factor-at-a-time experimental design to investigatethe effects of nine chemical and physical UAE parameters. The goal was toidentify ideal operational ranges for each parameter using several responses(bioactive compound recovery, antioxidant activity, and radical scavengingactivity), thus elucidating the most influential UAE factors and their role inco-extracting various classes of natural compounds. The key findings revealedthat the polarity and ionic potential of the extraction medium, tuned throughethanol:water or pH, significantly influenced both the chemical profile andbioactivity of the extracts. Notably, citric acid and citrates appeared tostabilize co-extracted compounds. Lower solid-to-liquid ratios increased yields,while particle sizes between 1400 and 710 µm enhanced phenolic recovery byapproximately 150 mg/L GAE. In contrast, increases in pulse, probe diameter,immersion depth, and extraction time led to degradation of bioactive compounds,whereas the maximal amplitude improved phenolic acid recovery by up to 2-fold.Collectively, these insights provide a foundation for optimizing non-thermal UAEto valorize orange peel waste.","Xuereb, Matthew A, Psakis, Georgios, Attard, Karen, Lia, Frederick, Gatt, Ruben",2025,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

NTAP was applied at a frequencyof 13.56 MHz, exposure time of 15 s, discharge temperature of 25 °C, and powerlevels (T1 = 50, T2 = 80, and T3 = 120 W).Results demonstrated significantincreases (P < 0.05) in fresh and dry biomass at all treatment levels compared tocontrol, with the highest improvements seen in T3. Mineral content (K, P, Ca, Fe,Mg, Zn, and N) was significantly elevated, particularly at T3. Chlorophyllcontent (a + b and carotenoids) also showed marked increases across alltreatments, correlating with enhanced photosynthetic rates. Improvedphotosynthesis led to enhanced accumulation of primary metabolites, such as aminoacids, organic acids, and fatty acids. NTAP treatments, mainly T3, significantlyincreased levels of essential and non-essential amino acids, oxalic, isobutyric,and fumaric acids. They also enhanced unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid(C18:1), and saturated fatty acids, including myristic (C14:0) and stearic(C18:0). These improvements provided precursors for the synthesis of secondarymetabolites, particularly phenolics. The increased phenolic content in turnexplained the improved antioxidant capacity observed in Fluorescence RecoveryAfter Photobleaching FRAP, anti-lipid peroxidation, superoxide radicalscavenging, and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays, especially at T2 and T3treatments.

The relationship between lycopene in blood and sensorineuralhearing loss in elderly adults has rarely been reported. This study aimed toelucidate the connection between serum lycopene levels and sensorineural hearingloss among elderly individuals. This cross-sectional study included 693participants aged 70-80 years from the National Health and Nutrition ExaminationSurvey (NHANES) from 2017 to 2018. The outcomes included sensorineurallow-frequency hearing loss [pure-tone average (PTA) at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz ≥ 20dB], speech-frequency hearing loss (PTA at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz ≥ 20 dB), andhigh-frequency hearing loss (PTA at 4, 6, and 8 kHz ≥ 20 dB). Multivariatelogistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship betweenlycopene in blood and the risk of hearing loss. There were 418 (60.3%), 522(75.3%), and 667 (96.2%) participants who experienced hearing loss at low,speech, and high frequencies, respectively.

OC cells utilizecellular metabolic reprogramming to gain a survival advantage, particularlythrough aberrant lipid metabolic process. As the primary ingredient in exogenouscannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD) has been confirmed to exhibit antitumor activityin preclinical studies. However, it is still unclear whether CBD can disruptfatty acid metabolism and induce apoptosis in OC cells. In this study, we havedemonstrated that CBD significantly inhibits the proliferation of OCs through acannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R)-mediated manner. Fatty acid metabolicprofiling and flow cytometry analysis revealed that CBD has the ability todecrease fatty acid levels and significantly suppress the transcription of genesinvolved in fatty acid uptake and synthesis in ES-2 cells. In addition, theanalysis from RNA-seq and real-time RT-PCR revealed that CBD activated theendoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway. Conversely, by supplementation withunsaturated fatty acid or blocking CB1R, ER stress or reactive oxygen species(ROS) signals with specific inhibitors could significantly relieve CBD induced,dose-dependent, ER stress associated apoptosis, G0-G1 phase arrest, andmitochondrial dysfunction. Taken collectively, these data indicate that CBD maydisrupt lipid metabolism, and lead to ER stress-related apoptosis in OCs.

This study aims to investigatethe protective effects of GA, GLA and their combination and to explore theirunderlying mechanisms against acute liver damage induced by azithromycin (AZM) inrats. Seven groups of male Wistar rats were used namely control, GA, GLA, AZM,AZM + GA, AZM + GLA, and AZM + GA + GLA groups. We treated the rats for 21 days,administering GA and GLA at 50 mg/kg one week prior to AZM (30 mg/kg). Serumlevels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkalinephosphatase in rats AZM-induced and pre-treated with of GA, GLA, and combinationtherapy were much lower than those in the AZM group Elevated levels ofglutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase in preventive rats demonstratedthat GA, GLA, and their combinations notably reduced AZM-induced malondialdehydelevels, an oxidative stress marker, improving the antioxidant system in thosegroups. Furthermore, GA, GLA, and their combinations reduced pro-inflammatorycytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB),thus reversing hepatic inflammation. We also discovered that AZM down-regulatednuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and that its normal levelswere restored post treatments with GA, GLA, and their combination suggesting aNrf2 signaling pathway-mediated prevention of AZM-induced liver damage. Inconclusion, GA, GLA, and their combination protected rats against AZM-inducedliver injury through their demonstrated ability to lower oxidative stress andinflammation by preventing downregulation of Nrf2 and upregulation of NF-kB.After determining their efficacy and safety in clinical settings in futurestudies, GA and GLA could potentially make useful therapeutic drugs to mitigateAZM-induced hepatotoxicity.","Ali, Marwa Ahmed Mohamed, Matouk, Asmaa Ibrahim, Hamza, Alaaeldin Ahmed, Amin, Amr, Heeba, Gehan Hussein",2025,Scientific reports,1

However, it remains unclear whetherRA and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling can modulate antitumor immunity byreversing immune exhaustion of innate-like γδ T cells in human nasopharyngealcarcinoma (NPC). Periphery blood samples from patients with NPC wereprospectively collected, and phenotypic and functional analyses of γδ T cellswere performed using flow cytometry. Tumor-bearing models and RAR inhibitorapproaches were utilized to investigate RA/RAR-mediated regulation of T cellimmunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) and the antitumor activity of γδT cells. Here, our findings indicate that immune exhaustion markers are highlyexpressed on peripheral αβ and γδ T cells in NPC patients. Serum RA levels arenegatively correlated with the abundance of Tim-3 on circulating Vδ2 T cells.Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that RA/RAR signaling directly targets Vδ2T cells, repressing Tim-3 expression, promoting NF-κB activation, and enhancingthe production of antitumor-related cytokines. Notably, RA supplementationimproved the efficacy of Vδ2 T cell-mediated immunotherapy in human NPC bysuppressing Tim-3 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that RA/RARsignaling plays a crucial role in reversing immune exhaustion and represents apromising target for γδ T cell antitumor immunotherapy.","Liu, Guichao, Quan, Qiang, Pan, Lanhong, Duan, Haibo, Zhang, Guojun, Li, Ke, Zhu, Xinhai, Zhang, Dongdong, Li, Peng, Zhao, Jianfu",2025,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,1

TA051635,10.1155/2015/862391,Flax Fiber Hydrophobic Extract Inhibits Human Skin Cells Inflammation and CausesRemodeling of Extracellular Matrix and Wound Closure Activation.,"Inflammation is the basis of many diseases, with chronic wounds amongst them,limiting cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Our previous preclinicalstudy of flax fiber applied as a wound dressing and analysis of its componentsimpact on the fibroblast transcriptome suggested flax fiber hydrophobic extractuse as an anti-inflammatory and wound healing preparation. The extract containscannabidiol (CBD), phytosterols, and unsaturated fatty acids, showing greatpromise in wound healing. In in vitro proliferation and wound closure tests theextract activated cell migration and proliferation. The activity of matrixmetalloproteinases in skin cells was increased, suggesting activation ofextracellular components remodeling. The expression of cytokines was diminishedby the extract in a cannabidiol-dependent manner, but β-sitosterol can actsynergistically with CBD in inflammation inhibition. Extracellular matrix relatedgenes were also analyzed, considering their importance in further stages of woundhealing. The extract activated skin cell matrix remodeling, but the changes wereonly partially cannabidiol- and β-sitosterol-dependent. The possible role offatty acids also present in the extract is suggested. The study shows thehydrophobic flax fiber components as wound healing activators, withanti-inflammatory cannabidiol acting in synergy with sterols, and migration andproliferation promoting agents, some of which still require experimentalidentification.","Styrczewska, Monika, Kostyn, Anna, Kulma, Anna, Majkowska-Skrobek, Grazyna, Augustyniak, Daria, Prescha, Anna, Czuj, Tadeusz, Szopa, Jan",2015,BioMed research international,1

Meta-analysis was conducted to obtain pooled relativerisks (RRs) for the highest-versus-lowest categories of blood lutein andzeaxanthin concentrations. One cohort study and seven cross-sectional studieswere included in the meta-analysis. There were significant inverse associationsbetween nuclear cataract and blood lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations, with thepooled RRs ranging from 0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49, 0.77) forzeaxanthin to 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.87) for lutein. A stronger associationbetween nuclear cataract and blood zeaxanthin might be noted for the studiesconducted in the European Nations. Blood lutein and zeaxanthin were also noted tolead towards a decrease in the risk of cortical cataract and subcapsularcataract; however, these pooled RRs were not statistically significant, with theexception of a marginal association between lutein and subcapsular cataract. Ourresults suggest that high blood lutein and zeaxanthin are significantlyassociated with a decrease in the risk of nuclear cataract. However, nosignificant associations were found for ARC in other regions of the lens.","Liu, Xiao-Hong, Yu, Rong-Bin, Liu, Rong, Hao, Zhen-Xuan, Han, Cheng-Cheng, Zhu, Zhong-Hai, Ma, Le",2014,Nutrients,1

This study investigated the occurrenceand types of adverse effects associated with exposure to fragranced products inAustralia, and opportunities for prevention. Data were collected in June 2016using an on-line survey with a representative national sample (n = 1098).Overall, 33% of Australians report health problems, such as migraine headachesand asthma attacks, when exposed to fragranced products. Of these health effects,more than half (17.1%) could be considered disabling under the AustralianDisability Discrimination Act. Additionally, 7.7% of Australians have lostworkdays or a job due to illness from fragranced product exposure in theworkplace, 16.4% reported health problems when exposed to air fresheners ordeodorizers, 15.3% from being in a room after it was cleaned with scentedproducts, and 16.7% would enter but then leave a business as quickly as possibledue to fragranced products. About twice as many respondents would prefer thatworkplaces, health care facilities and professionals, hotels, and airplanes werefragrance-free rather than fragranced. While 73.7% were not aware that fragrancedproducts, even ones called green and organic, emitted hazardous air pollutants,56.3% would not continue to use a product if they knew it did. This is the firststudy in Australia to assess the extent of adverse effects associated withexposure to common fragranced products. It provides compelling evidence for theimportance and value of reducing fragranced product exposure in order to reduceand prevent adverse health effects and costs.","Steinemann, Anne",2017,Preventive medicine reports,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The organism was collected fromLakshadweep Island. The isolated sterols were identified using Gaschromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The structure was confirmed by usingcomparison of their spectra those in National Institute of Standard Technology(NIST) library. The apoptosis inducing effect of identified sterols weredetermined by PASS online prediction. In vitro cytotoxity studies were carriedout using Dalton's lymphoma ascites cells (DLA) and the cell viability wasdetermined by trypan blue exclusion method. RESULTS: Six sterols were identifiedfrom the soft coral S. reticulata. They are Cholesta-5,22-diene-3ol (3β),Ergosta-5-22-dien-3ol (3β,22E 24S), Cholesterol,26,26-Dimethyl-5,24(28)-ergostadien-3β-ol. β-sitosterol, and Fucosterol. Insilico predictions showed that the identified sterols exhibited remarkableapoptosis agonist activity. The probability of apoptosis agonist activity werefound maximum for 26,26-Dimethyl-5,24 (28)-S. reticulata sterol fractionsisolated were found to be having anticancer activity.

Furthermore,∆9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A (THCA-A), the biogenetic precursor of THC, isfound in the hair of persons who solely handled cannabis material. In the lightof the serious consequences of positive test results the mechanisms of drugincorporation into hair urgently need scientific evaluation. Here we show thatneither THC nor THCA-A are incorporated into human hair in relevant amounts aftersystemic uptake. THC-COOH, which is considered an incontestable proof of THCuptake according to the current scientific doctrine, was found in hair, but wasalso present in older hair segments, which already grew before the oral THCintake and in sebum/sweat samples. Our studies show that all three cannabinoidscan be present in hair of non-consuming individuals because of transfer throughcannabis consumers, via their hands, their sebum/sweat, or cannabis smoke. Thisis of concern for e.g. child-custody cases as cannabinoid findings in a child'shair may be caused by close contact to cannabis consumers rather than byinhalation of side-stream smoke.","Moosmann, Bjoern, Roth, Nadine, Auwärter, Volker",2015,Scientific reports,1

Malaria then resurged andrecurrent malaria after treatment with AL and stock-outs of AL were common. Thisstudy therefore aimed to assess the efficacy of AL and identify an alternativesecond line antimalarial. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was chosen as ithas been shown to be safe and efficacious and to reduce the incidence ofrecurrent malaria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a multicentre randomised open-labelnon-inferiority clinical trial, AL or DP were given over 3 days to children aged6 months-15 years with uncomplicated P. falciparum mono-infection. Intake wasobserved and AL was given with milk. Children were seen on days 0, 1, 2 and 3 andthen weekly days 7-42. Recurring P. falciparum were classified as recrudescenceor new infections by genotyping. Between November 2012 and July 2015, 312children were randomised to AL (n = 155) or DP (n = 157). The day 42 PCR adjustedper protocol adequate clinical and parasitological responses were 95% and 100% inthe AL and DP groups respectively, Mantel-Haenszel weighted odds ratio (OR) 0.22(95% CI 0-0.68), p = 0.022.

To manage this pest, synthetic chemicals havetraditionally been used, some of which are well known to be potentially toxic tothe environment and humans. Therefore, alternative strategies for pest managementin greenhouse crops have been developed in recent years, including biologicalcontrol with natural enemies such as parasitoids, predators and entomopathogenicmicroorganisms as well as chemical control using plant extracts. Such extractshave shown toxicity to insects, which has positioned them as a common alternativein programs of integrated pest management. The objective of this study was toevaluate the effect of an unfractionated ethanolic extract of Cnidoscolusaconitifolius leaves on adult females of T. urticae under laboratory conditions.The extract was chemically characterized by recording its metabolic profile vialiquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, along with tentativemetabolite identification. The immersion technique and direct application to roseleaves were used to evaluate the effects of seven doses (10-2,000 µg/mL) of theethanol extract of C. aconitifolius leaves on T. urticae females under laboratoryconditions. The mortality and oviposition of individuals were recorded at 24, 48and 72 h. It was found that the C. aconitifolius leaf extract reduced fertilityand increased mortality in a dose-dependent manner.

Weinvestigated the effect and possible mechanism of SJP in the human internalmammary artery (IMA, n = 78) taken from patients undergoing coronary surgery. SJPcaused full relaxation in KCl- (99.4 ± 10.5%, n = 6) and U46619- (99.9 ± 5.6%, n= 6) contracted IMA. Pretreatment of IMA with plasma concentrations of SJP(1 mg/mL), calculated from the plasma concentration of its major componentborneol, significantly depressed the maximal contraction to KCl (from 35.8 ±6.0 mN to 12.6 ± 5.6 mN, P = 0.03) and U46619 (from 19.4 ± 2.9 mN to 5.7 ±2.4 mN, P = 0.007) while SJP at 10 mg/mL abolished the subsequent contraction.Endothelium denudation and inhibition of eNOS significantly altered theSJP-induced relaxation without changes of eNOS expression. We conclude that SJPhas a potent inhibitory effect on the vasoconstriction mediated by a variety ofvasoconstrictors in human arteries. The vasorelaxation involves bothendothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Thus, the effect of SJP onhuman arteries demonstrated in this study may prove to be particularly importantin vasorelaxing therapy in cardiovascular disease.","Bai, Xiao-Yan, Zhang, Ping, Yang, Qin, Liu, Xiao-Cheng, Wang, Jun, Tong, Yong-Ling, Xiong, Song-Jin, Liu, Li-Hua, Wang, Lei, He, Guo-Wei",2014,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,1
TA051986,10.18632/oncotarget.11972,Artesunate enhances the therapeutic response of glioma cells to temozolomide byinhibition of homologous recombination and senescence.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a malignant brain tumor with a dismal prognosis,shows a high level of chemo- and radioresistance and, therefore, attempts tosensitize glioma cells are highly desired. Here, we addressed the question ofwhether artesunate (ART), a drug currently used in the treatment of malaria,enhances the killing response of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide (TMZ), whichis the first-line therapeutic for GBM. We measured apoptosis, necrosis, autophagyand senescence, and the extent of DNA damage in glioblastoma cells. Further, wedetermined the tumor growth in nude mice. We show that ART enhances the killingeffect of TMZ in glioblastoma cell lines and in glioblastoma stem-like cells. TheDNA double-strand break level induced by TMZ was not clearly enhanced in thecombined treatment regime. Also, we did not observe an attenuation of TMZ-inducedautophagy, which is considered a survival mechanism. However, we observed asignificant effect of ART on homologous recombination (HR) with downregulation ofRAD51 protein expression and HR activity. Further, we found that ART is able toinhibit senescence induced by TMZ. Since HR and senescence are pro-survivalmechanisms, its inhibition by ART appears to be a key node in enhancing theTMZ-induced killing response. Enhancement of the antitumor effect of TMZ byco-administration of ART was also observed in a mouse tumor model. In conclusion,the amelioration of TMZ-induced cell death upon ART co-treatment provides arational basis for a combination regime of TMZ and ART in glioblastoma therapy.","Berte, Nancy, Lokan, Stefanie, Eich, Marcus, Kim, Ella, Kaina, Bernd",2016,Oncotarget,1

Quisqualis indica flowers change colour fromwhite to pink to red may be associated with a shift from moth to butterflypollination. To test this hypothesis, we investigated Q. indica populations inSouthwest China. Flowers secreted nectar continuously from the evening ofanthesis until the following morning, then decreased gradually with floral colourchange. The scent compounds in the three floral colour stages were similar;however, the scent composition was different, and the scent emission ratedecreased from the white to red stage. Dichogamy in Q. indica preventsself-pollination and interference of male and female functions. Controlledpollinations demonstrated that this species is self-incompatible and needspollinators for seed production. Different pollinators were attracted in eachfloral colour stage; mainly moths at night and bees and butterflies during theday. Observations of open-pollinated inflorescences showed that white flowers hada higher fruit set than pink or red flowers, indicating the high contribution ofmoths to reproductive success. We concluded that the nectar and scent secretionare related to floral colour change in Q. indica, in order to attract differentpollinators and promote reproductive fitness.","Yan, Juan, Wang, Gang, Sui, Yi, Wang, Menglin, Zhang, Ling",2016,Scientific reports,1

TA052151,10.1093/jxb/erw102,Increasing abscisic acid levels by immunomodulation in barley grains inducesprecocious maturation without changing grain composition.,"Abscisic acid (ABA) accumulates in seeds during the transition to the seedfilling phase. ABA triggers seed maturation, storage activity, and stresssignalling and tolerance. Immunomodulation was used to alter the ABA status inbarley grains, with the resulting transgenic caryopses responding to the anti-ABAantibody gene expression with increased accumulation of ABA. Calculation of freeversus antibody-bound ABA reveals large excess of free ABA, increasingsignficantly in caryopses from 10 days after fertilization. Metabolite andtranscript profiling in anti-ABA grains expose triggered and enhancedABA-functions such as transcriptional up-regulation of sucrose-to-starchmetabolism, storage protein synthesis and ABA-related signal transduction. Thus,enhanced ABA during transition phases induces precocious maturation butnegatively interferes with growth and development. Anti-ABA grains display broadconstitutive gene induction related to biotic and abiotic stresses. Most of thesegenes are ABA- and/or stress-inducible, including alcohol and aldehydedehydrogenases, peroxidases, chaperones, glutathione-S-transferase, drought- andsalt-inducible proteins. Conclusively, ABA immunomodulation results in precociousABA accumulation that generates an integrated response of stress and maturation.Repression of ABA signalling, occurring in anti-ABA grains, potentiallyantagonizes effects caused by overshooting production. Finally, mature grainweight and composition are unchanged in anti-ABA plants, although germination issomewhat delayed. This indicates that anti-ABA caryopses induce specificmechanisms to desensitize ABA signalling efficiently, which finally yields maturegrains with nearly unchanged dry weight and composition. Such compensationimplicates the enormous physiological and metabolic flexibilities of barleygrains to adjust effects of unnaturally high ABA amounts in order to ensure andmaintain proper grain development.","Staroske, Nicole, Conrad, Udo, Kumlehn, Jochen, Hensel, Götz, Radchuk, Ruslana, Erban, Alexander, Kopka, Joachim, Weschke, Winfriede, Weber, Hans",2016,Journal of experimental botany,1
TA052178,10.1155/2015/359358,Evaluation of the effectiveness of Piper cubeba extract in the amelioration ofCCl4-induced liver injuries and oxidative damage in the rodent model.,"Background. Liver diseases still represent a major health burden worldwide.Moreover, medicinal plants have gained popularity in the treatment of severaldiseases including liver. Thus, the present study was to evaluate theeffectiveness of Piper cubeba fruits in the amelioration of CCl4-induced liverinjuries and oxidative damage in the rodent model. Methods. Hepatoprotectiveactivity was assessed using various biochemical parameters like SGOT, SGPT,γ-GGT, ALP, total bilirubin, LDH, and total protein. Meanwhile, in vivoantioxidant activities as LPO, NP-SH, and CAT were measured in rat liver as wellas mRNA expression of cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10 and stress relatedgenes iNOS and HO-1 were determined by RT-PCR. The extent of liver damage wasalso analyzed through histopathological observations. Results. Treatment withPCEE significantly and dose dependently prevented drug induced increase in serumlevels of hepatic enzymes. Furthermore, PCEE significantly reduced the lipidperoxidation in the liver tissue and restored activities of defense antioxidantenzymes NP-SH and CAT towards normal levels. The administration of PCEEsignificantly downregulated the CCl4-induced proinflammatory cytokines TNFα andIL-6 mRNA expression in dose dependent manner, while it upregulated the IL-10 andinduced hepatoprotective effect by downregulating mRNA expression of iNOS andHO-1 gene.","AlSaid, Mansour, Mothana, Ramzi, Raish, Mohammad, Al-Sohaibani, Mohammed, Al-Yahya, Mohammed, Ahmad, Ajaz, Al-Dosari, Mohammed, Rafatullah, Syed",2015,BioMed research international,1
TA052208,10.1038/srep38556,Molecular characterization of firefly nuptial gifts: a multi-omics approach shedslight on postcopulatory sexual selection.,"Postcopulatory sexual selection is recognized as a key driver of reproductivetrait evolution, including the machinery required to produce endogenous nuptialgifts. Despite the importance of such gifts, the molecular composition of thenon-gametic components of male ejaculates and their interactions with femalereproductive tracts remain poorly understood. During mating, male Photinusfireflies transfer to females a spermatophore gift manufactured by multiplereproductive glands. Here we combined transcriptomics of both male and femalereproductive glands with proteomics and metabolomics to better understand thesynthesis, composition and fate of the spermatophore in the common Easternfirefly, Photinus pyralis. Our transcriptome of male glands revealedup-regulation of proteases that may enhance male fertilization success andactivate female immune response. Using bottom-up proteomics we identified 208functionally annotated proteins that males transfer to the female in theirspermatophore. Targeted metabolomic analysis also provided the first evidencethat Photinus nuptial gifts contain lucibufagin, a firefly defensive toxin. Thereproductive tracts of female fireflies showed increased gene expression forseveral proteases that may be involved in egg production. This study offers newinsights into the molecular composition of male spermatophores, and extends ourunderstanding of how nuptial gifts may mediate postcopulatory interactionsbetween the sexes.","Al-Wathiqui, Nooria, Fallon, Timothy R, South, Adam, Weng, Jing-Ke, Lewis, Sara M",2016,Scientific reports,1
TA052212,10.1371/journal.ppat.1005773,Plant-Mediated Effects on Mosquito Capacity to Transmit Human Malaria.,"The ecological context in which mosquitoes and malaria parasites interact hasreceived little attention, compared to the genetic and molecular aspects ofmalaria transmission. Plant nectar and fruits are important for the nutritionalecology of malaria vectors, but how the natural diversity of plant-derived sugarsources affects mosquito competence for malaria parasites is unclear. To testthis, we infected Anopheles coluzzi, an important African malaria vector, withsympatric field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum, using direct membrane feedingassays. Through a series of experiments, we then examined the effects of sugarmeals from Thevetia neriifolia and Barleria lupilina cuttings that includedflowers, and fruit from Lannea microcarpa and Mangifera indica on parasite andmosquito traits that are key for determining the intensity of malariatransmission. We found that the source of plant sugar meal differentiallyaffected infection prevalence and intensity, the development duration of theparasites, as well as the survival and fecundity of the vector. These effects arelikely the result of complex interactions between toxic secondary metabolites andthe nutritional quality of the plant sugar source, as well as of host resourceavailability and parasite growth. Using an epidemiological model, we show thatplant sugar source can be a significant driver of malaria transmission dynamics,with some plant species exhibiting either transmission-reducing or -enhancingactivities.","Hien, Domonbabele F D S, Dabiré, Kounbobr R, Roche, Benjamin, Diabaté, Abdoulaye, Yerbanga, Rakiswende S, Cohuet, Anna, Yameogo, Bienvenue K, Gouagna, Louis-Clément, Hopkins, Richard J, Ouedraogo, Georges A, Simard, Frédéric, Ouedraogo, Jean-Bosco, Ignell, Rickard, Lefevre, Thierry",2016,PLoS pathogens,1

Thetemperature (T) factor was evaluated for MAE, while for SFE, pressure (P),temperature (T), and co-solvent (ethanol) (CS) were evaluated. The maximumextraction yield of the obtained oleoresin was (4.07% ± 0.14%) and (4.27% ±0.10%) for SFE and MAE, respectively. Extracts were characterized by gaschromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography flame ionizationdetector (GC-FID). The maximum contents of functional lipophilic compounds in theSFE and MAE extracts were: for carotenoids 283 ± 0.10 μg/g and 629 ± 0.13 μg/g,respectively; for tocopherols 5.01 ± 0.05 μg/g and 2.46 ± 0.09 μg/g,respectively; and for fatty acids 34.76 ± 0.08 mg/g and 15.88 ± 0.06 mg/g,respectively. In conclusion, the SFE process at P 450 bar, T 60 °C and CS 53.33%of CO₂ produced the highest yield of tocopherols, carotenoids and fatty acids.The MAE process at 400 W and 50 °C gives the best extracts in terms oftocopherols and carotenoids. For yield and fatty acids, the MAE process at 400 Wand 70 °C produced the highest values. Both SFE and MAE showed to be suitablegreen extraction technologies for obtaining functional lipophilic compounds fromArthrospira platensis.","Esquivel-Hernández, Diego A, López, Víctor H, Rodríguez-Rodríguez, José, Alemán-Nava, Gibrán S, Cuéllar-Bermúdez, Sara P, Rostro-Alanis, Magdalena, Parra-Saldívar, Roberto",2016,International journal of molecular sciences,1
TA052285,10.1111/mmi.12993,Mating type-dependent partner sensing as mediated by VEL1 in Trichoderma reesei.,"Sexual development in the filamentous model ascomycete Trichoderma reesei (syn.Hypocrea jecorina) was described only a few years ago. In this study, we show anovel role for VELVET in fungi, which links light response, development andsecondary metabolism. Vel1 is required for mating in darkness, normal growth andconidiation. In light, vel1 was dispensable for male fertility but essential forfemale fertility in both mating types. VEL1 impacted regulation of the pheromonesystem (hpr1, hpr2, hpp1, ppg1) in a mating type-dependent manner and dependingon the mating partner of a given strain. These partner effects only occurred forhpp1 and hpr2, the pheromone precursor and receptor genes associated with theMAT1-2 mating type and for the mating type gene mat1-2-1. Analysis of secondarymetabolite patterns secreted by wild type and mutants under asexual and sexualconditions revealed that even in the wild type, the patterns change uponencounter of a mating partner, with again distinct differences for wild type andvel1 mutants. Hence, T. reesei applies a language of pheromones and secondarymetabolites to communicate with mating partners and that this communication is atleast in part mediated by VEL1.","Bazafkan, Hoda, Dattenböck, Christoph, Böhmdorfer, Stefan, Tisch, Doris, Stappler, Eva, Schmoll, Monika",2015,Molecular microbiology,1

In thisstudy, we investigated the effects of nonselective TRPM7 inhibitor carvacrol oncell proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145cells. Our results showed that carvacrol blocked TRPM7-like currents in PC-3 andDU145 cells and reduced their proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover,carvacrol treatment significantly decreased MMP-2, p-Akt, and p-ERK1/2 proteinexpression and inhibited F-actin reorganization. Furthermore, consistently, TRPM7knockdown reduced prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion aswell.

TA052425,10.3390/ijms17101719,Development of an Advanced HPLC-MS/MS Method for the Determination of Carotenoidsand Fat-Soluble Vitamins in Human Plasma.,"The concentration of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins in human plasma mayplay a significant role in numerous chronic diseases such as age-related maculardegeneration and some types of cancer. Although these compounds are of utmostinterest for human health, methods for their simultaneous determination arescarce. A new high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry(MS/MS) method for the quantification of selected carotenoids and fat-solublevitamins in human plasma was developed, validated, and then applied in a pilotdietary intervention study with healthy volunteers. In 50 min, 16 analytes wereseparated with an excellent resolution and suitable MS signal intensity. Theproposed HPLC-MS/MS method led to improvements in the limits of detection (LOD)and quantification (LOQ) for all analyzed compounds compared to the most oftenused HPLC-DAD methods, in some cases being more than 100-fold lower. LOD valueswere between 0.001 and 0.422 µg/mL and LOQ values ranged from 0.003 to 1.406µg/mL, according to the analyte. The accuracy, precision, and stability met withthe acceptance criteria of the AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists)International. According to these results, the described HPLC-MS/MS method isadequately sensitive, repeatable and suitable for the large-scale analysis ofcompounds in biological fluids.","Hrvolová, Barbora, Martínez-Huélamo, Miriam, Colmán-Martínez, Mariel, Hurtado-Barroso, Sara, Lamuela-Raventós, Rosa Maria, Kalina, Jiří",2016,International journal of molecular sciences,1

Altogether, 196 hyperspectral images ofcucumber leaves with five infection severities of ALS were captured by ahyperspectral imaging system in the range of 380-1,030 nm covering 512 wavebands.Mean spectrum were extracted from regions of interest (ROIs) in the hyperspectralimages. Partial least square regression (PLSR) models were used to developquantitative analysis between the spectra and the pigment contents measured bybiochemical analyses. In addition, regression coefficients (RCs) in PLSR modelswere employed to select important wavelengths (IWs) for modelling. It was foundthat the PLSR models developed by the IWs provided the optimal measurementresults with correlation coefficient (R) of prediction of 0.871 and 0.876 for Chland Car contents, respectively. Finally, Chl and Car distributions in cucumberleaves with the ALS infection were mapped by applying the optimal modelspixel-wise to the hyperspectral images. The results proved the feasibility ofhyperspectral imaging for visualizing the pigment distributions in cucumberleaves in response to ALS.","Zhao, Yan-Ru, Li, Xiaoli, Yu, Ke-Qiang, Cheng, Fan, He, Yong",2016,Scientific reports,1

The presentstudy was designed to investigate all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) as an inducer ofTGF-β2 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and to elucidate the involvedsignaling mechanisms. METHODS: AtRA effects on intestinal epithelium wereinvestigated using IEC6 cells. TGF-β2 expression was measured using reversetranscriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blots.Signaling pathways were investigated using Western blots,transiently-transfected/transduced cells, kinase arrays, chromatinimmunoprecipitation, and selective small molecule inhibitors. RESULTS:AtRA-treatment of IEC6 cells selectively increased TGF-β2 mRNA and proteinexpression in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, and increased the activity ofthe TGF-β2 promoter. AtRA effects were mediated via RhoA GTPase, Rho-associated,coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), p38α MAPK, and activatingtranscription factor (ATF)-2. AtRA increased phospho-ATF2 binding to the TGF-β2promoter and increased histone H2B acetylation in the TGF-β2 nucleosome, which istypically associated with transcriptional activation. CONCLUSIONS: AtRA inducesTGF-β2 expression in IECs via RhoA- and p38α MAPK-mediated activation of thetranscription factor ATF2. Further studies are needed to investigate the role ofatRA as a protective/therapeutic agent in gut mucosal inflammation.","Namachivayam, Kopperuncholan, MohanKumar, Krishnan, Arbach, Dima, Jagadeeswaran, Ramasamy, Jain, Sunil K, Natarajan, Viswanathan, Mehta, Dolly, Jankov, Robert P, Maheshwari, Akhil",2015,PloS one,1
TA052596,10.3892/mmr.2016.5648,Cabazitaxel-induced autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway contributes to A549cell death.,"Cabazitaxel has been used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer since itsapproval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010. However, whethercabazitaxel may inhibit the proliferation of other tissue‑derived cancer cells,and its underlying mechanism, remains unknown. In the present study, the A549lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell line was exposed to cabazitaxel, in order toinvestigate its cytotoxic effect and determine the underlying mechanism. Theresults demonstrated that cabazitaxel was able to induce autophagy in A549 cells,as evidenced by the formation of autophagosomes, upregulated LC3‑II expressionand increased LC3 puncta. Cabazitaxel‑induced autophagy had a cytotoxic effect onA549 cells, as evidenced by the induction of cell death and cell cycle arrest atG2/M phase, which was independent of the apoptotic pathway. Furthermore,transfection with Beclin1 small interfering RNA and treatment with the autophagyinhibitor 3‑methyladenine protected cells from cabazitaxel‑induced cell death,thus confirming that cabazitaxel‑induced autophagy contributed to A549 celldeath. In addition, cabazitaxel targeted the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase(PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway to induce autophagy, asindicated by reduced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. In conclusion, the presentstudy demonstrated that cabazitaxel exerts a cytotoxic effect on A549 cells byacting on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to promote autophagic cell death. This resultsupports the potential use of cabazitaxel as a chemotherapeutic agent for thetreatment of lung cancer.","Huo, Ruichao, Wang, Lili, Liu, Peijuan, Zhao, Yong, Zhang, Caiqin, Bai, Bing, Liu, Xueying, Shi, Changhong, Wei, Sanhua, Zhang, Hai",2016,Molecular medicine reports,1
TA052620,10.1002/mbo3.381,Protein engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae transporter Pdr5p identifies keyresidues that impact Fusarium mycotoxin export and resistance to inhibition.,"Cereal infection by the broad host range fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum isa significant global agricultural and food safety issue due to the deposition ofmycotoxins within infected grains. Methods to study the intracellular effects ofmycotoxins often use the baker's yeast model system (Saccharomyces cerevisiae);however, this organism has an efficient drug export network known as thepleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) network, which consists of a family ofmultidrug exporters. This study describes the first study that has evaluated thepotential involvement of all known or putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC)transporters from the PDR network in exporting the F. graminearum trichothecenemycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15A-DON) fromliving yeast cells. We found that Pdr5p appears to be the only transporter fromthe PDR network capable of exporting these mycotoxins. We engineered mutants ofPdr5p at two sites previously identified as important in determining substratespecificity and inhibitor susceptibility. These results indicate that it ispossible to alter inhibitor insensitivity while maintaining the ability of Pdr5pto export the mycotoxins DON and 15A-DON, which may enable the development ofresistance strategies to generate more Fusarium-tolerant crop plants.","Gunter, Amanda B, Hermans, Anne, Bosnich, Whynn, Johnson, Douglas A, Harris, Linda J, Gleddie, Steve",2016,MicrobiologyOpen,1
TA052668,10.1371/journal.pone.0133414,All-Trans Retinoic Acid Ameliorates Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury byReducing Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis.,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury interferes with the restoration ofblood flow to ischemic myocardium. Oxidative stress-elicited apoptosis has beenreported to contribute to I/R injury. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) hasanti-apoptotic activity as previously reported. Here, we investigated the effectsand the mechanism of action of ATRA on myocardial I/R injury both in vivo and invitro. In vivo, ATRA reduced the size of the infarcted area (17.81±1.05% vs.24.41±1.03%, P<0.05) and rescued cardiac function loss (ejection fraction46.42±6.76% vs. 37.18±4.63%, P<0.05) after I/R injury. Flow-cytometric analysisand TUNEL assay demonstrated that the protective role of ATRA on myocardial I/Rinjury was related to its anti-apoptotic effects. The anti-apoptotic effects ofATRA were associated with partial inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS)production and significantly less phosphorylation of mitogen-activated proteinkinases (MAPKs) including p38, JNK, and ERK. Western blot analysis also revealedthat ATRA pre-treatment increased a disintegrin and metalloproteinasedomain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) expression (0.65 ± 0.20 vs. 0.41±0.02 invivo) and reduced the level of receptor for advanced glycation end-products(RAGE) (0.38 ± 0.17 vs. 0.52 ± 0.11 in vivo). Concomitantly, the protective roleof ATRA on I/R injury was not observed in RAGE-KO mice. The current resultsindicated that ATRA could prevent myocardial injury and reduced cardiomyocyteapoptosis after I/R effectively. One possible mechanism underlying these effectsis that ATRA could increase ADAM10 expression and thus cleave RAGE, which is themain receptor up-stream of MAPKs in myocardial I/R injury, resulting in thedown-regulation of MAPK signaling and protective role on myocardial I/R injury.","Zhu, Zhengbin, Zhu, Jinzhou, Zhao, Xiaoran, Yang, Ke, Lu, Lin, Zhang, Fengru, Shen, Weifeng, Zhang, Ruiyan",2015,PloS one,1
TA052672,10.1186/1476-4598-13-265,Probenecid as a sensitizer of bisphosphonate-mediated effects in breast cancercells.,"BACKGROUND: Anti-resorptive bisphosphonates (BP) are used for the treatment ofosteoporosis and bone metastases. Clinical studies indicated a benefit insurvival and tumor relapse in subpopulations of breast cancer patients receivingzoledronic acid, thus stimulating the debate about its anti-tumor activity.Amino-bisphosphonates in nM concentrations inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphatesynthase leading to accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and theATP/pyrophosphate adduct ApppI, which induces apoptosis in osteoclasts. Foranti-tumor effects μM concentrations are needed and a sensitizer forbisphosphonate effects would be beneficial in clinical anti-tumor applications.We hypothesized that enhancing intracellular pyrophosphate accumulation viainhibition of probenecid-sensitive channels and transporters would sensitizetumor cells for bisphosphonates anti-tumor efficacy. METHOD: MDA-MB-231, T47D andMCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with BP (zoledronic acid, risedronate,ibandronate, alendronate) and the pyrophosphate channel inhibitors probenecid andnovobiocin. We determined cell viability and caspase 3/7 activity (apoptosis),accumulation of IPP and ApppI, expression of ANKH, PANX1, ABCC1, SLC22A11, andthe zoledronic acid target gene and tumor-suppressor KLF2. RESULTS: Treatment ofMDA-MB-231 with BP induced caspase 3/7 activity, with zoledronic acid being themost effective. In MCF-7 and T47D either BP markedly suppressed cell viabilitywith only minor effects on apoptosis. Co-treatment with probenecid enhanced BPeffects on cell viability, IPP/ApppI accumulation as measurable in MCF-7 and T47Dcells, caspase 3/7 activity and target gene expression. Novobiocin co-treatmentof MDA-MB-231 yielded identical results on viability and apoptosis compared toprobenecid, rendering SLC22A family members as candidate modulators of BPeffects, whereas no such evidence was found for ANKH, ABCC1 and PANX1.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrate effects of various bisphosphonates oncaspase 3/7 activity, cell viability and expression of tumor suppressor genes inbreast cancer cells. Blocking probenecid and novobiocin-sensitive channels andtransporters enhances BP anti-tumor effects and renders SLC22A family members asgood candidates as BP modulators. Further studies will have to unravel iftreatment with such BP-sensitizers translates into preclinical and clinicalefficacy.","Ebert, Regina, Meissner-Weigl, Jutta, Zeck, Sabine, Määttä, Jorma, Auriola, Seppo, Coimbra de Sousa, Sofia, Mentrup, Birgit, Graser, Stephanie, Rachner, Tilman D, Hofbauer, Lorenz C, Jakob, Franz",2014,Molecular cancer,1

Although expected to play a major role in structuring plant-pollinatorinteractions, community-wide patterns of flower scent signals remain largelyunexplored. Here we show for the first time that scent advertisement is higher inplant species that bloom early in the flowering period when pollinators arescarce relative to flowers than in species blooming later in the season whenthere is a surplus of pollinators relative to flowers. We also show that lessabundant flowering species that may compete with dominant species for pollinatorvisitation early in the flowering period emit much higher proportions of thegeneralist attractant β-ocimene. Overall, we provide a first community-widedescription of the key role of seasonal dynamics of plant-specific flower scentemissions, and reveal the coexistence of contrasting plant signaling strategiesin a plant-pollinator market.","Filella, Iolanda, Primante, Clara, Llusià, Joan, Martín González, Ana M, Seco, Roger, Farré-Armengol, Gerard, Rodrigo, Anselm, Bosch, Jordi, Peñuelas, Josep",2013,Scientific reports,1

We show that local infusion of garcinol into therat lateral amygdala (LA) impairs the training and retrieval-related acetylationof histone H3 in the LA. Further, we show that either intra-LA or systemicadministration of garcinol within a narrow window after either fear conditioningor fear memory retrieval significantly impairs the consolidation andreconsolidation of a Pavlovian fear memory and associated neural plasticity inthe LA. Our findings suggest that a naturally-occurring compound derived from thediet that regulates chromatin function may be useful in the treatment of newlyacquired or recently reactivated traumatic memories.","Maddox, Stephanie A, Watts, Casey S, Doyère, Valérie, Schafe, Glenn E",2013,PloS one,1

The main aim of this study was to identify the attacker-specific andgeneral defence response signatures in A. thaliana when attacked byphloem-feeding aphids or pathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: The obtained annotatednetworks of differentially expressed transcripts indicated that members oftranscription factor families, such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, BHLH and bZIP, could becrucial for stress-specific defence regulation in Arabidopsis during aphid and P.syringae attack. The defence response pathways, signalling pathways and metabolicprocesses associated with aphid attack and P. syringae infection partiallyoverlapped. Components of several important biosynthesis and signalling pathways,such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET) andglucosinolates, were differentially affected during the two the treatments.Several stress-regulated transcription factors were known to be associated withstress-inducible microRNAs. The differentially regulated gene sets included manysignature transcription factors, and our co-expression analysis showed that theywere also strongly co-expressed during 69 other biotic stress experiments.CONCLUSIONS: Defence responses and functional networks that were unique andspecific to aphid or P. syringae stresses were identified. Furthermore, ouranalysis revealed a probable link between biotic stress and microRNAs inArabidopsis and, thus gives indicates a new direction for conducting large-scaletargeted experiments to explore the detailed regulatory links between them. Thepresented results provide a comparative understanding of Arabidopsis - B.brassicae and Arabidopsis - P. syringae interactions at the transcriptomic level.","Barah, Pankaj, Winge, Per, Kusnierczyk, Anna, Tran, Diem Hong, Bones, Atle M",2013,PloS one,1
TA052899,10.3390/ijms140610809,Chicken cytochrome P450 1A5 is the key enzyme for metabolizing T-2 toxin to3'OH-T-2.,"The transmission of T-2 toxin and its metabolites into the edible tissues ofpoultry has potential effects on human health. We report that T-2 toxinsignificantly induces CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 expression in chicken embryonichepatocyte cells. The enzyme activity assays of CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 heterologouslyexpressed in HeLa cells indicate that only CYP1A5 metabolizes T-2 to 3'OH-T-2 bythe 3'-hydroxylation of isovaleryl groups. In vitro enzyme assays of recombinantCYP1A5 expressed in DH5α further confirm that CYP1A5 can convert T-2 into TC-1(3'OH-T-2). Therefore, CYP1A5 is critical for the metabolism of trichothecenemycotoxin in chickens.","Shang, Shufeng, Jiang, Jun, Deng, Yiqun",2013,International journal of molecular sciences,1

Mixtures ofmethanol-ethyl acetate (6:4, v/v) and methanol-tetrahydrofuran (1:1, v/v) werethe most effective solvent systems for carotenoid extraction from maize endospermunder the conditions assayed. In addition, we also addressed sample preparationprior to the analysis of carotenoids by liquid chromatography (LC). The LCresponse of extracted carotenoids and standards in several solvents was evaluatedand results were related to the degree of solubility of these pigments. Three keyfactors were found to be important when selecting a suitable injection solvent:compatibility between the mobile phase and injection solvent, carotenoid polarityand content in the matrix.","Rivera, Sol, Canela, Ramon",2012,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1
TA052924,10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01310.x,Fenretinide metabolism in humans and mice: utilizing pharmacological modulationof its metabolic pathway to increase systemic exposure.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High plasma levels of fenretinide[N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR)] were associated with improved outcome ina phase II clinical trial. Low bioavailability of 4-HPR has been limiting itstherapeutic applications. This study characterized metabolism of 4-HPR in humansand mice, and to explore the effects of ketoconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, asa modulator to increase 4-HPR plasma levels in mice and to increase the lowbioavailability of 4-HPR. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: 4-HPR metabolites wereidentified by mass spectrometric analysis and levels of 4-HPR and its metabolites[N-(4-methoxyphenyl)retinamide (4-MPR) and 4-oxo-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide(4-oxo-4-HPR)] were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).Kinetic analysis of enzyme activities and the effects of enzyme inhibitors wereperformed in pooled human and pooled mouse liver microsomes, and in humancytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme microsomes. In vivo metabolism of 4-HPR wasinhibited in mice. KEY RESULTS: Six 4-HPR metabolites were identified in theplasma of patients and mice. 4-HPR was oxidized to 4-oxo-4-HPR, at least in partvia human CYP3A4. The CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole significantly reduced4-oxo-4-HPR formation in both human and mouse liver microsomes. In two strains ofmice, co-administration of ketoconazole with 4-HPR in vivo significantlyincreased 4-HPR plasma concentrations by > twofold over 4-HPR alone and alsoincreased 4-oxo-4-HPR levels. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mice may serve as anin vivo model of human 4-HPR pharmacokinetics. In vivo data suggest that theco-administration of ketoconazole at normal clinical doses with 4-HPR mayincrease systemic exposure to 4-HPR in humans.","Cooper, Jason P, Hwang, Kyunghwa, Singh, Hardeep, Wang, Dong, Reynolds, C Patrick, Curley, Robert W Jr, Williams, Simon C, Maurer, Barry J, Kang, Min H",2011,British journal of pharmacology,1

The mPCR assay was standardizedtargeting trichothecene metabolic pathway genes viz., Tri6, Tri7, Tri13 fordetection of trichothecene (DON/NIV) chemotypes and rDNA gene for specificdetection of F. culmorum species. Primers for targeted genes were designed andused to predict whether these isolates could produce deoxynivalenol/nivalenol, 94isolates were able to produce DON/NIV by mPCR assay. Chemical analysis of DON/NIVwas carried out for mPCR positive isolates by high performance-thin layerchromatography (HPTLC). To check the practical usefulness of developed mPCRassay, 150 field samples of maize were evaluated and results were compared withconventional HPTLC method. Out of 150 samples, 34% samples stayed as a positivefor NIV contamination whereas 44% were found to have deoxynivalenolcontamination. Moreover, mPCR results are equivocally matched with the HPTLCchemical analysis for field samples. Chemotyping of F. culmorum isolates werereported for the first time from India, and highlights the important potential ofF. culmorum to contaminate maize with DON/NIV.","Venkataramana, M, Shilpa, P, Balakrishna, K, Murali, H S, Batra, H V",2013,Brazilian journal of microbiology : [publication of the Brazilian Society forMicrobiology],1
TA052985,10.1371/journal.pone.0046336,Tolerogenic dendritic cells that inhibit autoimmune arthritis can be induced by acombination of carvacrol and thermal stress.,"Tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) can induce regulatory T cells and dampenpathogenic T cell responses. Therefore, they are possible therapeutic targets inautoimmune diseases. In this study we investigated whether mouse tolerogenic DCsare induced by the phytonutrient carvacrol, a molecule with knownanti-inflammatory properties, in combination with a physiological stress. We showthat treatment of DCs with carvacrol and thermal stress led to the mRNAexpression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Interestingly, treatedDCs with this mixed gene expression profile had a reduced ability to activatepro-inflammatory T cells. Furthermore, these DCs increased the proportion ofFoxP3(+) regulatory T cells. In vivo, prophylactic injection of carvacrol-thermalstress treated DCs pulsed with the disease inducing antigen was able to suppressdisease in a mouse model of arthritis. These findings suggest that treatment ofmouse bone marrow derived DCs with carvacrol and thermal stress induce afunctionally tolerogenic DC that can suppress autoimmune arthritis. Herewithcarvacrol seems to offer novel opportunities for the development of a dietarybased intervention in chronic inflammatory diseases.","Spiering, Rachel, van der Zee, Ruurd, Wagenaar, Josée, Kapetis, Dimos, Zolezzi, Francesca, van Eden, Willem, Broere, Femke",2012,PloS one,1
TA053033,10.1007/s10456-013-9334-0,The pharmacological bases of the antiangiogenic activity of paclitaxel.,"In the mid 1990s, researchers began to investigate the antiangiogenic activity ofpaclitaxel as a possible additional mechanism contributing to its antineoplasticactivity in vivo. In the last decade, a number of studies showed that paclitaxelhas antiangiogenic activity that could be ascribed to the inhibition of eithertubule formation or cell migration, and to an antiproliferative effect towardsactivated endothelial cells. Furthermore, paclitaxel was shown to downregulateVEGF and Ang-1 expression in tumor cells, and to increase the secretion of TSP-1in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the new pharmaceutical formulations ofpaclitaxel (such as liposome-encapsulated paclitaxel, ABI-007, and paclitaxelentrapped in emulsifying wax nanoparticles) enhanced the in vivo antiangiogenicactivity of the drug. Thus, the preclinical data of paclitaxel may be exploitedto implement a novel and rational therapeutic strategy to control tumorprogression in patients.","Bocci, Guido, Di Paolo, Antonello, Danesi, Romano",2013,Angiogenesis,1

However, limited efficacy andtolerability data are available on alternative forms of ACT in Vietnam in casethere is a reduction in the susceptibility of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Astudy was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two fixed-doseformulations of ACT, artemisinin-piperaquine (Artequick®, ARPQ) andartesunate-amodiaquine (Coarsucam™, ASAQ) for the treatment of P. falciparummalaria in south-central Vietnam. METHODS: A randomized, open-label trial wasconducted comparing the efficacy of a two-day regimen of ARPQ (~2.8 mg/kgartemisinin plus ~17.1 mg/kg of piperaquine per day) and a three-day regimen ofASAQ (~4.7 mg/kg of artesunate plus ~12.6 mg/kg of amodiaquine per day) for thetreatment of children and adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Primaryefficacy endpoint was day 42, PCR-corrected, parasitological cure rate. Secondaryendpoints were parasite and fever clearance times and tolerability. RESULTS: Of128 patients enrolled, 63 were administered ARPQ and 65 ASAQ. Of the patients whocompleted the 42 days follow-up period or had a recurrence of malaria, 55 were onARPQ (30 children, 25 adults) and 59 were on ASAQ (31 children, 28 adults).Recrudescent parasitaemia was PCR-confirmed for one patient in each treatmentgroup, with cure rates at day 42 of 98% (95% CI: 88-100) for both forms of ACT.The median parasite clearance time was significantly slower in the ARPQ groupcompared with the ASAQ group (48 h vs. 36 h, P<0.001) and fever clearance timeswere shorter in the ASAQ group (12 h vs. 24 h, P=0.07). The two forms of ACT werewell tolerated with no serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Both forms of ACT werehighly efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.Although the two-day course of ARPQ was equally as effective as the three-daycourse of ASAQ, parasite and fever clearance times were shorter with ASAQ.Further studies are warranted in different regions of Vietnam to determine thenationwide efficacy of ASAQ.

TA053181,10.1371/journal.pone.0016326,Carotenoid supplementation positively affects the expression of a non-visualsexual signal.,"Carotenoids are a class of pigments which are widely used by animals for theexpression of yellow-to-red colour signals, such as bill or plumage colour. Sincethey also have been shown to promote immunocompetence and to function asantioxidants, many studies have investigated a potential allocation trade-offwith respect to carotenoid-based signals within the context of sexual selection.Although an effect of carotenoids on non-visual (e.g. acoustic) signals involvedin sexual selection has been hypothesized, this has to date not beeninvestigated. First, we examined a potential effect of dietary carotenoidsupplementation on overall song rate during the non-breeding season in captivemale European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). After only 3-7 days, we found asignificant (body-mass independent) positive effect of carotenoid availability onoverall song rate. Secondly, as a number of studies suggest that carotenoidscould affect the modulation of sexual signals by plasma levels of the steroidhormone testosterone (T), we used the same birds to subsequently investigatewhether carotenoid availability affects the increase in (nestbox-oriented) songrate induced by experimentally elevated plasma T levels. Our results suggest thatcarotenoids may enhance the positive effect of elevated plasma T levels onnestbox-oriented song rate. Moreover, while non-supplemented starlings respondedto T-implantation with an increase in both overall song rate and nestbox-orientedsong, carotenoid-supplemented starlings instead shifted song production towards(reproductively relevant) nestbox-oriented song, without increasing overall songrate. Given that song rate is an acoustic signal rather than a visual signal, ourfindings therefore indicate that the role of carotenoids in (sexual) signallingneed not be dependent on their function as pigments.","Van Hout, Alain J-M, Eens, Marcel, Pinxten, Rianne",2011,PloS one,1
TA053200,10.1038/emm.2013.20,"Glyceollins, a novel class of soybean phytoalexins, inhibit SCF-inducedmelanogenesis through attenuation of SCF/c-kit downstream signaling pathways.","The anti-melanogenesis effect of glyceollins was examined by melanin synthesis,tyrosinase activity assay in zebrafish embryos and in B16F10 melanoma cells. Whendeveloping zebrafish embryos were treated with glyceollins, pigmentation of theembryos, melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity were all decreased comparedwith control zebrafish embryos. In situ expression of a pigment cell-specificgene, Sox10, was dramatically decreased by glyceollin treatment in the neuraltubes of the trunk region of the embryos. Stem cell factor (SCF)/c-kit signalingpathways as well as expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor(MITF) were determined by western blot analysis. Glyceollins inhibited melaninsynthesis, as well as the expression and activity of tyrosinase induced by SCF,in a dose-dependent manner in B16F10 melanoma cells. Pretreatment of B16F10 cellswith glyceollins dose-dependently inhibited SCF-induced c-kit and Aktphosphorylation. Glyceollins significantly impaired the expression and activityof MITF. An additional inhibitory function of glyceollins was to effectivelydownregulate intracellular cyclic AMP levels stimulated by SCF in B16F10 cells.Glyceollins have a depigmentation/whitening activity in vitro and in vivo, andthat this effect may be due to the inhibition of SCF-induced c-kit and tyrosinaseactivity through the blockade of downstream signaling pathway.","Shin, Sun-Hye, Lee, You-Mie",2013,Experimental & molecular medicine,1
TA053207,10.1186/1476-4598-9-15,Retinoic acid protects human breast cancer cells against etoposide-inducedapoptosis by NF-kappaB-dependent but cIAP2-independent mechanisms.,"BACKGROUND: Retinoids, through their cognate nuclear receptors, exert potenteffects on cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, and have significantpromise for cancer therapy and chemoprevention. These ligands can determine theultimate fate of target cells by stimulating or repressing gene expressiondirectly, or indirectly through crosstalking with other signal transducers.RESULTS: Using different breast cancer cell models, we show here that dependingon the cellular context retinoids can signal either towards cell death or cellsurvival. Indeed, retinoids can induce the expression of pro-apoptotic (i.e.TRAIL, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand, Apo2L/TNFSF10) and anti-apoptotic(i.e. cIAP2, inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2) genes. Promoter mapping, gelretardation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that retinoidsinduce the expression of this gene mainly through crosstalk with NF-kappaB.Supporting this crosstalk, the activation of NF-kappaB by retinoids in T47D cellsantagonizes the apoptosis triggered by the chemotherapeutic drugs etoposide,camptothecin or doxorubicin. Notably apoptosis induced by death ligands (i.e.TRAIL or antiFAS) is not antagonized by retinoids. That knockdown of cIAP2expression by small interfering RNA does not alter the inhibition ofetoposide-induced apoptosis by retinoids in T47D cells reveals that stimulationof cIAP2 expression is not the cause of their anti-apoptotic action. However,ectopic overexpression of a NF-kappaB repressor increases apoptosis by retinoidsmoderately and abrogates almost completely the retinoid-dependent inhibition ofetoposide-induced apoptosis. Our data exclude cIAP2 and suggest that retinoidstarget other regulator(s) of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway to induce resistanceto etoposide on certain breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows animportant role for the NF-kappaB pathway in retinoic acid signaling and retinoicacid-mediated resistance to cancer therapy-mediated apoptosis in breast cancercells, independently of cIAP2. Our data support the use of NF-kappaB pathwayactivation as a marker for screening that will help to develop novel retinoids,or retinoid-based combination therapies with improved efficacy.","Jiménez-Lara, Ana M, Aranda, Ana, Gronemeyer, Hinrich",2010,Molecular cancer,1
TA053210,10.1007/s00213-011-2428-8,Involvement of the endocannabinoid system in reward processing in the humanbrain.,"RATIONALE: Disturbed reward processing in humans has been associated with anumber of disorders, such as depression, addiction, and attention-deficithyperactivity disorder. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has been implicated inreward processing in animals, but in humans, the relation between eCB functioningand reward is less clear. OBJECTIVES: The current study uses functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the role of the eCB system in rewardprocessing in humans by examining the effect of the eCB agonistΔ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on reward-related brain activity. METHODS: Elevenhealthy males participated in a randomized placebo-controlled pharmacologicalfMRI study with administration of THC to challenge the eCB system. We comparedanticipatory and feedback-related brain activity after placebo and THC, using amonetary incentive delay task. In this task, subjects are notified before eachtrial whether a correct response is rewarded (""reward trial"") or not (""neutraltrial""). RESULTS: Subjects showed faster reaction times during reward trialscompared to neutral trials, and this effect was not altered by THC. THC induced awidespread attenuation of the brain response to feedback in reward trials but notin neutral trials. Anticipatory brain activity was not affected. CONCLUSIONS:These results suggest a role for the eCB system in the appreciation of rewards.The involvement of the eCB system in feedback processing may be relevant fordisorders in which appreciation of natural rewards may be affected such asaddiction.","van Hell, Hendrika H, Jager, Gerry, Bossong, Matthijs G, Brouwer, Annelies, Jansma, J Martijn, Zuurman, Lineke, van Gerven, Joop, Kahn, René S, Ramsey, Nick F",2012,Psychopharmacology,1

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 plays a major role inthis process. We previously revealed the importance of the mevalonate cascade inthe fibrotic response of human airway smooth muscle cells. We now investigatemevalonate cascade-associated signaling in TGFβ1-induced fibronectin expressionby bronchial fibroblasts from non-asthmatic and asthmatic subjects. METHODS: Weused simvastatin (1-15 μM) to inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methlyglutaryl-coenzyme A(HMG-CoA) reductase which converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Selective inhibitors ofgeranylgeranyl transferase-1 (GGT1; GGTI-286, 10 μM) and farnesyl transferase(FT; FTI-277, 10 μM) were used to determine whether GGT1 and FT contribute toTGFβ1-induced fibronectin expression. In addition, we studied the effects ofco-incubation with simvastatin and mevalonate (1 mM), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate(30 μM) or farnesylpyrophosphate (30 μM). RESULTS: Immunoblotting revealedconcentration-dependent simvastatin inhibition of TGFβ1 (2.5 ng/ml, 48 h)-inducedfibronectin. This was prevented by exogenous mevalonate, or isoprenoids(geranylgeranylpyrophosphate or farnesylpyrophosphate). The effects ofsimvastatin were mimicked by GGTI-286, but not FTI-277, suggesting fundamentalinvolvement of GGT1 in TGFβ1-induced signaling. Asthmatic fibroblasts exhibitedgreater TGFβ1-induced fibronectin expression compared to non-asthmatic cells;this enhanced response was effectively reduced by simvastatin. CONCLUSIONS: Weconclude that TGFβ1-induced fibronectin expression in airway fibroblasts relieson activity of GGT1 and availability of isoprenoids. Our results suggest thattargeting regulators of isoprenoid-dependent signaling holds promise for treatingairway wall fibrosis.","Schaafsma, Dedmer, McNeill, Karol D, Mutawe, Mark M, Ghavami, Saeid, Unruh, Helmut, Jacques, Eric, Laviolette, Michel, Chakir, Jamila, Halayko, Andrew J",2011,Respiratory research,1
TA053226,10.1093/jxb/ert052,Expression of ABA synthesis and metabolism genes under different irrigationstrategies and atmospheric VPDs is associated with stomatal conductance ingrapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv Cabernet Sauvignon).,"The influence of different levels of irrigation and of variation in atmosphericvapour pressure deficit (VPD) on the synthesis, metabolism, and transport ofabscisic acid (ABA) and the effects on stomatal conductance were examined infield-grown Cabernet Sauvignon grapevines. Xylem sap, leaf tissue, and roottissue were collected at regular intervals during two seasons in conjunction withmeasurements of leaf water potential (Ψleaf) and stomatal conductance (gs). Thedifferent irrigation levels significantly altered the Ψleaf and gs of the vinesacross both seasons. ABA abundance in the xylem sap was correlated with gs. Theexpression of genes associated with ABA synthesis, NCED1 and NCED2, was higher inthe roots than in the leaves throughout and highest in the roots in mid January,a time when soil moisture declined and VPD was at its highest. Their expressionin roots was also inversely related to the levels of irrigation and correlatedwith ABA abundance in the roots, xylem sap, and leaves. Three genes encoding ABA8'-hydroxylases were isolated and their identities confirmed by expression inyeast cells. The expression of one of these, Hyd1, was elevated in leaves whenVPD was below 2.0-2.5 kPa and minimal at higher VPD levels. The results provideevidence that ABA plays an important role in linking stomatal response to soilmoisture status and that changes in ABA catabolism at or near its site of actionallows optimization of gas exchange to current environmental conditions.","Speirs, Jim, Binney, Allan, Collins, Marisa, Edwards, Everard, Loveys, Brian",2013,Journal of experimental botany,1
TA053353,10.1371/journal.pone.0013305,Retinoic acid increases proliferation of human osteoclast progenitors andinhibits RANKL-stimulated osteoclast differentiation by suppressing RANK.,"It has been shown that high vitamin A intake is associated with bone fragilityand fractures in both animals and humans. However, the mechanism by which vitaminA affects bones is unclear. In the present study, the direct effects of retinoicacid (RA) on human and murine osteoclastogenesis were evaluated using culturedperipheral blood CD14(+) monocytes and RAW264.7 cells. Both the activity of theosteoclast marker tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in culturesupernatant and the expression of the genes involved in osteoclastdifferentiation together with bone resorption were measured. To our knowledge,this is the first time that the effects of RA on human osteoclast progenitors andmature osteoclasts have been studied in vitro. RA stimulated proliferation ofosteoclast progenitors both from humans and mice. In contrast, RA inhibiteddifferentiation of the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand(RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis of human and murine osteoclast progenitors viaretinoic acid receptors (RARs). We also show that the mRNA levels of receptoractivator of nuclear factor κB (RANK), the key initiating factor and osteoclastassociated receptor for RANKL, were potently suppressed by RA in osteoclastprogenitors. More importantly, RA abolished the RANK protein in osteoclastprogenitors. This inhibition could be partially reversed by a RAR pan-antagonist.Furthermore, RA treatment suppressed the expression of the transcription factornuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) and increased theexpression of interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8) in osteoclast progenitorsvia RARs. Also, RA demonstrated differential effects depending on the materialsupporting the cell culture. RA did not affect TRAP activity in the culturesupernatant in the bone slice culture system, but inhibited the release of TRAPactivity if cells were cultured on plastic. In conclusion, our results suggestthat retinoic acid increases proliferation of human osteoclast progenitors andthat it inhibits RANK-stimulated osteoclast differentiation by suppressing RANK.","Hu, Lijuan, Lind, Thomas, Sundqvist, Anders, Jacobson, Annica, Melhus, Håkan",2010,PloS one,1

In this study, we employed rats with unilateralureteral obstruction to determine whether AS-IV and FA have the samerenoprotective effects and investigated the mechanisms of this action.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Renal pathological changes were evaluated after treatmentwith AS-IV, FA or AS-IV + FA (AF) for 10 days. Meanwhile, the expression oftransforming growth factor β(1) (TGF-β(1) ), fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin(α-SMA), phosphorylation of c-Jun NH(2) -terminal kinase (p-JNK) and nitric oxide(NO) production in kidney were determined. The expressions of fibronectin, α-SMA,mitogen-activated protein kinases [JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases(ERK), P38] in TGF-β(1) -treated NRK-49F cells or interleukin-1-treated HK-2cells after AS-IV, FA or AF were assessed. KEY RESULTS: AF alleviated theinfiltration of mononuclear cells, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis;reduced the expression of fibronectin, α-SMA, TGF-β(1) and p-JNK; anddramatically increased the production of NO in obstructed kidneys. Neither AS-IVnor FA alone improved renal damage, but both increased NO production. AFinhibited α-SMA and fibronectin expression in NRK-49F or HK-2 cells. Furthermore,AF significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced JNK phosphorylation, without affectingERK or P38 phosphorylation. Neither AS-IV nor FA alone had any effect on thecells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: AS-IV synergizes with FA to alleviate renaltubulointerstitial fibrosis; this was associated with inhibition of tubularepithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT) and fibroblast activation, aswell as an increase in NO production in the kidney.","Meng, L Q, Tang, J W, Wang, Y, Zhao, J R, Shang, M Y, Zhang, M, Liu, S Y, Qu, L, Cai, S Q, Li, X M",2011,British journal of pharmacology,1

The objective of this study was to investigate theradio-protective effect of catalpol (a main bioactive component in thetraditional Chinese Rehmannia) on irradiated cells and mice. We found thattreating cells with catalpol (25-100 μg/ml) before irradiation couldsignificantly inhibit ionizing radiation (IR)-induced human lymphocyte AHH-1cells apoptosis and increase cells viability in vitro. At the same time our studyalso showed that catalpol (25-100 mg/kg) reduced morphological damage of thegastrointestinal tract by 15.6%, 33.3% and 44.4%, respectively compared with theradiation-induced group, decreased plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) intestinal8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels and increased plasma endogenousantioxidants and peripheral white blood cells and platelets in vivo.

TA053411,10.1186/1471-2229-13-165,Long-distance transport of Gibberellic Acid Insensitive mRNA in Nicotianabenthamiana.,"BACKGROUND: The Gibberellic Acid (GA) signal is governed by the GAI (GibberellicAcid Insensitive) repressor, which is characterized by a highly conservedN-terminal DELLA domain. Deletion of the DELLA domain results in constitutivesuppression of GA signaling. As the GAI transcript is transportable in phloemelements, a Δ-DELLA GAI (gai) transgenic stock plant can reduce the stature of ascion through transport of gai mRNA from the stock. However, little is knownabout the characteristics of a scion on a gai stock. RESULTS: Arabidopsis Δ-DELLAGAI (gai) was fused with a T7 epitope tag and expressed under the control of acompanion cell-specific expression promoter, Commelina yellow mottle viruspromoter (CoYMVp), to enhance transport in the phloem. The CoYMVp:Atgai-T7 (CgT)transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana exhibited a dwarf phenotype and lowersensitivity to GA enhancement of shoot stature. A wild-type (WT) scion on a CgTstock contained both Atgai-T7 mRNA and the translated product. Microarrayanalysis to clarify the effect of the CgT stock on the gene expression pattern inthe scion clearly revealed that the WT scions on CgT stocks had fewer genes whoseexpression was altered in response to GA treatment. An apple rootstock variety,Malus prunifolia, integrating CoYMVp:Atgai moderately reduced the tree height ofthe apple cultivar scion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Atgai mRNAcan move from companion cells to sieve tubes and that the translated productremains at the sites to which it is transported, resulting in attenuation of GAresponses by reducing the expression of many genes. The induction ofsemi-dwarfism in an apple cultivar on root stock harbouring Atgai suggests thatlong-distance transport of mRNA from grafts would be applicable to horticulturecrops.","Xu, Haiyan, Iwashiro, Reika, Li, Tianzhong, Harada, Takeo",2013,BMC plant biology,1
TA053433,10.1093/jxb/err214,Members of the gibberellin receptor gene family GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVEDWARF1) play distinct roles during Lepidium sativum and Arabidopsis thaliana seedgermination.,"Germination of endospermic seeds is partly regulated by the micropylar endosperm,which acts as constraint to radicle protrusion. Gibberellin (GA) signallingpathways control coat-dormancy release, endosperm weakening, and organ expansionduring seed germination. Three GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) GA receptorsare known in Arabidopsis thaliana: GID1a, GID1b, and GID1c. Molecularphylogenetic analysis of angiosperm GID1s reveals that they cluster into twoeudicot (GID1ac, GID1b) groups and one monocot group. Eudicots have at least onegene from each of the two groups, indicating that the different GID1 receptorsfulfil distinct roles during plant development. A comparative Brassicaceaeapproach was used, in which gid1 mutant and whole-seed transcript analyses inArabidopsis were combined with seed-tissue-specific analyses of its closerelative Lepidium sativum (garden cress), for which three GID1 orthologues werecloned. GA signalling via the GID1ac receptors is required for Arabidopsis seedgermination, GID1b cannot compensate for the impaired germination of thegid1agid1c mutant. Transcript expression patterns differed temporarily,spatially, and hormonally, with GID1b being distinct from GID1ac in both species.Endosperm weakening is mediated, at least in part, through GA-induced genesencoding cell-wall-modifying proteins. A suppression subtraction hybridization(SSH) cDNA library enriched for sequences that are highly expressed during earlygermination in the micropylar endosperm contained expansins and xyloglucanendo-transglycosylases/hydrolases (XTHs). Their transcript expression patterns inboth species strongly suggest that they are regulated by distinct GID1-mediatedGA signalling pathways. The GID1ac and GID1b pathways seem to fulfil distinctregulatory roles during Brassicaceae seed germination and seem to control theirdownstream targets distinctly.","Voegele, Antje, Linkies, Ada, Müller, Kerstin, Leubner-Metzger, Gerhard",2011,Journal of experimental botany,1
TA053435,10.1371/journal.pone.0009143,THC Prevents MDMA Neurotoxicity in Mice.,"The majority of MDMA (ecstasy) recreational users also consume cannabis. Despitethe rewarding effects that both drugs have, they induce several oppositepharmacological responses. MDMA causes hyperthermia, oxidative stress andneuronal damage, especially at warm ambient temperature. However, THC, the mainpsychoactive compound of cannabis, produces hypothermic, anti-inflammatory andantioxidant effects. Therefore, THC may have a neuroprotective effect againstMDMA-induced neurotoxicity. Mice receiving a neurotoxic regimen of MDMA (20 mg/kgx 4) were pretreated with THC (3 mg/kg x 4) at room (21 degrees C) and at warm(26 degrees C) temperature, and body temperature, striatal glial activation andDA terminal loss were assessed. To find out the mechanisms by which THC mayprevent MDMA hyperthermia and neurotoxicity, the same procedure was carried outin animals pretreated with the CB(1) receptor antagonist AM251 and the CB(2)receptor antagonist AM630, as well as in CB(1), CB(2) and CB(1)/CB(2) deficientmice. THC prevented MDMA-induced-hyperthermia and glial activation in animalshoused at both room and warm temperature. Surprisingly, MDMA-induced DA terminalloss was only observed in animals housed at warm but not at room temperature, andthis neurotoxic effect was reversed by THC administration. However, THC did notprevent MDMA-induced hyperthermia, glial activation, and DA terminal loss inanimals treated with the CB(1) receptor antagonist AM251, neither in CB(1) andCB(1)/CB(2) knockout mice. On the other hand, THC prevented MDMA-inducedhyperthermia and DA terminal loss, but only partially suppressed glial activationin animals treated with the CB(2) cannabinoid antagonist and in CB(2) knockoutanimals. Our results indicate that THC protects against MDMA neurotoxicity, andsuggest that these neuroprotective actions are primarily mediated by thereduction of hyperthermia through the activation of CB(1) receptor, althoughCB(2) receptors may also contribute to attenuate neuroinflammation in thisprocess.","Touriño, Clara, Zimmer, Andreas, Valverde, Olga",2010,PloS one,1
TA053444,10.1186/1471-2229-12-169,Arabidopsis mutant sk156 reveals complex regulation of SPL15 in amiR156-controlled gene network.,"BACKGROUND: The Arabidopsis microRNA156 (miR156) regulates 11 members of theSQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL) family by base pairing tocomplementary target mRNAs. Each SPL gene further regulates a set of other genes;thus, miR156 controls numerous genes through a complex gene regulation network.Increased axillary branching occurs in transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressingmiR156b, similar to that observed in loss-of-function max3 and max4 mutants withlesions in carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases. Arabidopsis miR156b was found toenhance carotenoid levels and reproductive shoot branching when expressed inBrassica napus, suggesting a link between miR156b expression and carotenoidmetabolism. However, details of the miR156 regulatory network of SPL genesrelated to carotenoid metabolism are not known. RESULTS: In this study, anArabidopsis T-DNA enhancer mutant, sk156, was identified due to its alteredbranching and trichome morphology and increased seed carotenoid levels comparedto wild type (WT) ecovar Columbia. Enhanced miR156b expression due to the 35Senhancers present on the T-DNA insert was responsible for these phenotypes.Constitutive and leaf primodium-specific expression of a miR156-insensitive(mutated) SPL15 (SPL15m) largely restored WT seed carotenoid levels and plantmorphology when expressed in sk156. The Arabidopsis native miR156-sensitive SPL15(SPL15n) and SPL15m driven by a native SPL15 promoter did not restore the WTphenotype in sk156. Our findings suggest that SPL15 function is somewhatredundant with other SPL family members, which collectively affect plantphenotypes. Moreover, substantially decreased miR156b transcript levels in sk156expressing SPL15m, together with the presence of multiple repeats of SPL-bindingGTAC core sequence close to the miR156b transcription start site, suggestedfeedback regulation of miR156b expression by SPL15. This was supported by thedemonstration of specific in vitro interaction between DNA-binding SBP domain ofSPL15 and the proximal promoter sequence of miR156b. CONCLUSIONS: EnhancedmiR156b expression in sk156 leads to the mutant phenotype including carotenoidlevels in the seed through suppression of SPL15 and other SPL target genes.Moreover, SPL15 has a regulatory role not only for downstream components, butalso for its own upstream regulator miR156b.","Wei, Shu, Gruber, Margaret Y, Yu, Bianyun, Gao, Ming-Jun, Khachatourians, George G, Hegedus, Dwayne D, Parkin, Isobel A P, Hannoufa, Abdelali",2012,BMC plant biology,1
TA053449,10.1371/journal.pone.0040943,ATRA inhibits the proliferation of DU145 prostate cancer cells through reducingthe methylation level of HOXB13 gene.,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been widely investigated for treatments ofmany cancers including prostate cancer. HOXB13, silenced in androgenreceptor-negative (AR(-)) prostate cancer cells, plays a role in AR(-) prostatecancer cell growth arrest. In this study we intended to elucidate the mechanismsthat are involved in the proliferation inhibition of AR(-) prostate cancer cellstriggered by ATRA. We discovered that ATRA was able to induce the growth arrestand to increase HOXB13 expression in AR(-) prostate cancer cells. Both EZH2 andDNMT3b participated in the repression of HOXB13 expression through an epigeneticmechanism involving DNA and histone methylation modifications. Specifically, EZH2recruited DNMT3b to HOXB13 promoter to form a repression complex. Moreover, ATRAcould upregulate HOXB13 through decreasing EZH2 and DNMT3b expressions andreducing their interactions with the HOXB13 promoter. Concurrently, themethylation level of the HOXB13 promoter was reduced upon the treatment of ATRA.Results from this study implicated a novel effect of ATRA in inhibition of thegrowth of AR(-) resistant human prostate cancer cells through alteration ofHOXB13 expression as a result of epigenetic modifications.","Liu, Zhiwei, Ren, Guoling, Shangguan, Chenyan, Guo, Lijing, Dong, Zhixiong, Li, Yueyang, Zhang, Weina, Zhao, Li, Hou, Pingfu, Zhang, Yu, Wang, Xiuli, Lu, Jun, Huang, Baiqu",2012,PloS one,1
TA053454,10.1371/journal.pone.0020249,Retinoic Acid signalling and the control of meiotic entry in the human fetalgonad.,"The development of mammalian fetal germ cells along oogenic or spermatogenic fatetrajectories is dictated by signals from the surrounding gonadal environment.Germ cells in the fetal testis enter mitotic arrest, whilst those in the fetalovary undergo sex-specific entry into meiosis, the initiation of which is thoughtto be mediated by selective exposure of fetal ovarian germ cells tomesonephros-derived retinoic acid (RA). Aspects of this model are hard toreconcile with the spatiotemporal pattern of germ cell differentiation in thehuman fetal ovary, however. We have therefore examined the expression ofcomponents of the RA synthesis, metabolism and signalling pathways, and theirdownstream effectors and inhibitors in germ cells around the time of theinitiation of meiosis in the human fetal gonad. Expression of the threeRA-synthesising enzymes, ALDH1A1, 2 and 3 in the fetal ovary and testis was equalto or greater than that in the mesonephros at 8-9 weeks gestation, indicating anintrinsic capacity within the gonad to synthesise RA. Using immunohistochemistryto detect RA receptors RARα, β and RXRα, we find germ cells to be the predominanttarget of RA signalling in the fetal human ovary, but also reveal widespreadreceptor nuclear localization indicative of signalling in the testis, suggestingthat human fetal testicular germ cells are not efficiently shielded from RA bythe action of the RA-metabolising enzyme CYP26B1. Consistent with this,expression of CYP26B1 was greater in the human fetal ovary than testis, althoughthe sexually-dimorphic expression patterns of the germ cell-intrinsic regulatorsof meiotic initiation, STRA8 and NANOS2, appear conserved. Finally, wedemonstrate that RA induces a two-fold increase in STRA8 expression in culturesof human fetal testis, but is not sufficient to cause widespreadmeiosis-associated gene expression. Together, these data indicate that whilelocal production of RA within the fetal ovary may be important in regulating theonset of meiosis in the human fetal ovary, mechanisms other than CYP26B1-mediatedmetabolism of RA may exist to inhibit the entry of germ cells into meiosis in thehuman fetal testis.","Childs, Andrew J, Cowan, Gillian, Kinnell, Hazel L, Anderson, Richard A, Saunders, Philippa T K",2011,PloS one,1

MucosalCD103(+) dendritic cells are able to produce retinoic acid from retinal, howevertheir role in vivo and how they are influenced by specific microbial species hasbeen poorly described. Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 (B. infantis) feeding tomice resulted in increased numbers of CD103(+)retinaldehyde dehydrogenase(RALDH)(+) dendritic cells within the lamina propria (LP). Foxp3(+) lymphocyteswere also increased in the LP, while TH1 and TH17 subsets were decreased.3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (citral) treatment of mice blocked the increase inCD103(+)RALDH(+) dendritic cells and the decrease in TH1 and TH17 lymphocytes,but not the increase in Foxp3(+) lymphocytes. B. infantis reduced the severity ofDSS-induced colitis, associated with decreased TH1 and TH17 cells within the LP.Citral treatment confirmed that these effects were RALDH mediated. RALDH(+)dendritic cells decreased within the LP of control inflamed animals, whileRALDH(+) dendritic cells numbers were maintained in the LP of B. infantis-fedmice. Thus, CD103(+)RALDH(+) LP dendritic cells are important cellular targetsfor microbiota-associated effects on mucosal immunoregulation.","Konieczna, Patrycja, Ferstl, Ruth, Ziegler, Mario, Frei, Remo, Nehrbass, Dirk, Lauener, Roger P, Akdis, Cezmi A, O'Mahony, Liam",2013,PloS one,1

Enzymes such as the lipases have also found applications inthe synthesis and degradation of polymeric materials. However, the use of thesenatural catalysts in the synthesis and the post-synthetic modification ofdendrimers and hyperbranched molecules is an application of chemistry yet to beexplored extensively. In this study the use of two hydrolytic enzymes, a lipasefrom Candida cylindracea and a cutinase from Fusarium solani pisii, wereinvestigated in the selective cleavage of ester groups situated on the peripherallayer of two families of branched polyamides. These branched polyamides wereconjugated to simple fragrances citronellol and L-menthol via ester linkages.Hydrolysis of the ester linkage between the fragrances and the branched polyamidesupport was carried out in aqueous buffered systems at slightly basic pH valuesunder the optimum operative conditions for the enzymes used. These preliminaryqualitative investigations revealed that partial cleavage of the esterfunctionalities from the branched polyamide support had occurred. However, theability of the enzymes to interact with the substrates decreased considerably asthe branching density, the rigidity of the structure and the bulkiness of thepolyamide-fragrance conjugates increased.","Aulenta, Francesca, Drew, Michael G B, Foster, Alison, Hayes, Wayne, Rannard, Steven, Thornthwaite, David W, Youngs, Tristan G A",2005,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1
TA053527,10.1186/1475-2875-8-S1-S4,Understanding the pharmacokinetics of Coartem.,"Artemether and lumefantrine (AL), the active constituents of Coartem exhibitcomplementary pharmacokinetic profiles. Artemether is absorbed quickly; peakconcentrations of artemether and its main active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin(DHA) occur at approximately two hours post-dose, leading to a rapid reduction inasexual parasite mass and a prompt resolution of symptoms. Lumefantrine isabsorbed and cleared more slowly (terminal elimination half-life 3-4 days inmalaria patients), and accumulates with successive doses, acting to preventrecrudescence by destroying any residual parasites that remain after artemetherand DHA have been cleared from the body. Food intake significantly enhances thebioavailability of both artemether and lumefantrine, an effect which is moreapparent for the highly lipophilic lumefantrine. However, a meal with only asmall amount of fat (1.6 g) is considered sufficient to achieve adequate exposureto lumefantrine. The pharmacokinetics of artemether or lumefantrine are similarin children, when dosed according to their body weight, compared with adults. Norandomized study has compared the pharmacokinetics of either agent in pregnantversus non-pregnant women. Studies in healthy volunteers and in children withmalaria have confirmed that the pharmacokinetic characteristics of crushedstandard AL tablets and the newly-developed Coartem Dispersible tabletformulation are similar. Studies to date in healthy volunteers have notidentified any clinically relevant drug-drug interactions; data relating toconcomitant administration of HIV therapies are limited. While dose-responseanalyses are difficult to undertake because of the low rate of treatment failuresunder AL, it appears that artemether and DHA exposure impact on parasiteclearance time while lumefantrine exposure is associated with cure rate,consistent with their respective modes of action. In conclusion, knowledge of thepharmacokinetic profiles of artemether and lumefantrine is increasing within arange of settings, including infants and children. However, additional data wouldbe warranted to better characterize artemether and lumefantrine pharmacokineticsin patients with hepatic impairment, in pregnant women, and in patientsundergoing HIV/AIDS chemotherapy.","Djimdé, Abdoulaye, Lefèvre, Gilbert",2009,Malaria journal,1

In the present study, we determined theeffects of RA on the differentiation of the mouse embryonic pancreas. Addition ofall-trans retinoic acid (atRA) to embryonic pancreatic cultures induced a numberof changes. Branching morphogenesis and exocrine differentiation were suppressedand there was premature formation of endocrine cell clusters (although the totalarea of beta cells was not different in control and atRA-treated buds). Weinvestigated the mechanism of these changes and found that the prematureformation of beta cells was associated with the early expression of high-levelPdx1 in the endocrine cell clusters. In contrast, the suppressive effect of RA onexocrine differentiation may be due to a combination of two mechanisms (i)up-regulation of the extracellular matrix component laminin and (ii) enhancementof apoptosis. We also demonstrate that addition of fibroblast growth factor(FGF)-10 is able to partially prevent apoptosis and rescue exocrinedifferentiation and branching morphogenesis in atRA-treated cultures but not inmice lacking the FGF receptor 2-IIIb, suggesting the effects of FGF-10 aremediated through this receptor.","Shen, Chia-Ning, Marguerie, Anita, Chien, Chiao-Yun, Dickson, Clive, Slack, Jonathan M W, Tosh, David",2007,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,1
TA053618,10.1186/1744-8069-5-62,Differential role of the menthol-binding residue Y745 in the antagonism ofthermally gated TRPM8 channels.,"BACKGROUND: TRPM8 is a non-selective cation channel that belongs to themelastatin subfamily of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels.TRPM8 is activated by voltage, cold and cooling compounds such as menthol.Despite its essential role for cold temperature sensing in mammals, thepharmacology of TRPM8 is still in its infancy. Recently, tyrosine 745 (Y745) wasidentified as a critical residue for menthol sensitivity of the channel. In thisreport, we study the effect of mutating this residue on the action of severalknown TRPM8 antagonists: BCTC, capsazepine, SKF96365, and clotrimazole as well astwo new inhibitor candidates, econazole and imidazole. RESULTS: We show that Y745at the menthol binding site is critical for inhibition mediated by SKF96365 ofcold- and voltage-activated TRPM8 currents. In contrast, the inhibition by otherantagonists was unaffected by the mutation (BCTC) or only partially reduced(capsazepine, clotrimazole, econazole), suggesting that additional binding sitesexist on the TRPM8 channel from where the inhibitors exert their negativemodulation. Indeed, a molecular docking model implies that menthol and SKF96365interact readily with Y745, while BCTC is unable to bind to this residue.CONCLUSION: In summary, we identify structural elements on the TRPM8 channel thatare critical for the action of channel antagonists, providing valuableinformation for the future design of new, specific modulator compounds.","Malkia, Annika, Pertusa, María, Fernández-Ballester, Gregorio, Ferrer-Montiel, Antonio, Viana, Félix",2009,Molecular pain,1

However, little is known about the mechanisms ofaction of different statins or the effects of these statins in gynaecologicalmalignancies. The apoptotic potential of two lipophilic statins (lovastatin andsimvastatin) and one hydrophilic statin (pravastatin) was assessed in cancer celllines (ovarian, endometrial and cervical) and primary cultured cancerous andnormal tissues. Cell viability was studied by MTS assays and apoptosis wasconfirmed by Western blotting of PARP and flow cytometry. The expressions of keyapoptotic cascade proteins were analysed. Our results demonstrate that bothlovastatin and simvastatin, but not pravastatin, selectively induced cell deathin dose- and time-dependent manner in ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers.Little or no toxicity was observed with any statin on normal cells. Lipophilicstatins induced activation of caspase-8 and -9; BID cleavage, cytochrome Crelease and PARP cleavage. Statin-sensitive cancers expressed high levels ofHMG-CoA reductase compared with resistant cultures. The effect of lipophilicstatins was dependent on inhibition of enzymatic activity of HMG-CoA reductasesince mevalonate pre-incubation almost completely abrogated the apoptotic effect.Moreover, the apoptotic effect involved the inhibition of synthesis ofgeranylgeranyl pyrophosphate rather than farnesyl pyrophosphate. In conclusion,lipophilic but not hydrophilic statins induce cell death through activation ofextrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic cascades in cancerous cells from the humanfemale genital tract, which express high levels of HMG-CoA reductase. Theseresults promote further investigation in the use of lipophilic statins asanticancer agents in gynaecological malignancies.","Kato, S, Smalley, S, Sadarangani, A, Chen-Lin, K, Oliva, B, Brañes, J, Carvajal, J, Gejman, R, Owen, G I, Cuello, M",2010,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,1

This suggests that thecarotenoids frequently found in these foods play a role in the prevention of thiscommon cancer. To examine associations between the intake of individual and totalcarotenoids and the risk of colorectal cancer, we analyzed prospective data fromthe Multiethnic Cohort Study. METHODS: This analysis includes 85 898 men and 105106 women who completed a quantitative food frequency questionnaire in 1993-1996.The participants were African Americans, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans,Latinos, and whites aged 45-75 years at cohort entry. After an average follow-upof 8.2 years, 1292 and 1086 incident cases of colorectal cancer were identifiedin men and women, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models were used toestimate relative risks of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: No significantassociations were found between intake of individual and total carotenoids andcolorectal cancer risk either in men or women, except for beta-cryptoxanthin,which showed a mild protective effect in men. When the associations wereinvestigated separately for colon and rectal cancer, lycopene intake was relatedto an increased risk of rectal cancer in men. A decreased risk was seen for totalbeta-carotene in male current smokers, but the test for interaction with smokingstatus was not significant. No association was observed in each ethnic-sex group.CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings do not support a significant associationbetween carotenoid intake and colorectal cancer, although some associations wereseen in subgroup analyses.","Park, Song-Yi, Nomura, Abraham M Y, Murphy, Suzanne P, Wilkens, Lynne R, Henderson, Brian E, Kolonel, Laurence N",2009,Journal of epidemiology,1
TA053677,10.1186/1471-213X-7-138,Retinoic acid is a potential dorsalising signal in the late embryonic chickhindbrain.,"BACKGROUND: Human retinoic acid teratogenesis results in malformations ofdorsally derived hindbrain structures such as the cerebellum, noradrenergichindbrain neurons and the precerebellar system. These structures originate fromthe rhombic lip and adjacent dorsal precursor pools that border the fourthventricle roofplate. While retinoic acid synthesis is known to occur in themeninges that blanket the hindbrain, the particular sensitivity of only dorsalstructures to disruptions in retinoid signalling is puzzling. We therefore lookedfor evidence within the neural tube for more spatiotemporally specific signallingpathways using an in situ hybridisation screen of known retinoic acid pathwaytranscripts. RESULTS: We find that there are highly restricted domains ofretinoic acid synthesis and breakdown within specific hindbrain nuclei as well asthe ventricular layer and roofplate. Intriguingly, transcripts of cellularretinoic acid binding protein 1 are always found at the interface betweendividing and post-mitotic cells. By contrast to earlier stages of development,domains of synthesis and breakdown in post-mitotic neurons are co-localised. Atthe rhombic lip, expression of the mRNA for retinoic acid synthesising andcatabolising enzymes is spatially highly organised with respect to theCath1-positive precursors of migratory precerebellar neurons. CONCLUSION: Thelate developing hindbrain shows patterns of retinoic acid synthesis and use thatare distinct from the well characterised phase of rostrocaudal patterning.Selected post-mitotic populations, such as the locus coeruleus, appear to bothmake and break down retinoic acid suggesting that a requirement for an autocrine,or at least a highly localised paracrine signalling network, might explain itsacute sensitivity to retinoic acid disruption. At the rhombic lip, retinoic acidis likely to act as a dorsalising factor in parallel with other roofplatesignalling pathways. While its precise role is unclear, retinoic acid ispotentially well placed to regulate temporally determined cell fate decisionswithin the rhombic lip precursor pool.","Wilson, Leigh J, Myat, Anna, Sharma, Aadhar, Maden, Malcolm, Wingate, Richard J T",2007,BMC developmental biology,1

Previously, wehave found differential Taxol resistance in human and murine hepatoma cells. Theaim of this study was to examine the effect of a multidrug resistance inhibitor,cyclosporin A in combination with Taxol on hepatoma in vitro and in vivo, and toidentify the possible mechanism involved in Taxol resistance. Simultaneoustreatment of cyclosporin A (0-10 microM) and Taxol (0.1 microM) inhibited cellgrowth in vitro. Cyclosporin A interfered with Taxol (0.1 microM)-induced AKTactivation and BAD phosphorylation. Cyclosporin A combined with Taxol treatmentaugments caspase-9, -3 activation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential inHepG2 cells. PI3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, or a dominant-negative AKT1expression vector treatment partially enhanced Taxol-induced apoptosis indicatingthat PI3 kinase-AKT pathway was involved in Taxol-resistance pathway. Moreover,combination treatment reduced tumour growth in SCID and C57BL/6 mice as comparedto either Taxol or cyclosporin A treatment. Our results indicate that thecombination of cyclosporin A and Taxol is effective in the reversal of Taxolresistance through the inhibition of PI3 kinase-AKT1 pathway.","Lin, H-L, Lui, W-Y, Liu, T-Y, Chi, C-W",2003,British journal of cancer,1

These plants exhibited symptoms of stunting, and abnormal development ofleaf, root, and vascular tissues. The encoded protein, PKV, is a novel member ofthe AGC VIIIa group of signal-transducing protein kinases; however, the role ofPKV in plant development is unknown. In this communication, we report thephenotypic results of over expression and silencing of pkv in transgenic tobacco.RESULTS: Over expression of pkv in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi (tobacco)resulted in stunting, reduced root formation, and delay in flowering, phenotypessimilar to symptoms of PSTVd infection of tomato. In addition, homozygous T2tobacco plants over expressing PKV were male sterile. Antisense expression ofpkv, on the other hand, resulted in plants that were taller than non-transformedplants, produced an increased number of flowers, and were fertile. Exogenousapplication of GA3 stimulated stem elongation in the stunted, sense-expressingplants. PKV sense and antisense expression altered transcript levels of GAbiosynthetic genes and genes involved in developmental and signaling pathways,but not genes involved in salicylic acid- or jasmonic acid-dependent pathways.Our data provide evidence suggesting that PKV plays an important role in a GAsignaling pathway that controls plant height and fertility. CONCLUSION: We havefound that the over expression of the tomato protein kinase PKV resulted instunting, modified vascular tissue development, reduced root formation, and malesterility in tobacco, and we propose that PKV regulates plant development byfunctioning in critical signaling pathways involved in gibberellic acidmetabolism.","Hammond, Rosemarie W, Zhao, Yan",2009,BMC plant biology,1

Fine cochineal (D. coccus) isproduced to extract carminic acid, and D. opuntiae, or wild cochineal, is aninvasive pest of O. ficus-indica in more than 20 countries around the world.Despite the economic and environmental relevance of this cactus, D. opuntiae, andD. coccus, there are few studies that have explored volatile organic compounds(VOCs) derived from the plant-insect interaction. The aim of this work was todetermine the VOCs produced by D. coccus and D. opuntiae and to identifydifferent VOCs in cladodes infested by each Dactylopius species. The VOCs(essential oils) were obtained by hydrodistillation and identified by GC-MS. Atotal of 66 VOCs from both Dactylopius species were identified, and 125 from theEsmeralda and Rojo Pelón cultivars infested by D. coccus and D. opuntiae,respectively, were determined.

Atotal of 74 volatile compounds were identified, including groups of aliphatichydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, sulfide compounds, esters, aromatichydrocarbons, nitrogenous compounds, acids and terpenes in sucuk. Slow ripeningresulted in significant increases in the abundance of ethanol, acetic acid, ethylacetate, acetoin and diacetyl. A similar situation was determined for a mixedculture (L. plantarum + S. xylosus). Correlation analysis showed that the effectsof slow ripening and mixed culture use were more pronounced in terms of volatilecompound content. Although the effect of fat type on volatile compounds was quitelimited compared to other factors, correlation analysis showed that STF had adifferent volatile compound profile.","Kaya, Mükerrem, Kaban, Güzin",2024,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",1

An untargetedmetabolomics approach was used to classify the volatile profiles of brandiesbased on the presence of different distillation systems and geographical origins.Through the predictive ability of PLS-DA models, it was found that higheralcohols, C13-norisopenoids, and furans could serve as key markers todiscriminate between continuous stills and pot stills, and the contents of C6/C9compounds, C13-norisoprenoids, and sesquiterpenoids were significantly affectedby brandy origin. A network analysis illustrated that straight-chain fatty acidethyl esters gradually accumulated during aging, and several higher alcohols,furfural, 5-methylfurfural, 4-ethylphenol, TDN, β-damascenone, naphthalene,styrene, and decanal were also positively correlated with aging time. This studyprovides effective methods for distinguishing brandies collected from differentdistillation systems and geographical origins and summarizes an overview of thechanges in volatile compounds during the aging process.","Hu, Ruiqi, Duan, Changqing, Lan, Yibin",2024,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",1
TA053876,10.1093/hr/uhae020,Genetic regulation of volatile production in two melon introgression linecollections with contrasting ripening behavior.,"The importance of melon aroma in determining fruit quality has been highlightedin recent years. The fruit volatile profile is influenced by the type of fruitripening. Non-climacteric fruits contain predominantly aldehydes, whileclimacteric fruits mainly produce esters. Several genes have been described toparticipate in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) biosynthesis pathways, butknowledge in this area is still incomplete. In this work we analysed the volatileprofile of two reciprocal Introgression Line (IL) collections generated from across between 'Piel de Sapo' (PS) and 'Védrantais' (VED) melons, differing intheir aroma profile and ripening behaviour. SPME GC-MS was performed to identifygenes responsible for VOCs formation. More than 1000 QTLs for many volatiles weredetected taken together both populations. Introgressions on chromosomes 3, 5, 6,7 and 8 modified ester-aldehyde balance and were correlated to ripening changesin both genetic backgrounds. Some previously identified QTLs for fruit ripeningmight be involved in these phenotypes, such as ETHQV8.1 on chromosome 8 andETHQV6.3 on chromosome 6. PS alleles on chromosomes 2, 6, 10 and 11 were found toincrease ester content when introgressed in VED melons. Terpenes showed to beaffected by several genomic regions not related to ripening. In addition, severalcandidate genes have been hypothesized to be responsible for some of the QTLsdetected. The analysis of volatile compounds in two reciprocal IL collections hasincreased our understanding of the relationship between ripening and aroma andoffers valuable plant material to improve food quality in melon breedingprograms.","Mayobre, Carlos, Santo Domingo, Miguel, Özkan, Elif Nur, Fernández-Borbolla, Andrés, Ruiz-Lasierra, Javier, Garcia-Mas, Jordi, Pujol, Marta",2024,Horticulture research,1

While previous studies have explored how thequality of CP changes over time, there has been limited research specifically onXHCP. This study aims to assess the chemical components and quality of XHCP basedon total flavonoid content (TF), antioxidant activity (AA), and color value (CV)at two stages: freshly harvested (XHCP-0Y) and after 3 years of storage(XHCP-3Y). Thirty-eight common volatile compounds were identified, and thecontent of 17 compounds among them, nine nonvolatile compounds, which includedone alkaloid (synephrine), three phenolic acids (PA, protocatechuic acid,vanillic acid, and ferulic acid), and five flavonoids (narirutin, hesperidin,sinensetin, nobiletin, and tangeretin), were firstly detected by the newlydeveloped gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and ultra-performanceliquid chromatography (UPLC) methods. Compared to XHCP-0Y, the content of 17volatile compounds and synephrine decreased in XHCP-3Y to varying degrees, whilethe content of PA, five flavonoids, TF, AA, and CV increased. The reduction ofdryness caused by volatile compounds and the enhancement of efficacy related toPA, flavonoids, and AA suggested improved quality of XHCP after 3 years ofstorage. The methods developed in this study show promise for evaluating thequality of XHCP during the aging process.","Shi, Junjie, Peng, Lihua, Chen, Weixuan, Qiao, Weilin, Wang, Kui, Xu, Yueyang, Cheng, Jinle",2024,Food science & nutrition,1

In thisstudy, we focused on analyzing transcriptional alterations in human dermalfibroblasts (HDFs) cell line challenged simultaneously with ethanol and CBD as anethanol-protective agent. We aimed to expose the genes and pathways responsiblefor at least some of the CBD effects in those cells that can be related to theAUD. Transcriptome analysis was performed using HDFs cell line that expressesboth cannabinoid receptors and can metabolize ethanol through alcoholdehydrogenase activity. Fibroblasts are also responsible for the progression ofliver fibrosis, a common comorbidity in AUD. With the use of a cellular test, wefound that CBD at the lowest applied concentration (0.75 μM) was able tostimulate depressed metabolism and reduce the level of apoptosis of cells treatedwith different concentrations of ethanol to the level observed in the controlcells. Similar observations were made at the transcriptome level, in which cellstreated with ethanol and CBD had similar expression profiles to the controlcells. CBD also affects several genes connected with extracellular matrixformation (especially its collagen constituent), which can have potentialimplications for, e.g., fibrosis process.","Gurgul, Artur, Żurowski, Jakub, Szmatoła, Tomasz, Kucharski, Mirosław, Sawicki, Sebastian, Semik-Gurgul, Ewelina, Ocłoń, Ewa",2024,Journal of applied genetics,1

METHODS: In this study, the rat model ofasthma was induced by ovalbumin (OVA), and the rats were treated with a decoctionof N. bracteata. Pathological changes in lung tissue were observed, and thequantification of eosinophils (EOS) and white blood cells (WBC) inbronchoalveolar lavage fluid was performed. Furthermore, the serum levels ofasthma-related factors induced by OVA were assessed. (1)H NMR spectroscopy serummetabolomics method was utilized to identify differential metabolites and theirassociated metabolic pathways. UPLC-QE-MS/MS combined with network pharmacologywas employed to predict the core targets and pathways of DBJJ in its actionagainst asthma. The anti-asthmatic properties of DBJJ were investigated using anintegrated approach of metabolomics and network pharmacology. The findings werevalidated through molecular docking and Western blotting analysis of the keytargets. RESULTS: The administration of DBJJ effectively alleviated OVA-inducedlung histopathological changes and decreased the number of EOS and WBC in BALF.Additionally, DBJJ inhibited the OVA-induced elevation of TNF-α, IL-18, Ig-E,EOS, IL-1β, MDA, VEGF-A, and TGF-β1. A total of 21 biomarkers and 10 pathwayswere found by metabolomics analysis. A total of 29 compounds were identified byUPLC-QE-MS/MS, in which 13 active components were screened by oral availabilityand Caco-2 cell permeability, the 120 targets and 173 KEGG pathways werepredicted. The integration of metabolomics and network pharmacological analysisrevealed that DBJJ's main constituents, including ferulic acid and ursolic acid,exerted their effects on four targets, namely DAO and NOS2, as well as theirassociated metabolites and pathways. The active constituents of DBJJ demonstrateda high binding affinity towards DAO and NOS2. Furthermore, DBJJ was observed todecrease the protein expression and phosphorylation levels of NOS2, MAPK, andSTAT3. CONCLUSION: The administration of DBJJ demonstrates notable anti-asthmaproperties in rats with allergic asthma. This effect can be attributed to themodulation of various targets, including NOS2, MAPK, and STAT3, by primaryconstituents such as ferulic acid and ursolic acid.","Abulaiti, Kailibinuer, Aikepa, Miheleayi, Ainaidu, Mireguli, Wang, Jiaxin, Yizibula, Maiwulanijiang, Aikemu, Maihesumu",2024,Chinese herbal medicines,1

Control samples were untreated and coated with distilled water. Allsamples were stored for 14 days at 25 ± 1 °C, with quality assessments conductedevery two days. The application of CS-CO treatments was notably effective incontrolling weight loss (3.91-5.26%) and firmness loss (10.81-16.51 N),sustaining the color index score (11.98-16.78), and stabilizing the total solublesolids (4.64-4.71 brix), titratable acidity (0.374-0.383%), total phenoliccontent (75.89-81.54 mg/100 g), ascorbic acid concentration (21.64-33.69 mg/100g), total antioxidant capacity (85.89-91.54%) and pigment levels, particularlychlorophyll (52.80-63.18 mg/100 g), compared to control samples (p < 0.05).Higher CO concentrations (1.0% and 1.5%) in the CS coating maintained asignificant level of phytochemicals in the samples compared to the control group,while CS-CO at 0.5% performed similarly in preserving the other physicochemicalqualities. Both CS and CS-CO treatments extended the shelf life of the tomatoesup to 14 days (<6.78 log10 CFU/mL), whereas control samples were only viable forstorage for 6 days due to higher microbial growth (>7.8 log10 CFU/mL) (p < 0.05).Overall, CS-CO-treated tomatoes demonstrated superior quality preservation andshelf-life enhancement, with a notable improvement in overall qualities ascompared to the CS and control samples.","Venkatachalam, Karthikeyan, Lekjing, Somwang, Noonim, Paramee, Charoenphun, Narin",2024,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",1

Using Ultrasonic-Assisted Extraction.","This study sought to optimize the ultrasonic-assisted extraction of polyphenoliccompounds from unmature Ajwa date seeds (UMS), conduct untargeted metaboliteidentification and assess antioxidant and depigmenting activities. Responsesurface methodology (RSM) utilizing the Box-Behnken design (BBD) and artificialneural network (ANN) modeling was applied to optimize extraction conditions,including the ethanol concentration, extraction temperature and time. Thedetermined optimal conditions comprised the ethanol concentration (62.00%),extraction time (29.00 min), and extraction temperature (50 °C). Under theseconditions, UMS exhibited total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoidcontent (TFC) values of 77.52 ± 1.55 mgGAE/g and 58.85 ± 1.12 mgCE/g,respectively, with low relative standard deviation (RSD%) and relative standarderror (RSE%). High-resolution mass spectrometry analysis unveiled the presence of104 secondary metabolites in UMS, encompassing phenols, flavonoids,sesquiterpenoids, lignans and fatty acids. Furthermore, UMS demonstrated robustantioxidant activities in various cell-free antioxidant assays, implicatingengagement in both hydrogen atom transfer and single electron transfermechanisms. Additionally, UMS effectively mitigated tert-butyl hydroperoxide(t-BHP)-induced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in aconcentration-dependent manner. Crucially, UMS showcased the ability to activatemitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and suppress key proteins includingtyrosinase (Tyr), tyrosinase-related protein-1 and -2 (Trp-1 and -2) andmicrophthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which associated melaninproduction in MNT-1 cell. In summary, this study not only optimized theextraction process for polyphenolic compounds from UMS but also elucidated itsdiverse secondary metabolite profile.

TA054375,10.1038/s41467-024-45090-9,The nature of carotenoid S* state and its role in the nonphotochemical quenchingof plants.,"In plants, light-harvesting complexes serve as antennas to collect and transferthe absorbed energy to reaction centers, but also regulate energy transport bydissipating the excitation energy of chlorophylls. This process, known asnonphotochemical quenching, seems to be activated by conformational changeswithin the light-harvesting complex, but the quenching mechanisms remain elusive.Recent spectroscopic measurements suggest the carotenoid S* dark state as thequencher of chlorophylls' excitation. By investigating lutein embedded indifferent conformations of CP29 (a minor antenna in plants) via nonadiabaticexcited state dynamics simulations, we reveal that different conformations of thecomplex differently stabilize the lutein s-trans conformer with respect to thedominant s-cis one. We show that the s-trans conformer presents the spectroscopicsignatures of the S* state and rationalize its ability to accept energy from theclosest excited chlorophylls, providing thus a relationship between the complex'sconformation and the nonphotochemical quenching.","Accomasso, Davide, Londi, Giacomo, Cupellini, Lorenzo, Mennucci, Benedetta",2024,Nature communications,1

Transepithelialtransport of sodium and chloride ions is important for proper skin function. Sofar, the effect of applying vitamin A preparations to the skin on ion transporthas not been evaluated. In the study, electrophysiological parameters, includingtransepithelial electric potential (PD) and transepithelial resistance (R), ofrabbit skin specimens after 24 h exposure to retinol ointment (800 mass units/g)were measured in a modified Ussing chamber. The R of the fragments incubated withretinol was significantly different than that of the control skin samplesincubated in iso-osmotic Ringer solution. For the controls, the PD values werenegative, whereas the retinol-treated specimens revealed positive PD values.Mechanical-chemical stimulation with the use of inhibitors of the transport ofsodium (amiloride) or chloride (bumetanide) ions revealed specific changes in themaximal and minimal PD values measured for the retinol-treated samples. Retinolwas shown to slightly modify the transport pathways of sodium and chloride ions.In particular, an intensification of the chloride ion secretion fromkeratinocytes was observed.

Recent studieshave shown that PXR is involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, immuneresponse, and energy homeostasis. It is important to identify compounds that maymodulate PXR activity to prevent drug-drug interactions, distinguish chemicalswhich could potentially generate toxicity, and identify compounds for furtherdevelopment towards therapeutic usage. In this study, we have screened theNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) PharmacologicallyActive Chemical Toolbox (NPACT) library, which consists of 5,099 uniquepharmacologically active synthetic and naturally derived small molecules toidentify PXR antagonists. Ninety-four compounds were identified as potential PXRantagonists through a primary screen and 66 were confirmed in a confirmationstudy. Of these compounds, twenty potential PXR antagonists, includinggamma-secretase modulator 2 (GSM2) and fusidic acid, were selected for furtherstudy based on their efficacy, potency, and novelty. Their PXR inhibitionabilities were assessed by examining their effects on cytrochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4mRNA expression using metabolically competent HepaRG cells. Additionally, apharmacological inhibition assay using various concentrations of rifampicin as astimulator was performed in HepG2-CYP3A4-hPXR cells to confirm the activity ofthe 20 selected compounds against PXR. Finally, HepaRG cells were used to confirmPXR antagonism by verification of a concentration-dependent decrease of CYP3A4when co-treated with the known PXR agonist, rifampicin. Additionally, the potentactives were further investigated using molecular docking to find the potentialinteractions of the novel ligands with the active sites of hPXR. To our knowledgefrom the current study, GSM2 and fusidic acid have been identified as novel PXRantagonists, which provides useful information for further investigationregarding possible drug-drug interactions, as well as the detection of potentialtherapeutic effects or other toxic consequences.","Lynch, Caitlin, Margolis, Ryan, Niebler, Jacob, Travers, Jameson, Sakamuru, Srilatha, Zhao, Tongan, Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen, Huang, Ruili, Xia, Menghang",2024,Frontiers in pharmacology,1

Hemp is mostlyused in livestock nutrition as oil or as protein cake, but not as inflorescences.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary hemp inflorescenceson milk yield and composition in grazing dairy goats. Twenty Camosciata delleAlpi goats at their 3rd parity and with a mean body weight of 45.2 ± 2.0 kg,immediately after kidding, were equally allocated into two groups (G: Grazing andGH: grazing and hemp). For three months, all goats were fed on a permanentpasture and received 700/head/day of concentrate; diet of group GH wassupplemented with 20 g/head/day of hemp inflorescences. Goats' body weight didnot change during the trial. Individual milk yield was daily recorded and samplescollected every 20 days for chemical composition and fatty acid profile analysis.No significant differences were found for milk yield and chemical composition.Caproic (C6:0) (1.80 vs. 1.74%; p < 0.01) and lauric acids (C12:0) weresignificantly higher in milk of group GH (4.83 vs. 4.32%; p < 0.01) as well aslinoleic (C18:2) (2.04 vs. 1.93%; p < 0.05), adrenic acid (C22:4) (0.046 vs.0.031%, p < 0.05), omega-6/omega-3 ratio (3.17 vs. 2.93, p < 0.05) and totalconjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) (0.435 vs. 0.417%; p < 0.01).

TA054551,10.1111/nph.20271,Unravelling the different components of nonphotochemical quenching using a novelanalytical pipeline.,"Photoprotection in plants includes processes collectively known asnonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), which quench excess excitation-energy inphotosystem II. NPQ is triggered by acidification of the thylakoid lumen, whichleads to PsbS-protein protonation and violaxanthin de-epoxidase activation,resulting in zeaxanthin accumulation. Despite extensive study, questions persistabout the mechanisms of NPQ. We have set up a novel analytical pipeline todisentangle NPQ induction curves measured at many light intensities into alimited number of different kinetic components. To validate the method, weapplied it to Chl-fluorescence measurements, which utilised the saturating-pulsemethodology, on wild-type (wt) and zeaxanthin-lacking (npq1) Arabidopsis thalianaplants. NPQ induction curves in wt and npq1 can be explained by four components (α , β , γ and δ ). The fastest two ( β and γ ) correlate with pH differenceformed across the thylakoid membrane in wt and npq1. In wt, the slower component( α ) appears to be due to the formation of zeaxanthin-related quenching whilstfor npq1, this component is 'replaced' by a slower component ( δ ), whichreflects a photoinhibition-like process that appears in the absence ofzeaxanthin-induced quenching. Expanding this approach will allow the effects ofmutations and other abiotic-stress factors to be directly probed by changes inthese underlying components.","Ramakers, Lennart A I, Harbinson, Jeremy, Wientjes, Emilie, van Amerongen, Herbert",2025,The New phytologist,1

One wayto achieve this is by using plant growth regulators as a tool for plant growthmanagement. In a greenhouse with a mist irrigation system, a study was conductedon dwarf schefflera, an ornamental foliage plant, which was exposed to foliarapplication of gibberellic acid and benzyladenine hormones. The hormones weresprayed on dwarf schefflera leaves at 0, 100, and 200 mg/l concentrations, at15-day intervals in three stages. The experiment was conducted as a factorialbased on a completely randomized design, with four replicates. The combination ofgibberellic acid and benzyladenine at 200 mg/l concentration had a significanteffect on leaf number, leaf area, and plant height. The treatment also resultedin the highest content of photosynthetic pigments. Furthermore, the highestsoluble carbohydrate to reducing sugars ratio was observed in treatments of 100and 200 mg/l benzyladenine, and 200 mg/l gibberellic acid + benzyladenine.Stepwise regression analysis showed that root volume was the first variable toenter the model, explaining 44% of variations. The next variable was root freshweight, and the two-variable model explained 63% of variations in leaf number.The greatest positive effect on leaf number was related to root fresh weight(0.43), which had a positive correlation with leaf number (0.47).

TA054682,10.3389/fnut.2024.1484257,Widely targeted metabolomics and SPME-GC-MS analysis revealed the qualitycharacteristics of non-volatile/volatile compounds in Zheng'an Bai tea.,"BACKGROUND: As albino tea under the geographical protection of agriculturalproducts, Zheng'an Bai tea is not only rich in amino acids, polyphenols and otherbeneficial components for the human body, but also its leaf color will turn greenas the temperature gradually rises, thus causing changes in the qualitycharacteristics of tea leaves. However, these changing characteristics have notyet been revealed. METHODS: In-depth quality analysis was carried out on thefresh leaves of Zheng'an Bai tea at four different developmental stages and foursamples from the processing stage through extensive targeted metabolomics andSPME-GC-MS analysis. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 573 non-volatilemetabolites were detected from the fresh leaves and processing samples ofZheng'an Bai tea, mainly including 96 flavonoids, 75 amino acids, 56 sugars andalcohols, 48 terpenoids, 46 organic acids, 44 alkaloids, and 39 polyphenols andtheir derivatives. In fresh leaves, the most significant differential metabolites(VIP > 1, p < 0.05) among different samples mainly include substances such asethyl gallate, theaflavin, isovitexin and linalool, while the main differentialmetabolites of samples in the processing stage include alkaloids, polyphenols andflavonoids such as zarzissine, methyl L-Pyroglutamate, theaflavin 3,3'-digallate,euscaphic acid and ethyl gallate. Overall, substances such as sugars andalcohols, alkaloids and polyphenols show the greatest differences between freshleaves and the processing process. Meanwhile, 97 kinds of volatile metaboliteswere detected in these samples, most of which had a higher content in the freshleaves. Moderate spreading is conducive to the release of the aroma of tealeaves, but fixation causes a sharp decrease in the content of most volatilemetabolites. Ultimately, 9 volatile substances including geraniol, linalool,nerolidol, jasmone, octanal, 1-Nonanal, heptaldehyde, methyl salicylate and1-Octen-3-ol were identified as the key aroma components (OAV >1) of Zheng'an Baitea. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study has for the first time comprehensivelyrevealed the quality change characteristics of fresh leaves at differentdevelopmental stages and during the processing of Zheng'an Bai tea, and provideda foundation for further process improvement.","Liu, Li, Qiao, Dahe, Mi, Xiaozeng, Yu, Shirui, Jing, Tingting, An, Yanlin",2024,Frontiers in nutrition,1

TA054819,10.1186/s12906-024-04356-x,Network pharmacology and in vivo evidence of the pharmacological mechanism ofgeniposide in the treatment of atherosclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis (AS) is a fundamental pathological state in variouscardiovascular diseases. Geniposide, which is the main active component ofGardenia jasminides, is effective against AS. However, the underlying molecularmechanisms remain unclear. Here, we sought to elucidate them. METHODS: Thetargets of AS and geniposide were collected from online public databases. Thepotential mechanism of Geniposide in treating AS was predicted by constructing aprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network and conducting Gene Ontology (GO) andKyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. Hubproteins and core pathways were verified by molecular docking and in vivoexperiments. Moreover, the effect of geniposide on AS was assessed by measuringthe atherosclerotic plaque area in the thoracic aorta of mice. ApoE(-/-) micewere used to establish AS models and randomly divided into different groups. Twodifferent doses of geniposide were administered to the mice. Hematoxylin andeosin (HE) staining was performed to evaluate the effects of geniposide on AS.Oil Red O and Sirius Red staining were used to evaluate plaque stability. Theprotein expression of key markers involved in the signalling pathways wasexamined using western blotting and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: A total of 239active targets, 3418 AS-related disease targets, and 129 overlapping targets wereidentified. Hub genes were detected, and molecular docking revealed thatgeniposide strongly interacted with hub proteins (AKT1, VEGFA, CTNNB1, MMP9, andEGFR). Moreover, 109 signalling pathways, including the Rap1 signalling pathway,were identified using enrichment analysis. The results of in vivo experimentsdemonstrated that geniposide reduced body weight and blood lipid levels,alleviated the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, enhanced plaque stability,and inhibited inflammation, at least partially, by activating the Rap1/PI3K/Aktsignalling pathway in ApoE(-/-) mice. CONCLUSION: Geniposide can alleviate AS andenhance the stability of atherosclerotic plaques by regulating the Rap1/PI3K/Aktsignalling pathway.","Ma, Guiping, Dong, Qinqin, Li, Feng, Jin, Zheng, Pi, Jianbin, Wu, Wei, Li, Junlong",2024,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,1

This study examined whether dietarysupplementation with microalgae extracts from PT containing 4.4 mg/d offucoxanthin affects changes in body composition or health markers in overweightwomen during an exercise and diet intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of37 females (28.6 ± 7.9 years, 80.2 ± 14.9 kg, 29.6 ± 3.8 kg/m², 41.4 ± 4.2% fat)fasted for 12 h, donated a fasting blood sample, completed health and mood stateinventories, and undertook body composition, health, and exercise assessments. Ina counterbalanced, randomized, and double-blind manner, participants ingested aplacebo (PL), or microalgae extract of Phaeodactylum tricornutum standardized to4.4 mg of fucoxanthin (FX) for 12 weeks while participating in a supervisedexercise program that included resistance-training and walking (3 days/week) withencouragement to accumulate 10,000 steps/day on remaining days of the week. Thediet intervention involved reducing energy intake by about -300 kcal/d (i.e.,≈1400-1600 kcals/d, 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein) to promote a -500kcal/d energy deficit with exercise. Follow-up testing was performed at 6 and 12weeks. A general linear model (GLM) with repeated measures statistical analysiswas used to analyze group responses and changes from baseline with 95% confidenceintervals. RESULTS: Dietary supplementation with microalgae extract from PTcontaining fucoxanthin for 12 weeks did not promote additional weight loss or fatloss in overweight but otherwise healthy females initiating an exercise and dietintervention designed to promote modest weight loss. However, fucoxanthinsupplementation preserved bone mass, increased bone density, and saw greaterimprovements in walking steps/day, resting heart rate, aerobic capacity, bloodlipid profiles, adherence to diet goals, functional activity tolerance, andmeasures of quality of life.

TA054969,10.3390/ijms25126782,The First In Vivo Study Shows That Gyrophoric Acid Changes Behavior of HealthyLaboratory Rats.,"Gyrophoric acid (GA), a lichen secondary metabolite, has attracted more attentionduring the last years because of its potential biological effects. Until now, itseffect in vivo has not yet been demonstrated. The aim of our study was toevaluate the basic physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of GA, whichare directly associated with its biological activities. The stability of the GAin various pH was assessed by conducting repeated UV-VIS spectral measurements.Microsomal stability in rat liver microsomes was performed usingUltra-Performance LC/MS. Binding to human serum albumin (HSA) was assessed usingsynchronous fluorescence spectra, and molecular docking analysis was used toreveal the binding site of GA to HSA. In the in vivo experiment, 24Sprague-Dawley rats (Velaz, Únetice, Czech Republic) were used. The animals weredivided as follows. The first group (n = 6) included healthy males as controlintact rats (♂INT), and the second group (n = 6) included healthy females ascontrols (♀INT). Groups three and four (♂GA/n = 6 and ♀GA/n = 6) consisted ofanimals with daily administered GA (10 mg/kg body weight) in an ethanol-watersolution per os for a one-month period. We found that GA remained stable undervarious pH and temperature conditions. It bonded to human serum albumin with thebinding constant 1.788 × 10(6) dm(3)mol(-1) to reach the target tissue via thismechanism. In vivo, GA did not influence body mass gain, food, or fluid intakeduring the experiment. No liver toxicity was observed. However, GA increased therearing frequency in behavioral tests (p < 0.01) and center crossings in theelevated plus-maze (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the timespent in the open arm was prolonged (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively).Notably, GA was able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, indicating itsability to permeate into the brain and to stimulate neurogenesis in the hilus andsubgranular zone of the hippocampus.

Plants.,"Stress modifiers are recognized as biostimulants providing beneficial effects onvarious plant species. However, the specific potential of modulators such asmelatonin, chitosan, humic acid, and selenium in enhancing the resistance ofajwain (Carum copticum L.) plants to water scarcity remains an open question. Toaddress this knowledge gap, we conducted a randomized, field block-designedfactorial experiment over two years (2022-2023) to compare the effectiveness ofthese biostimulants in mitigating the impact of water shortage on ajwain plants.This study involved three irrigation regimes: 100% field water capacity(FC100%-unstressed), 75% irrigation deficit (FC75%-moderate) and 50% irrigationdeficit (FC50%-severe), and four modifier treatments (melatonin, chitosan, humicacid, selenium), plus untreated controls. Plant growth, seed yields, essentialoil production, as well as eco-physiological traits were studied to assess theefficacy of these compounds as stress modulators. Water regimes and stressmodifier applications, as a single factor or in synergy, significantly affectedplant physiology and seed yield, highlighting the importance of sustainability inagricultural practices. Compared to FC100%, biological and seed yield,chlorophyll, and nutrient content decreased under FC75% and FC50%, whileessential oil production, proline, soluble sugars, flavonoids, phenols andantioxidant enzymatic activity increased. Notably, regardless of the type ofmodulator used, the application of these modifiers improved all physiologicalattributes under moderate and severe irrigation deficits. Among the involvedcompounds, melatonin induced the most pronounced effects, leading to higherbiological and seed yield, essential and fixed oil production, relative leafwater content, chlorophyll and nutrient concentration, and antioxidant activity.Our results demonstrate that such compounds effectively function as stressmodulators against water scarcity in ajwain plants by preserving specificeco-physiological traits and promoting water saving. These findings providevaluable insights into their use as a nature-based solution for addressing waterstress in sustainable agriculture and climate change challenges.","Heydarzadeh, Saeid, Tobeh, Ahmad, Jahanbakhsh, Sodabeh, Farzaneh, Salim, Vitale, Ermenegilda, Arena, Carmen",2024,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",1

The sex determination of Dendroctonus armandi plays a significant rolein the reproduction of its population. In recent years, the role of the fem-1gene in sex determination in other insects has been reported. However, thefunction and expression of the fem-1 gene in Dendroctonus armandi remainuncertain. In this study, three fem-1 genes were cloned and characterized. Thesewere named Dafem-1A, Dafem-1B, and Dafem-1C, respectively. The expression levelsof these three Dafem-1 genes vary at different stages of development and betweenthe sexes. In response to different environmental treatments, includingtemperature, nutrients, terpenoids, and feeding duration, significant differenceswere observed between the three Dafem-1 genes at different developmental stagesand between males and females. Furthermore, injection of double-stranded RNA(dsRNA) targeting the expressions of the Dafem-1A, Dafem-1B, and Dafem-1C genesresulted in increased mortality, deformity, and decreased emergence rates, aswell as an imbalance in the sex ratio. Following the interference with Dafem-1Aand Dafem-1C, no notable difference was observed in the expression of theDafem-1B gene. Similarly, after the interference with the Dafem-1B gene, nosignificant difference was evident in the expression levels of the Dafem-1A andDafem-1C genes. However, the interference of either the Dafem-1A or Dafem-1C generesults in the downregulation of the other gene. The aforementioned resultsdemonstrate that the Dafem-1A, Dafem-1B, and Dafem-1C genes play a pivotal rolein the regulation of life development and sex determination. Furthermore, it canbe concluded that external factors such as temperature, nutrition, terpenoids,and feeding have a significant impact on the expression levels of the Dafem-1A,Dafem-1B, and Dafem-1C genes. This provides a crucial theoretical foundation forfurther elucidating the sex determination mechanism of Dendroctonus armandi.","Wang, Jiajin, Liao, Songkai, Lin, Haoyu, Wei, Hongjian, Mao, Xinjie, Wang, Qi, Chen, Hui",2024,International journal of molecular sciences,1

Baccharisdracunculifolia DC (Asteraceae), a Brazilian edible plant, is an important sourceof active compounds with anti-inflammatory abilities. Thus, we evaluated itsability to reverse OA-induced nociceptive and emotional-like impairments inosteoarthritic ovariectomized female rats using the kaolin/carrageenan (K/C)model. Four weeks after OA induction, mechanical hyperalgesia was confirmed, andthe treatment started. Control animals (SHAMs) were treated withphosphate-buffered saline (PBS), while arthritic animals (ARTHs) either receivedPBS or B. dracunculifolia 50 mg/kg (Bd50) and 100 mg/kg (Bd100), via gavage,daily for five weeks.

It is highly regarded for its medicinal properties,particularly in treating respiratory infections and inflammatory conditions, aswell as boosting the human immune system. However, a lack of genomic informationhas hindered research on the functional genomics and potential improvements of H.cordata. In this study, we present a near-complete assembly of H. cordata genomeand investigate the biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids, specifically quercetin,using genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics analyses. The genome of H.cordata diverged from that of Saururus chinensis around 33.4 million years ago;it consists of 2.24 Gb with 76 chromosomes (4n = 76) and has undergone threewhole-genome duplication (WGD) events. These WGDs played a crucial role inshaping the H. cordata genome and influencing the gene families associated withits medicinal properties. Through metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, weidentified key genes involved in the β-oxidation process for biosynthesis ofhouttuynin, one of the volatile oils responsible for the plant's fishy smell. Inaddition, using the reference genome, we identified genes involved in flavonoidbiosynthesis, particularly quercetin metabolism, in H. cordata. This discoveryhas important implications for understanding the regulatory mechanisms thatunderlie production of active pharmaceutical ingredients in traditional Chinesemedicine. Overall, the high-quality genome assembly of H. cordata serves as avaluable resource for future functional genomics research and provides a solidfoundation for genetic improvement of H. cordata for the benefit of human health.","Yang, Zhengting, He, Fayin, Mai, Yingxiao, Fan, Sixian, An, Yin, Li, Kun, Wu, Fengqi, Tang, Ming, Yu, Hui, Liu, Jian-Xiang, Xia, Rui",2024,Plant communications,1

In tree buds, low-temperature conditions (LT) induce a switchin plasmodesmata from a closed to an open state, which restores cell-to-cellcommunication in the shoot apex and releases dormancy. Using genetic andcell-biological approaches, we have identified a previously uncharacterizedtranscription factor, Low-temperature-Induced MADS-box 1 (LIM1), as anLT-induced, direct upstream activator of the gibberellic acid (GA) pathway. TheLIM1-GA module mediates low temperature-induced plasmodesmata opening, bynegatively regulating callose accumulation to promote dormancy release. LIM1 alsoactivates expression of FT1 (FLOWERING LOCUS T), another LT-induced factor, withLIM1-FT1 forming a coherent feedforward loop converging on low-temperatureregulation of gibberellin signaling in dormancy release.

TA055210,10.1186/s12885-023-11792-4,"A randomised phase II trial of temozolomide with or without cannabinoids inpatients with recurrent glioblastoma (ARISTOCRAT): protocol for a multi-centre,double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult malignant brain tumour,with an incidence of 5 per 100,000 per year in England. Patients with tumoursshowing O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylationrepresent around 40% of newly diagnosed GBM. Relapse/tumour recurrence isinevitable. There is no agreed standard treatment for patients with GBM,therefore, it is aimed at delaying further tumour progression and maintaininghealth-related quality of life (HRQoL). Limited clinical trial data exist usingcannabinoids in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) in this setting, but earlyphase data demonstrate prolonged overall survival compared to TMZ alone, with fewadditional side effects. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (previously GW Pharma Ltd.) havedeveloped nabiximols (trade name Sativex®), an oromucosal spray containing ablend of cannabis plant extracts, that we aim to assess for preliminary efficacyin patients with recurrent GBM. METHODS: ARISTOCRAT is a phase II, multi-centre,double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial to assess cannabinoids inpatients with recurrent MGMT methylated GBM who are suitable for treatment withTMZ. Patients who have relapsed ≥ 3 months after completion of initial first-linetreatment will be randomised 2:1 to receive either nabiximols or placebo incombination with TMZ. The primary outcome is overall survival time defined as thetime in whole days from the date of randomisation to the date of death from anycause. Secondary outcomes include overall survival at 12 months, progression-freesurvival time, HRQoL (using patient reported outcomes from QLQ-C30, QLQ-BN20 andEQ-5D-5L questionnaires), and adverse events. DISCUSSION: Patients with recurrentMGMT promoter methylated GBM represent a relatively good prognosis sub-group ofpatients with GBM. However, their median survival remains poor and, therefore,more effective treatments are needed. The phase II design of this trial waschosen, rather than phase III, due to the lack of data currently available oncannabinoid efficacy in this setting. A randomised, double-blind,placebo-controlled trial will ensure an unbiased robust evaluation of thetreatment and will allow potential expansion of recruitment into a phase IIItrial should the emerging phase II results warrant this development.

The prevalent group of compounds in all the beersanalysed were alcohols (56.41-72.17%), followed by esters (14.58-20.82%),aldehydes (8.35-20.52%), terpenes and terpenoids (1.22-6.57%) and ketones(0.42-1.00%). The dominant higher alcohols were 2-methylpropan-1-ol,3-methylbutanol, phenethyl alcohol, among aldehydes furfural, decanal, nonanal,and among esters ethyl acetate, phenylethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate. Beersfermented by the top-fermenting yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. diastaticushad the highest volatile content. The addition of dark malt in wort productionprocess had no effect on the total content of volatiles, but for some beers itcaused changes in the total content of esters, terpenes and terpenoids.Variations in the total volatile content between beers fermentedby different yeast strains are mainly due to esters and alcohols identified.Sensory analysis of beers allowed us to identify the characteristics affected bythe addition of dark speciality malts in the production of wort and yeast strainsused in the fermentation process.","Paszkot, Justyna, Gasiński, Alan, Kawa-Rygielska, Joanna",2023,Scientific reports,1

Therefore, this presented study aimed to assessthe antioxidant activity of the leaves of selected hemp cultivars, such asBiałobrzeska, Tygra, and Henola, based on the results obtained with the2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, ferric reducing antioxidantpower, cupric reducing antioxidant capacity, and 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazylassays. The cannabinoid profile was analysed for the antioxidant activity to thecontents of cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol(Δ(9)-THC), and cannabichromene (CBC), determined based on chromatographicassays. The following variables were tested: the impact of various extractants(methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol), and their mixtures (50:50, v/v, as well asextraction methods (maceration and ultra-sound-assisted extraction) significantin obtaining hemp extracts characterised by different cannabinoid profiles. Theresults revealed that the selection of extractant and extraction conditionssignificantly influenced the active compounds' extraction efficiency andantioxidant activity. Among the tested conditions, ultrasound-assisted extractionusing methanol yielded the highest cannabinoid profile: CBD = 184.51 ± 5.61; CBG= 6.10 ± 0.21; Δ9-THC = 0.51 ± 0.01; and CBC = 0.71 ± 0.01 μg/g antioxidantpotential in Białobrzeska leaf extracts.","Stasiłowicz-Krzemień, Anna, Sip, Szymon, Szulc, Piotr, Cielecka-Piontek, Judyta",2023,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",1

PPL grows on conifers, while PCY grows on broad-leaved trees.To reveal the genetic mechanism behind PPL's adaptability to conifers, weperformed de novo genome sequencing and comparative analysis of PPL and PCY. Wedetermined the size of the genomes for PPL and PCY to be 36.12 and 42.74 Mb,respectively, and found that they contain 10,851 and 15,673 protein-coding genes,accounting for 59.34% and 53.70% of their respective genome sizes. Evolutionanalysis showed PPL was closely related to P. ostreatus with the divergence timeof 62.7 MYA, while PCY was distantly related to other Pleurotus species with thedivergence time of 111.7 MYA. Comparative analysis of carbohydrate-active enzymes(CAZYmes) in PPL and PCY showed that the increase number of CAZYmes related topectin and cellulose degradation (e.g., AA9, PL1) in PPL may be important for thedegradation and colonization of conifers. In addition, geraniol degradation andperoxisome pathways identified by comparative genomes should be another factorsfor PPL's tolerance to conifer substrate. Our research provides valuable genomesfor Pleurotus species and sheds light on the genetic mechanism of PPL's coniferadaptability, which could aid in breeding new Pleurotus varieties for coniferousutilization.","Sun, Lei, Yin, Xiaolei, Sossah, Frederick Leo, Han, Xuerong, Li, Yu",2023,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,1
TA055386,10.1073/pnas.2307012120,Dynamic changes to the plant cuticle include the production of volatile cuticularwax-derived compounds.,"The cuticle is a hydrophobic structure that seals plant aerial surfaces from thesurrounding environment. To better understand how cuticular wax compositionchanges over development, we conducted an untargeted screen of leaf surfacelipids from black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). We observed major shifts tothe lipid profile across development, from a phenolic and terpene-dominatedprofile in young leaves to an aliphatic wax-dominated profile in mature leaves.Contrary to the general pattern, levels of aliphatic cis-9-alkenes decreased inolder leaves following their accumulation. A thorough examination revealed thatthe decrease in cis-9-alkenes was accompanied by a concomitant increase inaldehydes, one of them being the volatile compound nonanal. By applying exogenousalkenes to P. trichocarpa leaves, we show that unsaturated waxes in the cuticleundergo spontaneous oxidative cleavage to generate aldehydes and that thisprocess occurs similarly in other alkene-accumulating systems such as balsampoplar (Populus balsamifera) leaves and corn (Zea mays) silk. Moreover, we showthat the production of cuticular wax-derived compounds can be extended to otherwax components. In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum),9-hydroxy-14,16-hentriacontanedione likely decomposes to generate 2-heptadecanoneand 7-octyloxepan-2-one (a caprolactone). These findings highlight an unusualroute to the production of plant volatiles that are structurally encoded withincuticular wax precursors. These processes could play a role in modulatingecological interactions and open the possibility for engineering bioactivevolatile compounds into plant waxes.","Chen, Jeff Y, Kuruparan, Aswini, Zamani-Babgohari, Mahbobeh, Gonzales-Vigil, Eliana",2023,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1

Increasingevidence suggests that beneficial microorganisms (BMs) may be used as plantbiostimulants and pest biocontrol agents. We investigated whether tomato (Solanumlycopersicum) plants are thoroughly colonized by the endophytic andentomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, and how such colonization affectsphysiological parameters and the phenotype of plants grown under unstressedconditions or exposed to the pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea. As a positivecontrol, a strain of the well-known biocontrol agent and growth inducerTrichoderma afroharzianum was used. As multitrophic interactions are often drivenby (or have consequences on) volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by plantsconstitutively or after induction by abiotic or biotic stresses, VOC emissionswere also studied. Both B. bassiana and T. afroharzianum induced a significantbut transient (one to two-day-long) reduction of stomatal conductance, which mayindicate rapid activation of defensive (rejection) responses, but also limitedphotosynthesis. At later stages, our results demonstrated a successful andcomplete plant colonization by B. bassiana, which induced higher photosynthesisand lower respiration rates, improved growth of roots, stems, leaves, earlierflowering, higher number of fruits and yield in tomato plants. Beauveria bassianaalso helped tomato plants fight B. cinerea, whose symptoms in leaves were almostentirely relieved with respect to control plants. Less VOCs were emitted whenplants were colonized by B. bassiana or infected by B. cinerea, alone or incombination, suggesting no activation of VOC-dependent defensive mechanisms inresponse to both fungi.","Russo, Assunta, Winkler, Jana Barbro, Ghirardo, Andrea, Monti, Maurilia M, Pollastri, Susanna, Ruocco, Michelina, Schnitzler, Jörg-Peter, Loreto, Francesco",2023,Frontiers in plant science,1

Toremedy this situation, several national organizations are working to createtechnological platforms for small producers to certify the quality of theirbeans. The objective of this study was to identify differential chemical markersin 36 cocoa bean samples from five Colombian departments and associate them withcocoa quality properties. For this purpose, a non-targeted metabolomics approachwas performed using UHPLC-HRMS, along with sensory and physicochemical analyses.The 36 samples did not differ in sensory quality, polyphenol content, andtheobromine/caffeine ratio. However, the multivariate statistical analysisallowed us to differentiate the samples into four clusters. In addition, asimilar grouping of the samples was also observed in the physical analyses. Themetabolites responsible for such clustering were investigated with univariatestatistical analysis and presumptively identified by comparison of experimentalmass spectra with those reported in databases. Alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids,peptides, quinolines, and sulfur compounds were identified as discriminantsbetween sample groups. Here, it was presented the metabolic profiles as animportant chemical feature for further studies in quality control and morespecific characterization of fine cocoa.","Bacca-Villota, Paula, Acuña-García, Luis, Sierra-Guevara, Leidy, Cano, Herminsul, Hidalgo, William",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

However, lower sensory evaluation scores were obtained inthe pectinase-treated guava juices. Aldehydes and terpenoids were the main flavorcomponents in the guava juices, which were responsible for the aroma of thejuice, while their relative contents were different in the four cultivar guavajuices. Furthermore, pectinase treatment could change the amounts and relativecontents of volatile compounds in the guava juice. During the pectinase treatmentprocess, the relative contents of the main aroma constituents in the guava juiceswere significantly decreased.

In this study, weutilized 212 peach germplasm resources from the Nanjing Peach ResourceRepository, National Fruit Germplasm facility, Jiangsu Academy of AgriculturalSciences as materials for sensory analysis, electronic nose analysis, andcomposition analysis via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In thesensory analysis, we divided 212 peach germplasms into three clusters based onhierarchical cluster analysis (d = 5). No.27, No.151, and No.46 emerged as themost representative of these clusters. The electronic nose was used to conduct anevaluation of the aroma profiles of the 212 peach germplasms, revealing that theprimary distinguishing factors of peach aroma can be attributed to three sensors:W1S (methane), W1W (terpenes and organosulfur compounds), and W5S (hydrocarbonsand aromatic compounds). The primary differences in the aromatic substances werecharacterized by sensors W2W (aromatic compounds, sulphur, and chlorinecompounds) and W1C (aromatic benzene). The HPLC analysis indicated that thepersistence of peach sensory characteristics was positively correlated with acidsand sourness and negatively correlated with sweetness and the ratio of sugar toacids. The overall impression of the 212 peach germplasms revealed a negativecorrelation with acids, while a positive correlation was observed between theoverall impression and the ratio of sugar to acids. Therefore, this studysubstantially contributes to the preliminary screening of the analysed specificcharacteristics of peach germplasms such as No.27, No.46, No.151, and No.211.These selections may provide valuable information for the potential creation ofsuperior germplasm resources.","Sun, Meng, Ma, Julin, Cai, Zhixiang, Yan, Juan, Ma, Ruijuan, Yu, Mingliang, Xie, Yinfeng, Shen, Zhijun",2023,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",1

In this study, weinvestigated a distinct subgeneric taxon of Xylaria (Xylariaceae), namedPseudoxylaria, whose members have solely been isolated from the fungus garden offarming termites. Pseudoxylaria are inconspicuously present in active fungusgardens of termite colonies and only emerge in the form of vegetative stromata,when the fungus comb is no longer attended (""sit and wait"" strategy). Insightsinto the genomic and metabolic consequences of their association, however, haveremained sparse. Capitalizing on viable Pseudoxylaria cultures from differenttermite colonies, we obtained genomes of seven and transcriptomes of twoPseudoxylaria isolates. Using a whole-genome-based comparison with free-livingmembers of the genus Xylaria, we document that the association has beenaccompanied by significant reductions in genome size, protein-coding genecontent, and reduced functional capacities related to oxidative lignindegradation, oxidative stress responses and secondary metabolite production.Functional studies based on growth assays and fungus-fungus co-cultivations,coupled with isotope fractionation analysis, showed that Pseudoxylaria onlymoderately antagonizes growth of the termite food fungus Termitomyces, andinstead extracts nutrients from the food fungus biomass for its own growth.

TheEO-added films were found to significantly improve the overall colorcharacteristics (lightness, redness, and yellowness) as compared to the controlfilm. The control films had higher opacity, while the EO-added films had slightlyreduced levels of opacity and produced clearer films. The tensile strength andelongation at break values of the films varied among the samples. The controlsamples had the highest tensile strength, followed by the turmeric EO-addedsamples. However, the highest elongation at break value was found in the galangaland garlic EO-added films. The Young's modulus results showed that garlic EO andkaffir lime EO had the lowest stiffness values. The total moisture content andwater vapor permeability were very low in the garlic EO-added films. Despite thedifferences in EOs, the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) patternsof the tested films were similar among each other. Microstructural observation ofthe surface and cross-section of the tested edible film exhibited smooth andfissureless patterns, especially in the EO-added films, particularly in thegalangal and kaffir lime EO-added films. The antimicrobial activity of theEO-added films was highly efficient against various gram-positive andgram-negative pathogens. Among the EO-added films, the garlic and galangalEO-added films exhibited superior inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli,Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, andPseudomonas fluorescence, and turmeric and kaffir lime EO-added films showedpotential antimicrobial activity against Lactobacillus plantarum and L.monocytogenes.

In this study, transcriptome andproteome sequencing were performed on upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)variety under salt stress, and integrated analysis was carried out to exploitsalt-tolerance genes in cotton. Enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) andKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was performed on differentiallyexpressed genes (DEGs) obtained from transcriptome and proteome sequencing. GOenrichment was carried out mainly in the cell membrane, organelle, cellularprocess, metabolic process, and stress response. The expression of 23,981 geneswas changed in physiological and biochemical processes such as cell metabolism.The metabolic pathways obtained by KEGG enrichment included glycerolipidmetabolism, sesquiterpene and triterpenoid biosynthesis, flavonoid production,and plant hormone signal transduction. Combined transcriptome and proteomeanalysis to screen and annotate DEGs yielded 24 candidate genes with significantdifferential expression. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) validation of the candidate genes showed that two genes (Gh_D11G0978and Gh_D10G0907) responded significantly to the induction of NaCl, and these twogenes were further selected as target genes for gene cloning and functionalvalidation through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). The silenced plantsexhibited early wilting with a greater degree of salt damage under salttreatment. Moreover, they showed higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)than the control. Therefore, we can infer that these two genes have a pivotalrole in the response to salt stress in upland cotton. The findings in thisresearch will facilitate the breeding of salt tolerance cotton varieties that canbe grown on saline alkaline lands.","Sun, Kangtai, Mehari, Teame Gereziher, Fang, Hui, Han, Jinlei, Huo, Xuehan, Zhang, Jingxia, Chen, Yu, Wang, Dongmei, Zhuang, Zhimin, Ditta, Allah, Khan, Muhammad K R, Zhang, Jun, Wang, Kai, Wang, Baohua",2023,Frontiers in plant science,1

The current study evaluated the anti-candida effectsof silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized from an aqueous extract of C.citratus against different Candida spp. The aqueous extract was prepared from thefresh leaves of C. citratus. The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were prepared andvalidated by UV spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),transmission electron microscope (TEM), and zeta size analysis. C. albicans, C.krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. famata, C. rhodotorula, and C.glabrata were used in the antifungal assay. Microscopical imaging were used toinvestigate the different morphological changes induced by treatment. FTIRspectrum confirmed the existence of various functional groups of biomoleculescapping the nanoparticles. The average particle size of synthesized AgNPs was100.6 nm by zeta-sizer and 0.012 to 0.059 mm by TEM. In the antifungal assay,AgNPs aggregates induced significant inhibition of the growth of all species (p <0.05) compared to the control and the biofilm maturation in C. famata and C.albicans. These considerable antifungal activities might lead to the developmentof appropriate alternative remedy for the treatment of fungal infections.","Al-Otibi, Fatimah, Albulayhid, Luluwah S, Alharbi, Raedah I, Almohsen, Atheer A, AlShowiman, Ghada M",2023,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",1

Despite the availabilityof various treatment options, FM remains a challenging condition to manage. Inthe present study, we investigated the efficacy of formulated nanodispersions oflutein and beta-carotene in treating FM-related symptoms induced by reserpine infemale Wistar rats. Several techniques have been implemented to assess thisefficacy at various levels, including biochemical, bioelectrical, and behavioral.Namely, oxidative stress markers, monoamine levels, electrocorticography, painthreshold test, and open field test were conducted on control, FM-induced, andFM-treated groups of animals. Our results provided compelling evidence for theefficacy of carotenoid nanodispersions in treating FM-related symptoms.Specifically, we found that the dual action of the nanodispersion, as bothantioxidant and antidepressant, accounted for their beneficial effects intreating FM.

Grafting techniques are widelyutilized in apple production to keep the varieties pure. Interstocks arefrequently used in Northern China to achieve intensive apple dwarfingcultivation. High-throughput sequencing was used to investigate differentiallyexpressed genes in the phloem tissues of two different xenograft systems, M('Gala'/'Mac 9'/Malus baccata (L.) Borkh.) and B ('Gala'/Malus baccata (L.)Borkh.). The results showed that dwarfing interstocks could significantly reducethe height and diameters of apple trees while have few effects on the growth ofannual branches. The interstocks were found to regulate the expression of genesrelated to hormone metabolism and tree body control (GH3.9, PIN1, CKI1, ARP1,GA2ox1 and GA20ox1), these effects may attribute the dwarf characters for appletrees with interstocks. Besides, the interstocks reduce photosynthesis-relatedgenes (MADH-ME4 and GAPC), promote carbon (C) metabolism gene expression (AATP1,GDH and PFK3), promote the expression of nitrogen (N)-metabolism-related genes(NRT2.7, NADH and GDH) in rootstocks, and improve the expression of genes relatedto secondary metabolism in scions (DX5, FPS1, TPS21 and SRG1). We also concludedthat the interstocks acquired early blooming traits due to promotion of theexpression of flowering genes in the scion (MOF1, FTIP7, AGL12 and AGL24). Thisstudy is a valuable resource regarding the molecular mechanisms of dwarfinterstocks' influence on various biological processes and transplantationsystems in both scions and rootstocks.","Li, Qingshan, Gao, Yuan, Wang, Kun, Feng, Jianrong, Sun, Simiao, Lu, Xiang, Liu, Zhao, Zhao, Deying, Li, Lianwen, Wang, Dajiang",2023,International journal of molecular sciences,1

Genomicresource enhancement of this genus can help to reveal early monocot genomicarchitecture and evolution. Here, we assemble the genome of Acorus gramineus andreveal that it has ~45% fewer genes than the majority of monocots, although theyhave similar genome size. Phylogenetic analyses based on both chloroplast andnuclear genes consistently support that A. gramineus is the sister to theremaining monocots. In addition, we assemble a 2.2 Mb mitochondrial genome andobserve many genes exhibit higher mutation rates than that of most angiosperms,which could be the reason leading to the controversies of nuclear genes- andmitochondrial genes-based phylogenetic trees existing in the literature. Further,Acorales did not experience tau (τ) whole-genome duplication, unlike majority ofmonocot clades, and no large-scale gene expansion is observed. Moreover, weidentify gene contractions and expansions likely linking to plant architecture,stress resistance, light harvesting, and essential oil metabolism.

Here, we show thatVvDELLA2 directly regulates the activity of the VvCEB1 transcription factor, akey regulator in the control of cell expansion in grape fruit. Our results showthat VvCEB1 binds directly to the promoters of cell expansion-related genes ingrape fruit and acts as a transcriptional activator, while VvDELLA2 blocks VvCEB1function by binding to its activating structural domain. The exogenousgibberellin treatment relieved this inhibition by promoting the degradation ofVvDELLA2 protein, thus, allowing VvCEB1 to transcriptionally activate theexpression of cell expansion-related genes.

However, to the best of ourknowledge, no information is yet available regarding the effects of 13CRA oncholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a malignancy of the bile duct epithelia. Currently,there are no reliably effective therapeutic options for metastatic CCA. Thepresent study thus aimed to evaluate the effects of 13CRA on the self‑renewal,migration, invasion and adhesion of CCA cells, and also investigated theunderlying mechanisms.

To cope with drought, plants havedrought tolerance mechanisms at the physiological, biochemical, and molecularlevels. In this study, the effects of foliar application of distilled water andmethyl jasmonate (MeJA) (5 and 50 µM) on the physiological, biochemical, andmolecular responses of Impatiens walleriana during two drought regimes (15 and 5%soil water content, SWC) were investigated. The results showed that plantresponse depended on the concentration of the elicitor and the stress intensity.The highest chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were observed at 5% SWC in plantspre-treated with 50 µM MeJA, while the MeJA did not have a significant effect onthe chlorophyll a/b ratio in drought-stressed plants. Drought-induced formationof hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde in plants sprayed with distilled waterwas significantly reduced in plant leaves pretreated with MeJA. The lower totalpolyphenol content and antioxidant activity of secondary metabolites inMeJA-pretreated plants were observed. The foliar application of MeJA affected theproline content and antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase,peroxidase, and catalase) in plants that suffered from drought. The expression ofabscisic acid (ABA) metabolic genes (IwNCED4, IwAAO2, and IwABA8ox3) was the mostaffected in plants sprayed with 50 µM MeJA, while of the four analyzed aquaporingenes (IwPIP1;4, IwPIP2;2, IwPIP2;7, and IwTIP4;1), the expression of IwPIP1;4and IwPIP2;7 was strongly induced in drought-stressed plants pre-treated with 50µM MeJA.

Here, we investigated the functions of OsPP2CAs and their crosstalkwith ABA and gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathways in rice (Oryza sativa).Among the nine OsPP2CAs, OsPP2C08 had the highest amino acid sequence similaritywith OsPP2C51, which positively regulates GA signaling in rice seed germination.However, OsPP2C08 was expressed in different tissues (internodes, sheaths, andflowers) compared to OsPP2C51, which was specifically expressed in seeds, andshowed much stronger induction under abiotic stress than OsPP2C51. Transgenicrice lines overexpressing OsPP2C08 (OsPP2C08-OX) had a typical ABA-insensitivephenotype in a post-germination assay, indicating that OsPP2C08, as with otherOsPP2CAs, negatively regulates ABA signaling. Furthermore, OsPP2C08-OX lines hadlonger stems than wild-type (WT) plants due to longer internodes, especiallybetween the second and third nodes. Internode cells were also longer inOsPP2C08-OX lines than in the WT. As GA positively regulates plant growth, theseresults suggest that OsPP2C08 might positively regulate GA biosynthesis. Indeed,the expression levels of GA biosynthetic genes including gibberellin 20-oxidase(OsGA20ox4) and Ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (OsKAO) were increased in OsPP2C08-OXlines, and we observed that GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 4 (OsGA2ox4), encoding anoxidase that catalyzes the 2-beta-hydroxylation of several biologically activeGAs, was repressed in the OsPP2C08-OX lines based on a transcriptome deepsequencing and RT-qPCR analysis. Furthermore, we compared the accumulation ofSLENDER RICE 1 (SLR1), a DELLA protein involved in GA signaling, in OsPP2C08-OXand WT plants, and observed lower levels of SLR1 in the OsPP2C08-OX lines than inthe WT. Taken together, our results reveal that OsPP2C08 negatively regulates ABAsignaling and positively regulates GA signaling in rice. Our study providesvaluable insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk betweenGA and ABA signaling in rice.","Song, Jaeeun, Ga, Eunji, Park, Sangkyu, Lee, Hyo, Yoon, In Sun, Lee, Saet Buyl, Lee, Jong-Yeol, Kim, Beom-Gi",2023,International journal of molecular sciences,1

The mechanisms of actionare not clear, forming a barrier to investigation in Gingko-specific benefits tocancer patients, especially when combined with other therapies. Here we reportedon the discovery of a novel mechanism by which a Ginkgo golden leaf extract(GGLE) inhibited melanoma cell invasion and angiogenesis. GGLE did not inhibitmelanoma cells via direct cytotoxicity. Instead, GGLE significantly inhibitedtotal RNase activities in melanoma cells under both normoxia and hypoxiaconditions. The RNase angiogenin was induced twofolds by hypoxia, and theinduction was significantly suppressed by GGLE treatment in a dose dependentmanner. As a result of angiogenin inhibition, GGLE inhibited melanoma cellmigration and invasion in a dose dependent manner. Conditioned media frommelanoma cell culture sufficiently induced in vitro angiogenesis in humanendothelial cells, whereas the conditioned media of GGLE-treated melanoma cellssignificantly inhibited this angiogenetic activity. This was accompanied withmarkedly reduced angiogenin concentrations in the GGLE-treated melanoma cellconditioned media. We concluded that, instead of direct cytotoxicity, GGLEinhibited angiogenin synthesis and secretion by melanoma cells, resulting ininhibition of tumor cell invasion and tumor-induced angiogenesis. This newmechanism opens the door for investigation in GGLE influencing tumormicroenvironment, and warrants further investigation and validation in vivo.","Chen, Ping, Wang, Tao, Chen, Qi",2023,Integrative cancer therapies,1

Vitamin A was elevated in plasma although not in ocular tissue.Bisretinoids form in photoreceptor cell outer segments by random reactions ofretinaldehyde with phosphatidylethanolamine. We found that the latterphospholipid was significantly increased in mice fed an HFD versus mice on acontrol diet. In leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, a genetic model of obesity, plasmalevels of retinol-binding protein 4 were higher but bisretinoids in retina werenot elevated. Photoreceptor cell viability measured as outer nuclear layerthickness was reduced in the ob/ob mice relative to WT.

Preclinical evidence demonstrates that cannabinoids canmodulate several cancer hallmarks of many tumor types. However, the therapeuticpotential of cannabinoids in prostate cancer has not yet been fully explored. Theaim of this study was to investigate the antiproliferative and anti-invasiveproperties of cannabidiol (CBD) in prostate cancer cells in vitro. CBD inhibitedcell viability and proliferation, accompanied by reduced expression of key cellcycle proteins, specifically cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinases CDK2, CDK4,and CDK1, and inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. The effects of CBD on cellviability were not blocked by cannabinoid receptor antagonists, a transientreceptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel blocker, or an agonist of theG-protein-coupled receptor GPR55, suggesting that CBD acts independently of thesetargets in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, CBD reduced the invasiveness ofhighly metastatic PC-3 cells and increased protein expression of E-cadherin. Theability of CBD to inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasivenesssuggests that CBD may have potential as a future chemotherapeutic agent.","O'Reilly, Eve, Khalifa, Karima, Cosgrave, Joanne, Azam, Haleema, Prencipe, Maria, Simpson, Jeremy C, Gallagher, William M, Perry, Antoinette S",2023,Journal of natural products,1

CBD decreased median eyelid closureamplitude by 19.1% (-1.66 mm, confidence interval [CI] = -3.19 to -0.14 mm, P =0.03), decreased median eyelid closure duration by 15.8% (-18.35 ms, CI = -29.37to -7.32 ms, P = 0.001), and increased the maximum eyelid closure velocity by34.8% (-13.26 mm/ms, CI = -20.93 to -5.58 mm/ms, P = 0.001). The JRS showed a 0.5reduction in severity and frequency, which was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Low dose CBD was safely tolerated and improved several BPS kinematicparameters. The clinical scale suggested a direction of effect but may have beenunderpowered. Further studies are needed to better quantify the clinicalrelevance.

TA056198,10.1038/s41598-023-42015-2,Multi-structural molecular docking (MOD) combined with molecular dynamics revealthe structural requirements of designing broad-spectrum inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2entry to host cells.,"New variants of SARS-CoV-2 that can escape immune response continue to emerge.Consequently, there is an urgent demand to design small molecule therapeuticsinhibiting viral entry to host cells to reduce infectivity rate. Despite numerousin silico and in situ studies, the structural requirement of designingviral-entry inhibitors effective against multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 has yetto be described. Here we systematically screened the binding of various naturalproducts (NPs) to six different SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)structures. We demonstrate that Multi-structural Molecular Docking (MOD) combinedwith molecular dynamics calculations allowed us to predict a vulnerable site ofRBD and the structural requirement of ligands binding to this vulnerable site. Weexpect that our findings lay the foundation for in silico screening andidentification of lead molecules to guide drug discovery into designing newbroad-spectrum lead molecules to counter the threat of future variants ofSARS-CoV-2.","Da, Anqi, Wu-Lu, Meritxell, Dragelj, Jovan, Mroginski, Maria Andrea, Ebrahimi, Kourosh H",2023,Scientific reports,1
TA056207,10.3390/ani13122013,Effects of Supplementation with an Herbal Mixture on the Antioxidant Capacity ofMilk.,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the addition of a standardizedherbal mixture to the feed ration for Holstein-Friesian cows on the antioxidantcapacity of milk. The study was carried out on a farm specialized in breedingdairy cattle. The exact study involved 30 cows in lactation III, which were inthe first phase of lactation at the beginning of the experiment (15 cows-controlgroup; 15 cows-experimental group). The nutrition supplied to the cows was basedon the TMR (total mixed ration) system, with roughage and concentrate fodder usedas the basis of the feed ration. The addition of a standardized blend of driedherbs, i.e., oregano (Origanum vulgare), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), purpleconeflower (Echinacea purpurea), and cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), wasthe experimental factor. Powdered herbs were administered as a component of theconcentrate fodder at the dose of 3% DM ration/day/head. Milk samples werecollected four times during the experiment (term 0 after the colostrum period andthen after lactation weeks 2, 4, and 6). The following parameters were determinedin the milk: the basic chemical composition, i.e., the content of total protein,fat, lactose, and casein; somatic cell count; content of selected whey proteins(α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, lactoferrin, BSA); and fat-soluble vitamins (A,D(3), E). Additionally, the milk antioxidant capacity (ABTS, FRAP, DPPH) wasdetermined and the degree of antioxidant protection (DAP) was calculated. It wasshown that the milk from cows receiving the herbal blend-supplemented fodder hada higher content of casein, compared to the control group. The herbalsupplementation contributed to a significant increase in the content of bioactivecompounds, i.e., selected whey proteins (β-lactoglobulin, lactoferrin) andlipophilic vitamins (A, E). The milk was also characterized by significantlyhigher antioxidant potential (regardless of the measurement method) and a higherdegree of antioxidant protection (DAP).","Stobiecka, Magdalena, Król, Jolanta, Brodziak, Aneta, Klebaniuk, Renata, Kowalczuk-Vasilev, Edyta",2023,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,1

Seriphidium, one of the most species-diverse groupswithin Artemisia, grows mainly in arid or semi-arid regions in temperateclimates. Some members have considerable medicinal, ecological, and economicvalue. Previous studies on this subgenus have been limited by a dearth of geneticinformation and inadequate sampling, hampering our understanding of theirphylogenetics and evolutionary history. We therefore sequenced and compared thechloroplast genomes of this subgenus, and evaluated their phylogeneticrelationships. RESULTS: We newly sequenced 18 chloroplast genomes of 16 subg.Seriphidium species and compared them with one previously published taxon. Thechloroplast genomes, at 150,586-151,256 bp in length, comprised 133 genes,including 87 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, 8 rRNA genes, and onepseudogene, with GC content of 37.40-37.46%. Comparative analysis showed thatgenomic structures and gene order were relatively conserved, with only somevariation in IR borders. A total of 2203 repeats (1385 SSRs and 818 LDRs) and 8highly variable loci (trnK - rps16, trnE - ropB, trnT, ndhC - trnV, ndhF, rpl32 -trnL, ndhG - ndhI and ycf1) were detected in subg. Seriphidium chloroplastgenomes. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole chloroplast genomes based on maximumlikelihood and Bayesian inference analyses resolved subg. Seriphidium aspolyphyletic, and segregated into two main clades, with the monospecific sect.Minchunensa embedded within sect. Seriphidium, suggesting that the wholechloroplast genomes can be used as molecular markers to infer the interspecificrelationship of subg. Seriphidium taxa. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealinconsistencies between the molecular phylogeny and traditional taxonomy of thesubg. Seriphidium and provide new insights into the evolutionary development ofthis complex taxon. Meanwhile, the whole chloroplast genomes with sufficientlypolymorphic can be used as superbarcodes to resolve interspecific relationshipsin subg. Seriphidium.","Jin, Guangzhao, Li, Wenjun, Song, Feng, Yang, Lei, Wen, Zhibin, Feng, Ying",2023,BMC plant biology,1
TA056251,10.1038/s41598-023-49627-8,Menahydroquinone-4 may play a key role in regulating CCL5 expression induced byepidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors frequently cause severe skinrash as a side effect, which is a critical burden for patients who continuouslyreceive drug treatments. Several recent clinical trials have shown that vitamin Kis effective against these side effects; however, the underlying mechanismsremain unclear. EGFR inhibitors induce C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) indermopathy. We hypothesized that menahydroquinone-4 (MKH), the active form ofmenaquinone-4 (MK-4, vitamin K(2(20))), supplied by biosynthesis or externaldelivery, is essential for the suppressive effect on CCL5. The aim of this studywas to explore the underlying mechanisms governing the relieving effects of MKHagainst skin rashes caused by EGFR inhibitors. The responses generated by EGFRinhibitors and the effect of MKH derivatives (two ester derivatives and MK-4) onthem were evaluated using human skin cell lines (HaCaT and HSC-1). EGFRinhibitors downregulated UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1(UBIAD1, MKH synthetase) expression and MKH biosynthesis. Knockdown of UBIAD1 orγ-glutamyl carboxylase and treatment with warfarin upregulated CCL5 expression.MKH derivatives suppressed the CCL5 expression induced by EGFR inhibitors. Ourdata strongly suggest that MKH is involved in suppressing CCL5 expression andalleviating the skin damage caused by EGFR inhibitors.","Goto, Shotaro, Setoguchi, Shuichi, Watase, Daisuke, Yamakawa, Hirofumi, Yamada, Ayano, Koga, Mitsuhisa, Matsuo, Koichi, Matsunaga, Kazuhisa, Karube, Yoshiharu, Takata, Jiro",2023,Scientific reports,1

The red cultivar of A. tricolor possesses ahigh concentration of betalains, which has been used as natural food colorants.Here, we constructed the genome of A. tricolor, the first reference genome forthe subgenus Albersia, combining PacBio HiFi, Nanopore ultra-long and Hi-C data.The contig N50 size was 906 kb, and 99.58% of contig sequence was anchored to the17 chromosomes, totalling 520 Mb. We annotated 27,813 protein-coding genes withan average 1.3 kb coding sequence and 5.3 exons. We inferred that A. tricolorunderwent a whole-genome duplication (WGD) and that the WGD shared by amaranthsoccurred in the last common ancestor of subfamily Amaranthoideae. Moreover, wecomprehensively identified candidate genes in betalain biosynthesis pathway.Among them, DODAα1 and CYP76ADα1, located in one topologically associated domain(TAD) of an active (A) compartment on chromosome 16, were more highly expressedin red leaves than in green leaves, and DODAα1 might be the rate-limiting enzymegene in betalains biosynthesis.

Patients facing a cancer diagnosis are alsostrongly pressured to use these compounds, which are often added to standardtherapeutic regimens, that should instead be based solely on diagnostic andtherapeutic care pathways (DTCP) or evidence-based medicine (EBM). This studypresents two clinical cases of cancer patients who presented to thepharmaceutical consultation service (PCD-Pharmacy Clinical Desk) established atthe CRO Institute in Aviano, Italy. Both patients were using natural productsalong with prescribed chemotherapy. In the first case, a 55-year-old womandiagnosed with bilateral breast cancer with bone metastases, who was usingnatural compounds based on diosmin, escin (or aescin) and resveratrol incombination with ribociclib anticancer therapy, a severe ADR (neutropenia) wasidentified as a consequence of the drug-natural product interaction. In thesecond case, following a detailed medication review by the PCD, we avoided takinga therapeutic treatment (with natural compounds) that in itself could potentiallyrender chemotherapy ineffective in a 57-year-old woman with multiple infiltratingductal carcinoma of the left breast; the patient was planning to take a naturalproduct containing St. John's Wort tincture and lemon balm tincture, incombination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab.

The flowersare used to treat a variety of illnesses and have both antioxidant andantidiabetic effects. However, marigolds exhibit a wide range of geneticvariations. Because of this, both the bioactive compounds and biologicalactivities of the plants differ between cultivars. In the present study, ninemarigold cultivars grown in Thailand were evaluated for their bioactive compoundcontent, as well as for their antioxidant and antidiabetic activities, usingspectrophotometric methods. The results showed that the Sara Orange cultivarpossessed the highest total carotenoid content (431.63 mg/100 g). However, Nata001 (NT1) had the highest amount of total phenolic compounds (161.17 mg GAE/g),flavonoids (20.05 mg QE/g), and lutein (7.83 mg/g), respectively. NT1 exhibitedstrong activities against the DPPH radical and ABTS radical cation, and had thehighest FRAP value as well. Moreover, NT1 demonstrated the most significant (p <0.05) α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory effects (IC(50) values of 2.57 and3.12 mg/mL, respectively). The nine marigold cultivars had reasonablecorrelations between lutein content and the capacity to inhibit α-amylase andα-glucosidase activities. Hence, NT1 may be a good source of lutein; it may alsobe beneficial in both functional food production and medical applications.","Parklak, Wason, Ounjaijean, Sakaewan, Kulprachakarn, Kanokwan, Boonyapranai, Kongsak",2023,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

This workaimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity and anxiolytic effect by differentpathways of essential oils and ethanolic extracts of three species of Lippia(Lippia alba, Lippia sidoides, and Lippia gracilis). The ethanolic extracts werecharacterized by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS(n) and their phenolics were quantified. Theantibacterial activity was evaluated by determining the minimal inhibitoryconcentration and modulation of antibiotic activity, and toxic and anxiolyticeffects were evaluated in the zebrafish model. The extracts showed compositionswith a low ratio and shared compounds. L. alba and L. gracilis showed higheramounts of phenols and flavonoids, respectively. All extracts and essential oilspresented antibacterial activity, especially those obtained from L. sidoides. Onthe other hand, L. alba extract presented the most significantantibiotic-enhancing effect. The samples were not toxic after 96 h of exposure,but showed an anxiolytic effect through modulation of the GABA(A) receptor, whileL. alba extract acted via modulation of the 5-HT receptor.

Luteolin (Lut) is anaturally occurring antioxidant that can absorb a broad range of ultravioletlight, but its water solubility and skin permeability are limited andinsufficient. The aim of the current study was to develop a Lut-loadedself-emulsifying phospholipid preconcentrate (LSEPP) for enhancing thesolubility, permeability, and photoprotective activity of Lut. The designedformulations were firstly examined for their droplet size, zeta potential,dispersity, and in vitro corneum permeability after dispensing the preconcentrateto form an emulsion; the optimized formulation was further characterized for itsemulsified morphology, compatibility with excipients, stability in thepreconcentrate form, and photoprotective activity by the HaCaT cell model underthe emulsified status. The optimized LSEPP formulation attained a smaller dropletsize (140.6 ± 24.2 nm) with the addition of 1,8-cineole and increased thepermeability of Lut by 7-fold. As evidenced in the cell model studies, theoptimized LSEPP formulation can efficiently deliver Lut into HaCaT cells afteremulsification and result in a 115% better cell viability as well as a 203%stronger ROS scavenging capability, compared with those of unformulated Lut afterUVB irradiation. To sum up, we have successfully developed an LSEPP formulation,which is a safe and promising topical delivery system for enhancing thephotoprotective effects of Lut.","Hsieh, Yun-Shan, Chen, Yih-Fung, Cheng, Yung-Yi, Liu, Wan-Yi, Wu, Yu-Tse",2022,Pharmaceutics,1

However, lncRNAs and their regulatory roles remain poorlystudied in horticultural plants. Rose is economically important not only fortheir wide use as garden and cut flowers but also as important sources of naturalfragrance for perfume and cosmetics industry, but presently little was knownabout the regulatory mechanism of the floral scent production. In this paper, aRNA-Seq analysis with strand-specific libraries, was performed to rose flowers indifferent flowering stages. The scented variety 'Tianmidemeng' (Rosa hybrida) wasused as plant material. A total of 13,957 lncRNAs were identified by mining theRNA-Seq data, including 10,887 annotated lncRNAs and 3070 novel lncRNAs. Amongthem, 10,075 lncRNAs were predicted to possess a total of 29,622 target genes,including 54 synthase genes and 24 transcription factors related to floral scentsynthesis. 425 lncRNAs were differentially expressed during the floweringprocess, among which 19 were differentially expressed among all the threeflowering stages. Using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), wecorrelate the differentially-expressed lncRNAs to synthesis of individual floralscent compounds. Furthermore, regulatory function of one of candidate lncRNAs forfloral scent synthesis was verified using VIGS method in the rose. In this study,we were able to show that lncRNAs may play important roles in floral scentproduction in the rose.

They are known for numerous biological functionsand contribute to the undesirable bitter off-taste of carrots and their products.Despite their interesting biological functions, the genetic basis of theirstructural diversity and function is widely unknown. A better understanding ofthe genetics of the PA levels present in carrot roots might support breeding ofcarrot cultivars with tailored PA levels for food production or nutraceuticals.RESULTS: A large carrot F(2) progeny derived from a cross of a cultivated inbredline with an inbred line derived from a Daucus carota ssp. commutatus accessionrich in PAs was used for linkage mapping and quantitative trait locus (QTL)analysis. Ten QTLs for FaOH and FaDOH levels in roots were identified in thecarrot genome. Major QTLs for FaOH and FaDOH with high LOD values of up to 40were identified on chromosomes 4 and 9. To discover putative candidate genes fromthe plant fatty acid metabolism, we examined an extended version of the inventoryof the carrot FATTY ACID DESATURASE2 (FAD2) gene family. Additionally, we usedthe carrot genome sequence for a first inventory of ECERIFERUM1 (CER1) genespossibly involved in PA biosynthesis. We identified genomic regions on differentcarrot chromosomes around the found QTLs that contain several FAD2 and CER1 geneswithin their 2-LOD confidence intervals. With regard to the major QTLs onchromosome 9 three putative CER1 decarbonylase gene models are proposed ascandidate genes. CONCLUSION: The present study increases the current knowledge onthe genetics of PA accumulation in carrot roots. Our finding that carrotcandidate genes from the fatty acid metabolism are significantly associated withmajor QTLs for both major PAs, will facilitate future functional gene studies anda further dissection of the genetic factors controlling PA accumulation.Characterization of such candidate genes will have a positive impact on carrotbreeding programs aimed at both lowering or increasing PA concentrations incarrot roots.","Dunemann, Frank, He, Wanying, Böttcher, Christoph, Reichardt, Sven, Nothnagel, Thomas, Heuvelmans, Paul, Hermans, Freddy",2022,BMC plant biology,1
TA056687,10.3389/fmicb.2022.826635,"Herbivory Protection via Volatile Organic Compounds Is Influenced by MaizeGenotype, Not Bacillus altitudinis-Enriched Bacterial Communities.","Belowground, plants interact with beneficial soil microbes such as plantgrowth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). PGPR are rhizosphere bacteria thatcolonize roots and elicit beneficial effects in plants such as improved plantgrowth, pathogen resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, and herbivore protection.Treatment of plants with PGPR has been shown to trigger the emission of volatileorganic compounds (VOCs). Volatile emissions can also be triggered by herbivory,termed herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV), with important ramifications forchemical-mediated plant and insect interactions. Much of our currentunderstanding of PGPR and herbivore-induced volatiles is based on studies usingone plant genotype, yet domestication and modern breeding has led to thedevelopment of diverse germplasm with altered phenotypes and chemistry. In thisstudy, we investigated if volatile emissions triggered by PGPR colonization andherbivory varies by maize genotype and microbial community assemblages. Six maizegenotypes representing three decades of crop breeding and two heterotic groupswere used, with four microbiome treatments: live or sterilized soil, with orwithout a Bacillus inoculant. Soil sterilization was used to delay microbiomeestablishment, resulting in low-diversity treatments. At planting, maize seedswere inoculated with PGPR Bacillus altitudinis AP-283 and grown under greenhouseconditions. Four weeks post planting, plants were subjected to feeding by thirdinstar Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae. Volatiles were collectedusing solid phase microextraction and analyzed with gas chromatography-massspectrometry. Illumina NovaSeq 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was carried out tocharacterize the rhizosphere microbiome. Maize genotype significantly influencedtotal volatile emissions, and relative abundance of volatile classes. We did notdocument a strong influence of microbe treatment on plant VOC emissions. However,inoculating plants with PGPR improved plant growth under sterile conditions.Taken together, our results suggest that genotypic variation is the dominantdriver in HIPV composition and individual HIPV abundances, and anybacterial-mediated benefit is genotype and HIPV-specific. Therefore,understanding the interplay of these factors is necessary to fully harnessmicrobially-mediated benefits and improve agricultural sustainability.","Raglin, Sierra S, Kent, Angela D, Ngumbi, Esther N",2022,Frontiers in microbiology,1

The acylgroups included alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, hetaryl, and ferrocene moieties. Thepresence of syn/anti-isomers and their ratios were estimated, and some reasonsexplaining experimental facts were formulated. In particular, all aliphatic andheterocyclic units in the acylic R(CO) fragments led to an increased content ofthe syn-form in DMSO-d(6) solutions. In contrast, only the anti-form was detectedin DMSO-d(6) and CDCl(3) in the case when R = Ph, ferrocenyl, (R)-myrtenyl. Inthe case of a chiral compound derived from the natural terpene myrtene, a newdynamic process was found in addition to the expected inversion around the amideN-C(O) bond. Here, rotation around the CO-C=C bond in the acylic R fragment wasdetected, and its energy was estimated. For this compound, ΔG for amide N-C(O)inversion was found to be equal to 15.0 ± 0.2 kcal/mol, and for the rotationaround the N(CO)-C(2') bond, it was equal to 15.6 ± 0.3 kcal/mol. NMR analysis ofthe chiral bispidine-based bis-amide was conducted for the first time. Two X-raystructures are reported. For the first time, the unique syn-form was found in thecrystal of an acyclic bispidine-based bis-amide. Quantum chemical calculationsrevealed the unexpected mechanism for amide bond inversion. It was found that thereaction does not proceed as direct N-C(O) bond inversion in the double-chair(CC) conformation but rather requires the conformational transformation into thechair-boat (CB) form first. The amide bond inversion in the latter requires lessenergy than in the CC form.","Krut'ko, Dmitry P, Medved'ko, Alexey V, Lyssenko, Konstantin A, Churakov, Andrei V, Dalinger, Alexander I, Kalinin, Mikhail A, Gudovannyy, Alexey O, Ponomarev, Konstantin Y, Suslov, Eugeny V, Vatsadze, Sergey Z",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

We present a detailed analysis of in situobservations of O(3) and NO (x) to (1) disentangle the main processes propellingO(3) formation such as precursor emissions and meteorology and (2) quantify theimpact of NO (x) reductions and (3) estimate the effect of climate warming. Thetemperature sensitivity of surface O(3) production is assessed separately for NO(x) and VOC limited regimes. The temperature sensitivity of ozone increases withtemperature in spring and summer. On average, the evaluated absolute values ofthe sensitivities are a factor of 2.5 larger in summer than in spring. Theanalysis of ambient O(3) burdens during hot summers indicates that risingtemperatures in a warming climate might largely offset the benefit of futureemission reductions. MAX-DOAS formaldehyde (HCHO) measurements in Vienna from2017 to 2019 are used as a proxy for VOC emissions. The seasonal and thetemperature dependence of the observed HCHO mixing ratios indicate that biogenicVOCs (BVOCs) are the dominant source of hydrocarbons in the urban setting duringthe ozone season. The result agrees well with VOC emission estimates that showBVOCs to be the dominant VOC source in Austria since the early 2000s.Accordingly, anthropogenic NO (x) emission reductions remain, outside of urbancores, the most effective instrument for policymakers to lower surface ozoneconcentrations in the short term.","Mayer, Monika, Schreier, Stefan F, Spangl, Wolfgang, Staehle, Christoph, Trimmel, Heidelinde, Rieder, Harald E",2022,Environmental science: atmospheres,1

TA057122,10.1051/parasite/2022019,Assessment of quantitative and semi-quantitative biological test methods ofartesunate in vitro.,"Artesunate is the current most potent antimalarial drug widely used for thetreatment of malaria. Considering the emergence of artemisinin resistance,several situations may require a simple method for artesunate quantification. Wethus developed a quantitative and a semi-quantitative biological method for thedetermination of artesunate in liquid samples. The tests are based on themeasurement of samples' antimalarial activity on Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 usinga modified SYBR Green I drug susceptibility test. For the quantitative test, weestablished a standard curve that resulted from a dose-response curve andevaluated its performances using controls samples. Whereas the linear regressionanalysis between artesunate concentration and antimalarial activity showedpromising results (linearity range 1.5-24.6 ng/mL, r(2) = 0.9373), we found thatartesunate content of the controls was significantly overestimated (p = 0.0313).For the semi-quantitative test, we compared the antimalarial activities ofsamples collected during permeation studies of artesunate to that of a reference(artesunate IC(50)) by statistical analysis. We demonstrated that antimalarialactivities of samples from permeation tests using a powder formulation ofartesunate were greater than those of samples from tests using a solutionformulation. Bioassays can be simple techniques to assess artesunate in liquidsamples, particularly in resource-limited settings. Comparison with referencemethods is still recommended when accurate drug quantification is required.","Kouakou, Yobouet Ines, Omorou, Roukayatou, Said, Ibrahim Bin, Lavoignat, Adeline, Bonnot, Guillaume, Bienvenu, Anne-Lise, Picot, Stéphane",2022,"Parasite (Paris, France)",1

The current studyindicated that hexyl butyrate (20.9-44.7%), octyl acetate (11.2-20.3%),hexyl-2-methylbutyrate (4.81-8.64%), and octyl 2-methyl butyrate (3.41-8.91%)were the major components of the EOs. The maximum (44.7%) and the minimum (20.9%)content of hexyl butyrate were obtained from Kaleibar and Sari populations,respectively. Moreover, the octyl acetate content ranged from 2% (in Mahdasht) to20.3% in Torghabeh population. The CA and PCA analysis divided the 10 Iranian H.persicum populations into three major groups. Populations from Khanghah,Kaleibar, Shebeilo, Showt, Mahdasht, and Amin Abbad showed a distinct separationin comparison with the other populations, having high contents of hexyl butyrate(39.8%) and low contents of octyl acetate (13.5%) (Chemotype II). According tocorrelation analysis, the highest correlation coefficient was among habitatelevation and hexyl butyrate content. In addition, the mean annual precipitationwas negatively correlated with the content of hexyl butyrate. Although octylacetate content showed high correlation with soil EC and mean annual temperature,it was not statistically significant. In general, in order to have plants with ahigh content of hexyl butyrate, it is recommended to harvest these plants fromregions with high altitude and low rainfall such as Kaleibar.","Mustafavi, Seyed Hamid, Abbasi, Amin, Morshedloo, Mohammad Reza, Pateiro, Mirian, Lorenzo, Jose M",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

Here, we demonstrated that ATRA inducesthe heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 complex on the surface of THP-1 macrophages,which facilitates the internalization of exogenous bacterial flagellins toactivate the inflammasome response. Mass spectrometric protein identification andco-immunoprecipitation revealed that the Hsp90 homodimer interacts with bothHsp70 and αMβ2 integrin. ATRA-induced complex formation was dependent on theretinoic acid receptor (RAR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) pathway and intracellularcalcium level and was essential for triggering the internalization of bacterialflagellin, which was clathrin dependent. Notably, in this process, αMβ2 integrinwas found to act as a carrier to deliver flagellin to the cytosol to activate theinflammasome, leading to caspase-1 activity and secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β.Our study provides new insights into the underlying molecular mechanism by whichexogenous bacterial flagellins are delivered into host cells without a bacterialtransport system, as well as the mechanism by which vitamin A contributes toenhancing the human macrophage function to detect and respond to bacterialinfection.","Hoang, Thi Xoan, Kim, Jae Young",2022,Cells,1

Phase II and III studies have demonstrated thatChinese patients treated with edaravone dexborneol within 48 h of AIS onset havebetter functional outcomes than those treated with edaravone alone. However, theeffect of edaravone dexborneol on subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has not yet beenelucidated. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of edaravonedexborneol on SAH-induced brain injury and long-term behavioral deficits and toexplore the possible mechanisms. The experimental rat SAH model was induced by anintraluminal puncture of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Edaravonedexborneol or edaravone at a clinical dose was infused into the tail vein for3 days post-SAH surgery. Behavioral outcomes were assessed by a modified Garciascoring system and rotarod, foot-fault, and corner tests. Immunofluorescence,Western blot, and ELISA methods were used to evaluate neuronal damage andoxidative stress. Our results showed that a post-SAH therapeutic regimen withedaravone dexborneol helped improve neurological function up to 21 days after SAHsurgery and demonstrated a greater beneficial effect than edaravone alone,accompanied by an obvious inhibition of neuronal apoptosis in the CA1 hippocampusand basal cortex regions. Mechanistically, edaravone dexborneol not onlysuppressed the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) but also improvedthe total antioxidant capability (TAC) 3 days after SAH. Notably, edaravonedexborneol treatment significantly inhibited the expression of another lipidperoxidation product, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), in the CA1 hippocampus and basalcortex, which are vital participants in the process of neuronal oxidative damageand death after SAH because of their acute cytotoxicity. Together, our resultsdemonstrate that edaravone dexborneol confers neuroprotection and stabilizeslong-term behavioral ability after SAH injury, possibly by suppressing4-HNE-associated oxidative stress. These results may help develop new clinicalstrategies for SAH treatment.","Chen, Qian, Cai, Yichen, Zhu, Xiaoyu, Wang, Jing, Gao, Feng, Yang, Mingfeng, Mao, Leilei, Zhang, Zongyong, Sun, Baoliang",2022,Frontiers in pharmacology,1

However, very little data are available describing potentialinteractions between honey and other topically applied agents such as antisepticsor essential oils. METHODS: Interactions between pairs of antibacterial agentswere investigated by performing checkerboard assays and determining thefractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs). Interactions between the twomonofloral honeys marri (from Corymbia calophylla) and manuka, and the antisepticagents benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine digluconate, silver (I) nitrate, teatree oil, and Eucalyptus polybractea oil were investigated against Staphylococcusaureus ATCC® 43300 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC® 27853. RESULTS: Additive orindifferent interactions (FICI 0.5-2) were observed for all combinations againstboth organisms tested, with the exception of chlorhexidine and honey.Chlorhexidine and marri honey showed an antagonistic relationship against S.aureus (median FICI 2.00, range 1.25-4.83). Similarly, chlorhexidine and manukahoney showed antagonism against S. aureus (median FICI 2.33, range 2.00-2.67).CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of chlorhexidine, these data indicate that honeydoes not interfere with the antimicrobial activity of the tested agents, and thathoney may be suitable for combination therapy with other topically appliedantibacterial agents for treating superficial bacterial infections.","Gray, Brayden H, Green, Kathryn J, Haines, Robbie R, Hammer, Katherine A",2022,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,1

In this study, we investigated the antibacterial activityof EOs extracted from three Piperaceae species collected in the Brazilian Amazonregion against a representative panel of cariogenic bacteria. The minimuminhibitory concentration (MIC) of the essential oils extracted from Peperomiapellucida (PP-EO), Piper marginatum (PM-EO), and Piper callosum (PC-EO) wasdetermined against Streptococcus mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, S. salivarius,S. sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus casei by using themicroplate microdilution method. PM-EO, PC-EO, and PP-EO displayed antibacterialactivity against all the tested cariogenic bacteria. PM-EO displayed the bestinhibitory activity, with MIC values ranging from 50 to 500 µg/mL. The lowest MICvalues were obtained for PM-EO against S. mitis (MIC = 75 μg/mL), Lactobacilluscasei (MIC = 50 μg/mL), and S. mutans (MIC = 50 μg/mL). Gas chromatography massspectrometry (GC-MS) analysis allowed the chemical composition of all the EOs tobe identified. The main constituents of PM-EO, PC-EO, and PP-EO were3,4-(methylenedioxy)propiophenone, α-pinene, and dillapiole, respectively.Finally, the compounds that were exclusively detected in PM-EO are highlighted.Our results suggest that PM-EO may be used in products for treating dental cariesand periodontal diseases.","Carvalho, Êni S, Ayres, Vanessa F S, Oliveira, Midiã R, Corrêa, Geone M, Takeara, Renata, Guimarães, Anderson C, Santiago, Mariana B, Oliveira, Thaís A S, Martins, Carlos H G, Crotti, Antônio E M, Silva, Eliane O",2022,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",1
TA057386,10.3390/ijms23084291,Potential Pro-Inflammatory Effect of Vitamin E Analogs through Mitigation ofTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Binding to the Cannabinoid 2 Receptor.,"Vitamin E acetate, which is used as a diluent of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), hasbeen reported as the primary causative agent of e-cigarette, or vaping, productuse-associated lung injury (EVALI). Here, we employ in vitro assays, docking, andmolecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations to investigate the interaction ofvitamin E with the membrane-bound cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R), and its role inmodulating the binding affinity of THC to CB2R. From the MD simulations, wedetermined that vitamin E interacts with both CB2R and membrane phospholipids.Notably, the synchronized effect of these interactions likely facilitates vitaminE acting as a lipid modulator for the cannabinoid system. Furthermore, MDsimulation and trajectory analysis show that when THC binds to CB2R in thepresence of vitamin E, the binding cavity widens, facilitating the entry of watermolecules into it, leading to a reduced interaction of THC with CB2R.Additionally, the interaction between THC and vitamin E in solution is stabilizedby several H bonds, which can directly limit the interaction of free THCs withCB2R. Overall, both the MD simulations and the in vitro dissociation assayresults indicate that THC binding to CB2R is reduced in the presence of vitaminE. Our study discusses the role of vitamin E in limiting the effect of THCs andits implications on the reported pathology of EVALI.","Manandhar, Anjela, Haron, Mona H, Ross, Samir A, Klein, Michael L, Elokely, Khaled M",2022,International journal of molecular sciences,1
TA057436,10.3389/fpls.2021.794999,Plant-Derived Cell-Free Biofactories for the Production of Secondary Metabolites.,"Cell-free expression systems enable the production of proteins and metaboliteswithin a few hours or days. Removing the cellular context while maintaining theprotein biosynthesis apparatus provides an open system that allows metabolicpathways to be installed and optimized by expressing different numbers andcombinations of enzymes. This facilitates the synthesis of secondary metabolitesthat are difficult to produce in cell-based systems because they are toxic to thehost cell or immediately converted into downstream products. Recently, wedeveloped a cell-free lysate derived from tobacco BY-2 cell suspension culturesfor the production of recombinant proteins. This system is remarkably productive,achieving yields of up to 3 mg/mL in a one-pot in vitro transcription-translationreaction and contains highly active energy and cofactor regeneration pathways.Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the BY-2 cell-free lysate alsoallows the efficient production of several classes of secondary metabolites. Ascase studies, we synthesized lycopene, indigoidine, betanin, and betaxanthins,which are useful in the food, cosmetic, textile, and pharmaceutical industries.Production was achieved by the co-expression of up to three metabolic enzymes.For all four products, we achieved medium to high yields. However, the yield ofbetanin (555 μg/mL) was outstanding, exceeding the level reported in yeast cellsby a factor of more than 30. Our results show that the BY-2 cell-free lysate issuitable not only for the verification and optimization of metabolic pathways,but also for the efficient production of small to medium quantities of secondarymetabolites.","Buntru, Matthias, Hahnengress, Nils, Croon, Alexander, Schillberg, Stefan",2021,Frontiers in plant science,1

Long-term inhalation of particulate matter with adiameter < 2.5 μm (PM2.5) induced irreversible respiratory and lung injury.However, it is not clear whether temporary exposure to massive PM2.5 would resultin epithelial damage and lung injury. More importantly, it is urgent to clarifythe mechanisms of PM2.5 cytotoxicity and develop a defensive and therapeuticapproach. In this study, we demonstrated that temporary exposure with PM2.5induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis via promoting cytokines expression andinflammatory factors secretion. The cytotoxicity of PM2.5 could be alleviated bytussilagone (TSL), which is a natural compound isolated from the flower buds ofTussilago farfara. The mechanism study indicated that PM2.5 promoted the proteinlevel of Hif-1α by reducing its degradation mediated by PHD2 binding, whichfurtherly activated NF-κB signaling and inflammatory response. Meanwhile, TSLadministration facilitated the interaction of the Hif-1α/PHD2 complex andrestored the Hif-1α protein level increased by PM2.5. When PHD2 was inhibited inepithelial cells, the protective function of TSL on PM2.5 cytotoxicity wasattenuated and the expression of cytokines was retrieved. Expectedly, the in vivostudy also suggested that temporary PM2.5 exposure led to acute lung injury. TSLtreatment could effectively relieve the damage and decrease the expression ofinflammatory cytokines by repressing Hif-1α level and NF-κB activation. Ourfindings provide a new therapeutic strategy for air pollution-related respiratorydiseases, and TSL would be a potential preventive medicine for PM2.5cytotoxicity.","Lin, Hongwei, Chen, Min, Gao, Yanjun, Wang, Zaiqiang, Jin, Faguang",2022,Environmental toxicology,1

Moreover, changes in drug efficacy over time wereevaluated by re-exposing rats to the same dose regimens during adulthood.Antidepressant-like responses were scored through a battery of distinctive tests(forced-swim, novelty-suppressed feeding, and sucrose preference) across time.The main results proved an antidepressant-like potential for ketamine andcannabidiol in adolescent rats, although their efficacy was dependent on sex andprior stress exposure, as well as on treatment length and the behavioral featureanalyzed. In general, while all tested antidepressants in male rats improvedcertain affective-like features, female rats were mainly unresponsive to thetreatments performed (except for certain benefits induced by ketamine),demonstrating the need for further characterizing proper treatments for thisparticular sex. Moreover, when rats were re-exposed in adulthood to the same drugregimens as in adolescence, a drop in efficacy was observed. These findings mayhave translational ramifications in that ketamine or cannabidiol could be movedforward as antidepressants for the adolescent depressed population, but notbefore further characterizing their potential long-term safety and/or beneficialvs. harmful effects for both sexes.","Ledesma-Corvi, Sandra, Hernández-Hernández, Elena, García-Fuster, M Julia",2022,Translational psychiatry,1

Some SWEETs were shown to also mediate transport of the plant growthregulator gibberellin (GA). The close physiological relationship between sucroseand GA raised the questions of whether there is a functional connection andwhether one or both of the substrates are physiologically relevant. To dissectthese two activities, molecular dynamics were used to map the binding sites ofsucrose and GA in the pore of SWEET13 and predicted binding interactions thatmight be selective for sucrose or GA. Transport assays confirmed thesepredictions. In transport assays, the N76Q mutant had 7x higher relative GA(3)activity, and the S142N mutant only transported sucrose. The impaired pollenviability and germination in sweet13;14 double mutants were complemented by thesucrose-selective SWEET13(S142N), but not by the SWEET13(N76Q) mutant, indicatingthat sucrose is the physiologically relevant substrate and that GA transportcapacity is dispensable in the context of male fertility. Therefore, GAsupplementation to counter male sterility may act indirectly via stimulatingsucrose supply in male sterile mutants.

Of the 4,488 proteins identified, a total of 1,305 differentiallyexpressed proteins (DEPs) were detected. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes andGenomes (KEGG) analysis of these DEPs indicated that metabolic pathways and thebiosynthesis of secondary metabolites were the two top pathways. Additionally,phytohormone quantification shows that the abscisic acid (ABA) levelsignificantly decreased, whereas the GA(3) level dramatically increased amongnine endogenous gibberellins (GAs), resulting in a significant increase of theGA(3)/ABA ratio in germinating seeds. The biosynthesis pathways of carotenoid asa precursor for ABA production and GA were further analyzed, and showed thatproteinic expressions of the candidate genes in the two pathways did notcorrelate with the transcriptional abundances. However, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoiddioxygenase (NCED), a rate limited enzyme for ABA biosynthesis, was significantlydecreased in mRNA levels in germinating seeds. By contrast, gibberellin20-oxidase (GA20ox), a key enzyme GA biosynthesis, exhibited the major increasein one copy and a slight decrease in three others at the protentional level ingerminating seeds. Gibberellin 2-oxidase (GA2ox), an inactivate enzyme inbioactive GAs, has the tendency to down-regulate in mRNA or at the proteiniclevel in germinating seeds. Altogether, these results suggested that the analysesof ABA and GA levels, the GA(3)/ABA ratio, and the expressional patterns of theirregulatory genes may provide a novel mechanistic understanding of howphytohormones regulate seed germination in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis.","Ling, Li-Zhen, Zhang, Shu-Dong",2022,PeerJ,1
TA057822,10.1155/2022/1304839,Safety and Efficacy of Medicinal Plants Used to Manufacture Herbal Products withRegulatory Approval in Uganda: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"INTRODUCTION: The Uganda National Drug Authority requires phytochemicalscreening, freedom from microbial contamination, and evidence of safety andefficacy of the constituent plants to register herbal products. Since Uganda hasno pharmacopeia, safety, efficacy, and plant processing information are notreadily available. We documented the plant materials used to manufacture productsin Uganda and established evidence of their safety and efficacy and availabilityof monographs. METHODS: The NDA register of herbal products was reviewed, and aproduct list was extracted. The herbal products were purchased from localpharmacies, and their labels were studied to identify plant ingredients and druguse. Literature was reviewed to document evidence of the safety and efficacy ofthe plant materials concerning manufacturer's claims. Also, the WHO and availableAfrican Pharmacopeia were searched to establish the availability of the plantmonographs. RESULTS: Of the 84 NDA-registered local products, only 18 wereobtained from the market; 82% were indicated for respiratory tract disorders.Thirty-three plant materials were listed with Eucalyptus globulus Labill, beingthe commonest. Several in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate efficacy, thussupporting the use of the selected plant species for empirical treatment asstated on the product label. While most plants were safe, some species such asAlbizia coriaria Oliv. had dose-dependent toxicities that cannot be predicted incombinations. The WHO, African Pharmacopoeia, and West African HerbalPharmacopoeia had only 16 plant monographs of the 33 plants of interest.Nevertheless, Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f., Azadirachta indica A.Juss., Zingiberofficinale Roscoe, and Allium sativum L. monographs were published by all threepharmacopoeias. CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical evidence of safety and efficacy existsin the literature for most of the plants used to manufacture registered herbalproducts in Uganda. More specific bioassays and clinical trials are required forthe products to provide conclusive evidence of safety and toxicity. Monographsare urgently needed for the Ugandan plants.","Kaggwa, Bruhan, Kyeyune, Henry, Munanura, Edson Ireeta, Anywar, Godwin, Lutoti, Stephen, Aber, Jacqueline, Bagoloire, Lynn K, Weisheit, Anke, Tolo, Casim Umba, Kamba, Pakoyo Fadhiru, Ogwang, Patrick Engeu",2022,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,1
TA057831,10.3390/molecules27103327,Cannabidiol Improves Antioxidant Capacity and Reduces Inflammation in the Lungsof Rats with Monocrotaline-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension.,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a plant-derived compound with antioxidant andanti-inflammatory properties. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is still an incurabledisease. CBD has been suggested to ameliorate monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PH,including reduction in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), a vasorelaxanteffect on pulmonary arteries and a decrease in the white blood cell count. Theaim of our study was to investigate the effect of chronic administration of CBD(10 mg/kg daily for 21 days) on the parameters of oxidative stress andinflammation in the lungs of rats with MCT-induced PH. In MCT-induced PH, wefound a decrease in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and glutathione level (GSH),an increase in inflammatory parameters, e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), monocytechemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), andthe overexpression of cannabinoid receptors type 1 and 2 (CB(1)-Rs, CB(2)-Rs).Administration of CBD increased TAC and GSH concentrations, glutathione reductase(GSR) activity, and decreased CB(1)-Rs expression and levels of inflammatorymediators such as TNF-α, IL -1β, NF-κB, MCP-1 and CD68. In conclusion, CBD hasantioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in MCT-induced PH. CBD may act as anadjuvant therapy for PH, but further detailed preclinical and clinical studiesare recommended to confirm our promising results.","Krzyżewska, Anna, Baranowska-Kuczko, Marta, Jastrząb, Anna, Kasacka, Irena, Kozłowska, Hanna",2022,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1
TA057892,10.3390/toxics10120771,A First-Tier Framework for Assessing Toxicological Risk from Vaporized CannabisConcentrates.,"Vaporization is an increasingly prevalent means to consume cannabis, but there islittle guidance for manufacturers or regulators to evaluate additive safety. Thispaper presents a first-tier framework for regulators and cannabis manufacturerswithout significant toxicological expertise to conduct risk assessments andprioritize additives in cannabis concentrates for acceptance, elimination, orfurther evaluation. Cannabinoids and contaminants (e.g., solvents, pesticides,etc.) are excluded from this framework because of the complexity involved intheir assessment; theirs would not be a first-tier toxicological assessment.Further, several U.S. state regulators have provided guidance for majorcannabinoids and contaminants. Toxicological risk assessment of cannabisconcentrate additives, like other types of risk assessment, includes hazardassessment, dose-response, exposure assessment, and risk characterization steps.Scarce consumption data has made exposure assessment of cannabis concentratesdifficult and variable. Previously unpublished consumption data collected fromover 54,000 smart vaporization devices show that 50th and 95th percentile usersconsume 5 and 57 mg per day on average, respectively. Based on these andpublished data, we propose assuming 100 mg per day cannabis concentrateconsumption for first-tier risk assessment purposes. Herein, we provideregulators, cannabis manufacturers, and consumers a preliminary methodology toevaluate the health risks of cannabis concentrate additives.","Vreeke, Shawna, Faulkner, David M, Strongin, Robert M, Rufer, Echoleah",2022,Toxics,1

Ellis(Rubiaceae), geniposide possesses various pharmacological activities, includinganti-platelet aggregation and anti-inflammatory action. OBJECTIVES: This studyexplores the effect of geniposide in diabetic wound model by anti-inflammatoryaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetic rodent model in Wistar rats was inducedby streptozotocin combined with high-fat feed. The selected rats were dividedinto control group, the diabetic model group and geniposide subgroups (200, 400and 500 mg/kg), and orally administrated once daily with saline or geniposide.Wound area and histochemical indicators were measured on day 7 after continuousadministration, to assess lesion retraction, inflammatory cells and fibroblasts.RESULTS: Geniposide notably enhanced lesion retraction by 1.06-1.84 times on day7 after surgical onset in diabetic rats (p < 0.05). In the pathologicalexperiment by HE staining, geniposide significantly reduced inflammatory cellinfiltration and proliferation of fibroblasts in the central lesion regions. Indiabetic rats treated with geniposide, the levels of pro-inflammatory factors(tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) and IL-6 weresignificantly reduced (p < 0.05), followed with the increment of IL-10 in adose-dependent manner. The IC(50) of geniposide on TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 could becalculated as 1.36, 1.02 and 1.23 g/kg, respectively. It assumed thatgeniposide-induced IL-10 expression contributed to inhibiting the expression ofpro-inflammatory factors. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Geniposide promoteddiabetic wound healing by anti-inflammation and adjusting blood glucose. Furthertopical studies are required to evaluate effects on antibacterial activity andskin regeneration.","Chen, Xiao-Yan, Jiang, Wen-Wen, Liu, Yan-Ling, Ma, Zhao-Xia, Dai, Jian-Qiang",2022,Pharmaceutical biology,1
TA058000,10.1080/15592324.2022.2129295,Is ABA the exogenous vector of interplant drought cuing?,"We have recently demonstrated that root cuing from drought-stressed plantsincreased the survival time of neighboring plants under drought, which came atperformance costs under benign conditions. The involvement of abscisic acid (ABA)was implicated from additional experiments in which interplant drought cuing wasgreatly diminished in ABA-deficient plants. Here, we tested the hypothesis thatABA is the exogenous vector of interplant drought cuing. Pisum sativum plantswere grown in rows of three split-root plants. One of the roots of the firstplant was subjected to either drought of benign conditions in one rooting vial,while its other root shared its rooting vial with one of the roots of anunstressed neighbor, which in turn shared its other rooting vial with anadditional unstressed neighbor. One hour after subjecting one of the roots of thefirst plant to drought, ABA concentrations were 106% and 145% higher around itsother root and the roots of its unstressed neighbor, compared to their respectiveunstressed controls; however, the absolute concentrations of ABA found in therooting media were substantially low. The results may indicate that despite itsinvolvement in interplant drought and the commonly observed exchange of ABAbetween drought-stressed plants and their rhizospheres, ABA is not directlyinvolved in exogenous interplant drought cuing. However, previous studies haveshown that even minute concentrations of ABA in the rhizosphere can prevent ABAleakage from roots and thus to significantly increase endogenous ABA levels. Inaddition, under drought conditions, plants tend to accumulate ABA, which couldmarkedly increase internal ABA concentrations over time and ABA concentrations inclose proximity to the root surface might be significantly greater than estimatedfrom entire rooting volumes. Finally, phaseic acid, an ABA degradation product,is known to activate various ABA receptors, which could enhance plant droughttolerance. It is thus feasible that while the role of ABA is limited, its morestable degradation products could play a significant role in interplant droughtcuing. Our preliminary findings call for an extensive investigation into theidentity and modes of operation of the exogenous vectors of interplant droughtcuing.","Falik, Omer, Novoplansky, Ariel",2022,Plant signaling & behavior,1

Here, we generated an SGR1-knockout (KO) null line via clusteredregularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein9-mediated gene editing and conducted RNA sequencing and gaschromatography−tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify the differentiallyexpressed genes (DEGs). Solanum lycopersicum SGR1 (SlSGR1) knockout null lineclearly showed a turbid brown color with significantly higher chlorophyll andcarotenoid levels than those in the wild-type (WT) fruit. Differential geneexpression analysis revealed 728 DEGs between WT and sgr#1-6 line, including 263and 465 downregulated and upregulated genes, respectively, with fold-change >2and adjusted p-value < 0.05. Most of the DEGs have functions related tophotosynthesis, chloroplasts, and carotenoid biosynthesis. The strong changes inpigment and carotenoid content resulted in the accumulation of key primarymetabolites, such as sucrose and its derivatives (fructose, galactinol, andraffinose), glycolytic intermediates (glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, andfructose-6-phosphate), and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (malate andfumarate) in the leaves and fruit of the SGR-KO null lines. Overall, the SGR1-KOnull lines developed here provide new evidence for the mechanisms underlying theroles of SGR1 as well as the molecular pathways involved in photosynthesis,chloroplasts, and carotenoid biosynthesis.","Kim, Jin Young, Kim, Jong Hee, Jang, Young Hee, Yu, Jihyeon, Bae, Sangsu, Kim, Me-Sun, Cho, Yong-Gu, Jung, Yu Jin, Kang, Kwon Kyoo",2022,International journal of molecular sciences,1
TA058030,10.3390/ijms232315240,Differential Water Deficit in Leaves Is a Principal Factor Modifying BarleyResponse to Drought Stress.,"In response to environmental stress, plants activate complex signalling,including being dependent on reactive oxygen-nitrogen-sulphur species. One of thekey abiotic stresses is drought. As a result of drought, changes in the level ofhydration of the plant occur, which obviously entails various metabolicalternations. The primary aim of this study was to determine the relationshipbetween the response of barley to drought and the intensity of stress, thereforeinvestigations were performed under various levels of water saturation deficit(WSD) in leaves at 15%, 30%, and 50%. In barley subjected to drought, mostsignificant changes occurred under a slight dehydration level at 15%. It wasobserved that the gene expression of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases, enzymesinvolved in ABA biosynthesis, increased significantly, and led to a higherconcentration of ABA. This was most likely the result of an increase in the geneexpression and enzyme activity of L-cysteine desulfhydrase, which is responsiblefor H(2)S synthesis. Our results suggest that the differential water deficit inleaves underlies the activation of an appropriate defence, with ABA metabolism atthe centre of these processes. Furthermore, at 15% WSD, a dominant contributionof H(2)O(2)-dependent signalling was noted, but at 30% and 50% WSD, significantNO-dependent signalling occurred.","Nykiel, Małgorzata, Gietler, Marta, Fidler, Justyna, Graska, Jakub, Rybarczyk-Płońska, Anna, Prabucka, Beata, Muszyńska, Ewa, Bocianowski, Jan, Labudda, Mateusz",2022,International journal of molecular sciences,1
TA058054,10.1038/s41598-021-00767-9,Listeria monocytogenes sensitivity to antimicrobial treatments depends on cellorigin.,"In this study we investigated how cell origin could affect the efficacy of anantimicrobial treatment (mild heating combined with terpenoids) in Listeriamonocytogenes Scott A, considering cells from: 1. single colony, 2. glycerolstock, 3. cold adapted culture, and 4. fresh culture in stationary phase. Aftertreatment, culturability on BHI medium and viability assessed by flow cytometrywere evaluated. Our results showed that the cell origin significantly impactedviability and culturability of L. monocytogenes towards antimicrobial treatment.The mild heat treatment combined or not with terpenoids mainly affectedculturability rather than viability, although the culturability of cells fromsingle colony was less impacted. Therefore, to mimic the worst scenario, theselatter were selected to contaminate Gorgonzola rind and roast beef slices and weevaluated the ability of L. monocytogenes cells to recover their culturability(on ALOA agar medium) and to growth on the food matrix stored at 4 °C for 7 days.Our results suggest that only Gorgonzola rind allowed a partial recovery of theculturability of cells previously heated in presence or not of terpens. Inconclusion, we found a connection between the cell history and sensitivity towardan antimicrobial treatment, underlying the importance to standardize theexperimental procedures (starting from the cells to be used in the assay) in theassessment of cell sensitivity to a specific treatment. Finally, our studyclearly indicated that VBNC cells can resuscitate under favorable conditions on afood matrix, becoming a threat for consumer's health.","Montanari, Chiara, Tabanelli, Giulia, Barbieri, Federica, Mora, Diego, Duncan, Robin, Gardini, Fausto, Arioli, Stefania",2021,Scientific reports,1

Theincorporation of flow-modulated comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographyin this type of analysis provides a possibility to improve the quality of resultsdue to the enhancement of separation capacity and resolution. In this study,flow-modulated comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography was incorporatedin enantioselective analysis to determine the influence of winemaking technologyon specific features of botrytized wines. The samples included Tokaj essences(high-sugar wines), Tokaj botrytized wines and varietal wines (Furmint, MuscatLunel, Lipovina) and wines maturated on grape peels. The obtained data wasprocessed with hierarchic cluster analysis to reveal variations in compositionand assess classification ability for botrytized wines. A significant differencebetween the samples was observed for the enantiomeric distribution of ethyllactate and presence of monoterpene alcohols. The varietal wines weresuccessfully separated from the other types, which showed more similar resultsand could be divided with additional parameters. We observed a correlationbetween the botrytized wines and the varietal wines fermented with grape skins.As to the essences produced from juice of botrytized grapes, the results werequite similar to those of the botrytized wines, even though monoterpenes were notdetected in the extracts.","Vyviurska, Olga, Koljančić, Nemanja, Thai, Ha Anh, Gorovenko, Roman, Špánik, Ivan",2021,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",1
TA058162,10.3390/molecules26175198,Effects of Traditional and Modern Post-Harvest Withering Processes on theComposition of the Vitis v. Corvina Grape and the Sensory Profile of AmaroneWines.,"In the Valpolicella area (Verona, Italy) Vitis vinifera cv. Corvina is the maingrape variety used to produce Amarone wine. Before starting the winemakingprocess, the Corvina grapes are stored in a withering (i.e., dehydrating)warehouse until about 30% of the berry weight is lost (WL). This practice isperformed to concentrate the metabolites in the berry and enrich the Amarone winein aroma and antioxidant compounds. In compliance with the guidelines and strictAmarone protocol set by the Consorzio of Amarone Valpolicella, withering must becarried out by setting the grapes in a suitable environment, either undercontrolled relative air humidity (RH) conditions and wind speed (WS)-notemperature modification is to be applied-or, following the traditional methods,in non-controlled environmental conditions. In general, the two processes havedifferent dehydration kinetics due to the different conditions in terms oftemperature, RH, and WS, which affect the accumulation of sugars and organicacids and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as stilbenes andglycoside aroma precursors. For this study, the two grape-withering processeswere carried out under controlled (C) and non-controlled (NC) conditions, and thefinal compositions of the Corvina dried grapes were compared also to evaluate theeffects on the organoleptic characteristics of Amarone wine. The findingshighlighted differences between the two processes mainly in terms of thesecondary metabolites of the dried grapes, which affect the organolepticcharacteristics of Amarone wine. Indeed, by the sensory evaluation, winesproduced by adopting the NC process were found more harmonious, elegant, andbalanced. Finally, we can state how using a traditional system, grapes werecharacterised by higher levels of VOCs (volatile compounds), whilst wines had ahigher and appreciable complexity and finesse.","Tomasi, Diego, Lonardi, Andrea, Boscaro, Davide, Nardi, Tiziana, Marangon, Christine Mayr, De Rosso, Mirko, Flamini, Riccardo, Lovat, Lorenzo, Mian, Giovanni",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

Groups of female ACI rats were given either an AIN-93Mdiet or a diet supplemented with cumin powder (5% and 7.5%, w/w) or driedethanolic cumin extract (1%, w/w), and then challenged with subcutaneous E2silastic implants (1.2 cm; 9 mg). The first appearance of a palpable mammarytumor was significantly delayed by both the cumin powder and extract. At the endof the study, the tumor incidence was 96% in the control group, whereas only 55%and 45% animals had palpable tumors in the cumin powder and extract groups,respectively. Significant reductions in tumor volume (660 ± 122 vs. 138 ± 49 and75 ± 46 mm(3)) and tumor multiplicity (4.21 ± 0.43 vs. 1.16 ± 0.26 and 0.9 ± 0.29tumors/animal) were also observed by the cumin powder and cumin extract groups,respectively. The cumin powder diet intervention dose- and time-dependentlyoffset E2-related pituitary growth, and reduced the levels of circulatingprolactin and the levels of PCNA in the mammary tissues. Mechanistically, thecumin powder diet resulted in a significant reversal of E2-associated modulationin ERα, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Further, the cumin powder diet reversed the expressionlevels of miRNAs (miR-182, miR-375, miR-127 and miR-206) that were highlymodulated by E2 treatment. We analyzed the composition of the extract by GC/MSand established cymene and cuminaldehyde as major components, and furtherdetected no signs of gross or systemic toxicity. Thus, cumin bioactives cansignificantly delay and prevent E2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis in a safe andeffective manner, and warrant continued efforts to develop these clinicallytranslatable spice bioactives as chemopreventives and therapeutics against BC.","Aqil, Farrukh, Jeyabalan, Jeyaprakash, Munagala, Radha, Ahmad, Iqbal, Schultz, David J, Gupta, Ramesh C",2021,International journal of molecular sciences,1
TA058509,10.1111/bph.15661,"Cannabigerolic acid, a major biosynthetic precursor molecule in cannabis,exhibits divergent effects on seizures in mouse models of epilepsy.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cannabis has been used to treat epilepsy for millennia,with such use validated by regulatory approval of cannabidiol (CBD) for Dravetsyndrome. Unregulated artisanal cannabis-based products used to treat childrenwith intractable epilepsies often contain relatively low doses of CBD but areenriched in other phytocannabinoids. This raises the possibility that othercannabis constituents might have anticonvulsant properties. EXPERIMENTALAPPROACH: We used the Scn1a(+/-) mouse model of Dravet syndrome to investigatethe cannabis plant for phytocannabinoids with anticonvulsant effects againsthyperthermia-induced seizures. The most promising, cannabigerolic acid (CBGA),was further examined against spontaneous seizures and survival in Scn1a(+/-) miceand in electroshock seizure models. Pharmacological effects of CBGA were surveyedacross multiple drug targets. KEY RESULTS: The initial screen identified threephytocannabinoids with novel anticonvulsant properties: CBGA, cannabidivarinicacid (CBDVA) and cannabigerovarinic acid (CBGVA). CBGA was most potent andpotentiated the anticonvulsant effects of clobazam against hyperthermia-inducedand spontaneous seizures, and was anticonvulsant in the MES threshold test.However, CBGA was proconvulsant in the 6-Hz threshold test and a high doseincreased spontaneous seizure frequency in Scn1a(+/-) mice. CBGA was found tointeract with numerous epilepsy-relevant targets including GPR55, TRPV1 channelsand GABA(A) receptors. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest thatCBGA, CBDVA and CBGVA may contribute to the effects of cannabis-based products inchildhood epilepsy. Although these phytocannabinoids have anticonvulsantpotential and could be lead compounds for drug development programmes, severalliabilities would need to be overcome before CBD is superseded by another in thisclass.","Anderson, Lyndsey L, Heblinski, Marika, Absalom, Nathan L, Hawkins, Nicole A, Bowen, Michael T, Benson, Melissa J, Zhang, Fan, Bahceci, Dilara, Doohan, Peter T, Chebib, Mary, McGregor, Iain S, Kearney, Jennifer A, Arnold, Jonathon C",2021,British journal of pharmacology,1

CONCLUSION: These results suggested that exercise combined with L/Zisupplementation might be effective to reduce neurodegeneration via improvingneurotrophic factors and synaptic proteins, and oxidative capacity in thecerebral cortex.","Orhan, Cemal, Erten, Füsun, Er, Beşir, Tuzcu, Mehmet, Şahin, Nurhan, Durmaz Kurşun, Öznur Ece, Juturu, Vijaya, Şahin, Kazim",2021,Turkish journal of medical sciences,1
TA058528,10.3390/toxins13080576,Changes of DNA Damage Effect of T-2 or Deoxynivalenol Toxins during Three WeeksExposure in Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) Revealed by LORD-Q PCR.,"The present study aimed to adapt a Long-run Real-time DNA Damage Quantification(LORD-Q) qPCR-based method for the analysis of the mitochondrial genome of Commoncarp (Cyprinus carpio L.) and detect the DNA damaging effect of T-2 (4.11 mgkg(-1)) and deoxynivalenol (5.96 mg kg(-1)) mycotoxins in a 3-week feedingperiod. One-year-old Common carp were treated in groups (control, T-2 and DON).The mycotoxins were sprayed over the complete pelleted feed, and samples weretaken weekly. Following the adaptation of LORD-Q PCR method for the Common carpspecies, the number of lesions were calculated to determine the amount of DNAdamage. In the first and second weeks, the T-2 and the DON treated groupsdiffered significantly from each other; however these differences disappeared inthe third week. There was a significant difference in the DNA lesion valuesbetween weeks 1 and 3 in the deoxynivalenol-contaminated groups. While in the T-2treated groups, the DNA lesion values were significantly reduced on weeks 2 and 3compared to week 1. The results suggested that the trichothecene mycotoxins havea relevant DNA damaging effect.","Szabó, Rubina Tünde, Kovács-Weber, Mária, Balogh, Krisztián Milán, Mézes, Miklós, Kovács, Balázs",2021,Toxins,1
TA058539,10.3390/molecules26041126,Widely Targeted Metabolomics Analysis of Different Parts of Salsola collina Pall.,"Salsola collina Pall has a long history of being used as a traditional medicineto treat hypertension, headache, insomnia, constipation and vertigo. However,only a few biologically active substances have been identified from S. collina.Here, the shoots and roots of S. collina, namely L-Sc and R-Sc, were studied. Theprimary and secondary metabolites were investigated using ultrahigh-performanceliquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry(UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). A total of 637 putative metabolites were identified and thesemetabolites were mainly classified into ten different categories. Correlationanalysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, principal component analysis andorthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis of metabolites showed thatthe L-Sc samples could be clearly separated from the R-Sc samples. Differentialaccumulated metabolite analysis revealed that most of differential primarymetabolites were significantly lower in the L-Sc than in the R-Sc. Conversely,the major differential secondary metabolites had higher levels in the L-Sc thanin the R-Sc. Further analysis indicated that the flavonoids were the majorputative antioxidant components and most of putative antioxidant componentsexhibited higher relative concentrations in the L-Sc than the R-Sc. These resultsimprove our understanding of metabolite accumulation and provide a reference forthe study of medicinal value in S. collina.","Li, Shipeng, Chen, Ye, Duan, Ying, Zhao, Yinhui, Zhang, Di, Zang, Liyan, Ya, Huiyuan",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1
TA058564,10.2147/DDDT.S299678,Characterization of Oxygenated Heterocyclic Compounds and in vitro AntioxidantActivity of Pomelo Essential Oil.,"PURPOSE: Citrus essential oils are widely used for aromatherapy and thealternative treatment of chronic diseases. Beyond the aroma substances, they areknown to contain bioactive nonvolatile components; however, little knowledge hasbeen gained about nonvolatiles in the essential oil of pomelo (Citrus grandisOsbeck), the largest citrus fruit. The purpose of this study was to analyze thenonvolatile oxygenated heterocyclic compounds (OHCs) of pomelo essential oils andevaluate their in vitro antioxidant activities for further development. METHODS:Cold-pressed essential oil (CPEO) and distilled essential oil (DEO) were obtainedfrom the peel of the Liangping pomelo cultivar. High-performance liquidchromatography (HPLC) coupled with a photodiode array and fluorescence detectionmethod was developed to identify and quantify the OHCs of the two essential oils.Ferric reducing antioxidant power and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) radical scavengingassays were used to determine the antioxidative capabilities. RESULTS: ThirteenOHCs were identified in CPEO. Coumarins such as meranzin (2.0 mmol L(-1)) andfuranocoumarins such as isoimperatorin (1.3 mmol L(-1)) composed the majority ofnonvolatiles in CPEO. These OHCs were characterized by high proportion (58%) ofside chain epoxides. Five OHCs, namely, auraptenol, 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin(6',7'-DHB), imperatorin, isoimperatorin and 8-geranyloxypsoralen were firstidentified in pomelo CPEO. Eight OHCs were detected at trace amounts in pomeloDEO. Antioxidant assays showed that CPEO was multiple times more potent than DEOregarding the total reducing power and radical scavenging capacity. Clearance ofPTIO, a stable reactive oxygen species, followed slow kinetics. CONCLUSION:Coumarins and furanocoumarins, two families of OHCs, constituted most of thenonvolatile components in CPEO. The nonvolatiles contributed significantly to thein vitro antioxidant activity of CPEO. Pomelo CPEO showed good prospects as apotential long-lasting natural antioxidant.","Li, Guijie, Cheng, Yujiao, Zhang, Tenghui, Li, Yingzhuo, Han, Leng, Liang, Guolu",2021,"Drug design, development and therapy",1
TA058581,10.1167/iovs.62.2.1,Relative Contributions of All-Trans and 11-Cis Retinal to Formation of Lipofuscinand A2E Accumulating in Mouse Retinal Pigment Epithelium.,"PURPOSE: Bis-retinoids are a major component of lipofuscin that accumulates inthe retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in aging and age-related maculardegeneration (AMD). Although bis-retinoids are known to originate fromretinaldehydes required for the light response of photoreceptor cells, therelative contributions of the chromophore, 11-cis retinal, and photoisomerizationproduct, all-trans retinal, are unknown. In photoreceptor outer segments,all-trans retinal, but not 11-cis retinal, is reduced by retinol dehydrogenase 8(RDH8). Using Rdh8-/- mice, we evaluated the contribution of increased all-transretinal to the formation and stability of RPE lipofuscin. METHODS: Rdh8-/- micewere reared in cyclic-light or darkness for up to 6 months, with selectedlight-reared cohorts switched to dark-rearing for the final 1 to 8 weeks. Thebis-retinoid A2E was measured from chloroform-methanol extracts of RPE-choroidusing HPLC-UV/VIS spectroscopy. Lipofuscin fluorescence was measured from wholeflattened eyecups (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 565-725 nm). RESULTS:Cyclic-light-reared Rdh8-/- mice accumulated A2E and RPE lipofuscin approximately1.5 times and approximately 2 times faster, respectively, than dark-reared mice.Moving Rdh8-/- mice from cyclic-light to darkness resulted in A2E levels lessthan expected to have accumulated before the move. CONCLUSIONS: Our findingsestablish that elevated levels of all-trans retinal present incyclic-light-reared Rdh8-/- mice, which remain low in wild-type mice, contributeonly modestly to RPE lipofuscin formation and accumulation. Furthermore,decreases in A2E levels occurring after moving cyclic-light-reared Rdh8-/- miceto darkness are consistent with processing of A2E within the RPE and theexistence of a mechanism that could be a therapeutic target for controlling A2Ecytotoxicity.","Boyer, Nicholas P, Thompson, Debra A, Koutalos, Yiannis",2021,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,1
TA058584,10.1016/j.psj.2021.101632,"Effects of essential oil/palygorskite composite on performance, egg quality,plasma biochemistry, oxidation status, immune response and intestinal morphologyof laying hens.","The current study aimed to assess the effects of different levels of essentialoil/palygorskite composite (EO-PGS) supplementation on performance, egg quality,oxidative status, immunity and intestinal morphology of laying hens. A total of480 laying hens aged 65 wk were randomly assigned into 4 groups (6 replicates of20 hens each). Hens were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0 (control diet),0.5, 0.75 or 1.0 g/kg EO-PGS for 56 d. Data were analyzed by One-way ANOVA.Results showed that birds fed with diet supplemented with EO-PGS had increasedthe egg production (P < 0.05) more than birds fed with control diet. The yolkindex and shell thickness were increased in 0.75 and 1.0 g/kg EO-PGS groups atd56 (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in plasma biochemicalparameters among all groups. Compared with the control group, supplementation ofEO-PGS increased the immunoglobulin-G and interleukin-2 levels in plasma (P <0.05). The total antioxidant capacity in plasma and liver, the plasma catalaseconcentration, the activity of total superoxide dismutase in the liver and theactivity of glutathione peroxidase in the spleen were increased in the EO-PGSgroups (P < 0.05). The concentration of malondialdehyde in the liver wasdecreased with the increasing level of EO-PGS (P < 0.05). The crypt depth ofileum and duodenum of birds fed with EO-PGS supplemented diet had a tendency todecrease (0.05<P < 0.1) and the villus height to crypt depth ratio of ileumincreased (P < 0.05), compared with birds fed with control diet. In summary,EO-PGS supplementation improved the egg production, enhanced antioxidation andimmune functions, and ameliorated egg quality and intestinal morphology of layinghens, and a level of 0.75 g/kg EO-PGS was recommended in laying hens diets.","Cheng, H, Chen, J F, Tang, S G, Guo, S C, He, C Q, Qu, X Y",2022,Poultry science,1

Sustainable production of high-valuesubstances from one-carbon (C1) compounds, e.g., methanol supplemented as anexternal electron donor in bioreactors for wastewater treatment, is a promisingapplication of upcycling. This study undertook a gene-centric approach to screenvaluable production potentials from mixed culture biomass, removing organiccarbon and nitrogen from landfill leachate. To this end, the microbial communityof the activated sludge from a landfill leachate treatment plant and itsmetabolic potential for the production of seven valuable products wereinvestigated. The DNA extracted from the activated sludge was subjected toshotgun metagenome sequencing to analyze the microbial taxonomy and functionsassociated with producing the seven products. The functional analysis confirmedthat the activated sludge could produce six of the valuable products, ectoine,polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), zeaxanthin, astaxanthin, acetoin, and 2,3-butanediol.Quantification of the detected functional gene hit numbers for these valuableproducts as a primary trial identified a potential rate-limiting metabolicpathway, e.g., conversion of L-2,4-diaminobutyrate intoN-γ-acetyl-L2,4,-diaminobutyrate during the ectoine biosynthesis. Overall, thisstudy demonstrated that primary screening by the proposed gene-centric approachcan be used to evaluate the potential for the production of valuable productsusing mixed culture or single microbe in engineered systems. The proposedapproach can be expanded to sites where water purification is highly required,but resource recovery, or upcycling has not been implemented.","Yasuda, Shohei, Suenaga, Toshikazu, Orschler, Laura, Agrawal, Shelesh, Lackner, Susanne, Terada, Akihiko",2021,Frontiers in microbiology,1

However, Gibberellin-dioxygenases genes are rarely reported inmaize, especially response to gibberellin (GA). In present study, 27Gibberellin-dioxygenases genes were identified in the maize and they wereclassified into seven subfamilies (I-VII) based on phylogenetic analysis. Thisresult was also further confirmed by their gene structure and conserved motifcharacteristics. And gibberellin-dioxygenases genes only occurred segmentalduplication that occurs most frequently in plants. Furthermore, thegibberellin-dioxygenases genes showed different tissue expression pattern indifferent tissues and most of the gibberellin-dioxygenases genes showed tissuespecific expression. Moreover, almost all the gibberellin-dioxygenases genes weresignificantly elevated in response to GA except for ZmGA2ox2 and ZmGA20ox10 of 15gibberellin-dioxygenases genes normally expressed in leaves while 10 and 11gibberellin-dioxygenases genes showed up and down regulated under GA treatmentthan that under normal condition in leaf sheath. In addition, we found thatZmGA2ox1, ZmGA2ox4, ZmGA20ox7, ZmGA3ox1 and ZmGA3ox3 might be potential genes forregulating balance of GAs which play essential roles in plant development. Thesefindings will increase our understanding of Gibberellin-dioxygenases gene familyin response to GA and will provide a solid base for further functionalcharacterization of Gibberellin-dioxygenases genes in maize.","Ci, Jiabin, Wang, Xingyang, Wang, Qi, Zhao, Fuxing, Yang, Wei, Cui, Xueyu, Jiang, Liangyu, Ren, Xuejiao, Yang, Weiguang",2021,PloS one,1

Thehigh nutritional value and high selling price of CA make mixing it with otherlow-quality oils prevalent, in order to make huge profits. In this paper, thetransverse relaxation time (T(2)) distribution of different brands of CA and OL,and the variation in transverse relaxation parameters when adulterated with cornoil (CO), were assessed via low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR)imagery. The nutritional compositions of CA and OL and their quality indices wereobtained via high field NMR (HF-NMR) spectroscopy. The results show that thefatty acid evaluation indices values, including for squalene, oleic acid,linolenic acid and iodine, were higher in CA than in OL, indicating thenutritional value of CA. The adulterated CA with a content of CO more than 20%can be correctly identified by principal component analysis or partial leastsquares discriminant analysis, and the blended oils could be successfullyclassified by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, with anaccuracy of 100% when the adulteration ratio was above 30%. These resultsindicate the practicability of LF-NMR in the rapid screening of foodauthenticity.","Xing, Meijun, Wang, Shenghao, Lin, Jianzhong, Xia, Feng, Feng, Jianghua, Shen, Guiping",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1
TA058702,10.3390/polym13234085,The Effects of Adding Heartwood Extractives from Acacia confusa on theLightfastness Improvement of Refined Oriental Lacquer.,"In this study, a renewable polymeric material, refined oriental lacquer (ROL),used as a wood protective coating, and the Acacia confusa Merr. heartwoodextractive, which was added as a natural photostabilizer for improving thelightfastness of ROL, were investigated. The best extract conditions forpreparing heartwood extractives and the most suitable amount of addition (0, 1,3, 5, and 10 phr) were investigated. The lightfastness index including brightnessdifference (ΔL *), yellowness difference (ΔYI), and color difference (ΔE *), andtheir applied properties of coating and film were measured. In the manufacture ofheartwood extractives, the yield of extractives with acetone solvent was 9.2%,which was higher than that from toluene/ethanol solvent of 2.6%, and also had themost abundant total phenolic contents (535.2 mgGAE/g) and total flavonoidcontents (252.3 μgRE/g). According to the SEM inspection and FTIR analysis, theplant gums migration to the surface of films and cracks occurred after UVexposure. The phenomena for photodegradation of ROL films were reduced after theaddition of heartwood extractives. Among the different amounts of the heartwoodextractives, the 10 phr addition was the best choice; however, the 1 phrheartwood extractive addition already showed noticeable lightfastnessimprovement. The drying times of ROL were extended and film performances worsewith higher additions of heartwood extractives. Among the ROL films withdifferent heartwood extractive additions, the ROL film with 1 phr addition hadsuperior films properties, regarding adhesion and thermal stability, comparedwith the films of raw oriental lacquer.","Chang, Chia-Wei, Lee, Jia-Jhen, Lu, Kun-Tsung",2021,Polymers,1

American ginseng(Panax quinquefolius L.) has a long history of functional food use forimmunological disorder, colitis, cancer, and so on. This study aimed toillustrate the underlying mechanism of American ginseng's immunomodulatory effectin CTX-induced mice. In this study, all groups of American ginseng (Americanginseng polysaccharide [AGP], American ginseng ginsenoside [AGG], co-treated withAmerican ginseng polysaccharide and ginsenoside [AGP_AGG]) have relieve theimmune disorder by reversing the lymphocyte subsets ratio in spleen andperipheral blood, as well as stimulating CD4(+)T cells and IgA-secreting cells insmall intestine. These three treatment groups, especially AGP_AGG co-treatedgroup recovered the intestine morphology that up-regulated villus height(VH)/crypt depth (CD) ratio, areas of mucins expression, quantity of gobletcells, and expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin). Importantly,the microbiome-metabolomics analysis was applied in this study to illustrate thepossible immuno-modulating mechanism. The synergistic effect of polysaccharidesand ginsenosides (AGP_AGG group) restored the gut microbiota composition andincreased various beneficial mucosa-associated bacterial taxa Clostridiales,Bifidobacterium, and Lachnospiraceae, while decreased harmful bacteriaEscherichia-Shigella and Peptococcaceae. Also, AGP_AGG group altered variousfecal metabolites such as uric acid, xanthurenic acid, acylcarnitine, 9,10-DHOME,13-HDoHE, LysoPE15:0, LysoPC 16:0, LysoPI 18:0, and so on, that associated withimmunometabolism or protective effect of gut barrier.

This study was conducted to explorechanges in patients' use of dietary or herbal supplements among individualsinfected with COVID-19 before and during infection and the association betweenherbal or dietary supplements and hospitalization. A cross-sectional,questionnaire-based study was conducted enrolling symptomatic patients who hadrecently recovered from COVID-19. Data were collected through phone interviews,and McNemar's test was used to investigate changes to consumption of dietary orherbal supplements before and during infection. Multivariable logistic regressionwas used to investigate the association between supplements use during patients'infection and hospitalization. A total of 738 patients were included in thisstudy, of whom 32.1% required hospitalization. About 57% of participants weremale with a mean age of 36.5 (±11.9) years. The use of lemon/orange, honey,ginger, vitamin C, and black seed among participants significantly increasedduring their infection. In contrast, patients using anise, peppermint, and coffeepeel before their infection were more likely to stop using them during theirinfection. In addition, using lemon/orange (p < 0.0001), honey (p = 0.0002),ginger (p = 0.0053), vitamin C (p = 0.0006), black seed (p < 0.0001), peppermint(p = 0.0027), costus (p = 0.0095), and turmeric (p = 0.0012) was significantlyhigher among nonhospitalized patients than hospitalized ones. However, in themultivariable logistic regression, only use of vitamin C (OR = 0.51; 95% CI0.33-0.79), peppermint (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.31-0.90), and lemon/orange (OR =0.54; 95% CI 0.33-0.88) was associated with significantly lower odds ofhospitalization. The study reveals that patients' consumption of dietary orherbal supplements changed in response to their COVID-19 infection, withhospitalized patients having a lower likelihood of using these supplements.Because some supplements were associated with lower odds of hospitalization,these supplements or their bioactive components should be further investigated asfeasible options for COVID-19 treatment.","Aldwihi, Leen A, Khan, Shahd I, Alamri, Faisal F, AlRuthia, Yazed, Alqahtani, Faleh, Fantoukh, Omer I, Assiri, Ahmed, Almohammed, Omar A",2021,International journal of environmental research and public health,1

Meanwhile, it exhibited moderate to excellent protective and curativeefficacies in vivo. The results of morphologic observation, RNA-seq, andphysiological indicators revealed that the antifungal mechanism of isoxanthohumolis mainly related to metabolism; it affected the carbohydrate metabolic process,destroyed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and hindered the generation of ATPby inhibiting respiration. Further studies indicated that isoxanthohumol causedmembrane lipid peroxidation, thus accelerating the death of B. cinerea.

An important characteristic of the infection with this bacteriumis the formation of a biofilm and the absence of effective antibiotic therapyagainst the disease. From this scenario, the objective of this study was toevaluate the susceptibility of C. pseudotuberculosis to conventional antibioticsand to red, green, and brown propolis extracts obtained by the supercritical andethanolic extraction methods as well as its activity in the bacterial biofilm.The results of the sensitivity test using antibiotics indicated a sensitivity ofC. pseudotuberculosis strains to the antimicrobial agents. The ethanolic extractof green propolis and the supercritical red propolis extract showed the bestantibacterial activities against planktonic C. pseudotuberculosis. A lowerantimicrobial activity of the brown propolis extract was identified. Propolisextracts were effective in interfering with the formation of the C.pseudotuberculosis biofilm but had little activity on the consolidated biofilm.In conclusion, propolis extracts are more effective against C. pseudotuberculosisin the planktonic stage, being able to interfere with the formation of bacterialbiofilm. However, the action of propolis extracts in a sessile and structuredmicrobial biofilm is reduced.","Santos, Laerte Marlon, Rodrigues, Daniela Méria, Kalil, Maurício Alcantara, Azevedo, Vasco, Meyer, Roberto, Umsza-Guez, Marcelo Andres, Machado, Bruna Aparecida, Seyffert, Nubia, Portela, Ricardo Wagner",2021,Frontiers in veterinary science,1

TA058970,10.3390/molecules26061784,Triazole Fungicide Residues and Their Inhibitory Effect on Some TrichothecenesMycotoxin Excretion in Wheat Grains.,"Wheat is one of the global strategic crops and ranks third in terms of cerealsproduction. Wheat crops are exposed to many fungal infections during theircultivation stages, some of which have the ability to secrete a number of toxicsecondary metabolites that threaten the quality of the grains, consumer health,producer economics, and global trade exchange. Fifty-four random samples werecollected from wheat which originated from different countries. The samplesincluded 14 types of soft wheat to study the extent of their contamination withdeoxynivalenol (DON) and T-2 toxin by auto-ELISA technology and r-biopharmmicrotiter plate. All samples were contaminated with DON toxin except one sample,and the values ranged between 40.7 and 1018.8 µg/kg(-1). The highestcontamination rates were in Lithuanian wheat and the lowest was in Indian wheat.Meanwhile, the highest average level of T-2 toxin contamination was in Lithuanianwheat grains with 377.4 µg/kg(-1), and the lowest average was 115.3 µg/kg(-1) inPolish wheat. GC-MS/MS and multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) were used todetect 15 triazole derivatives in the collected samples, which may be used tocombat fungal diseases on wheat during the growing season. Only 9 derivativeswere found: simeconazole, penconazole, hexaconazole, cyproconazole, diniconazole,tebuconazole, metconazole, fenbuconazole, and difenoconazole. These derivativesvaried according to the origin of the wheat samples as well as theirconcentration, whereas another 6 derivatives were not detected in any samples. Adirect inverse relationship was found between the DON concentration in thesamples and the residues of simeconazole, penconazole, diniconazole,tebuconazole, metconazole, fenbuconazole, and difenoconazole, and the T-2 toxinshowed the same relationship except for tebuconazole. The safe and rational useof some triazole derivatives may be a new approach and a promising strategy tonot only reduce plant diseases and their problems, but also to get rid of somemycotoxins as grain contaminants.","Thabit, Tamer M A, Abdelkareem, Eman M, Bouqellah, Nahla A, Shokr, Shokr A",2021,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

Therefore, further research is requiredto achieve a lasting solution against this deadly disease. Repurposing availabledrugs and evaluating natural product inhibitors against target proteins ofSARS-CoV-2 could be an effective approach to accelerate drug discovery anddevelopment. With this strategy in mind, we derived Marine Natural Products(MNP)-based drug-like small molecules and evaluated them against three majortarget proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus replication cycle. A drug-like databasefrom MNP library was generated using Lipinski's rule of five and ADMETdescriptors. A total of 2,033 compounds were obtained and were subsequentlysubjected to molecular docking with 3CL(pro), PL(pro), and RdRp. The dockinganalyses revealed that a total of 14 compounds displayed better docking scoresthan the reference compounds and have significant molecular interactions with theactive site residues of SARS-CoV-2 virus targeted proteins. Furthermore, thestability of docking-derived complexes was analyzed using molecular dynamicssimulations and binding free energy calculations. The analyses revealed two hitcompounds against each targeted protein displaying stable behavior, bindingaffinity, and molecular interactions. Our investigation identified two hitcompounds against each targeted proteins displaying stable behavior, higherbinding affinity and key residual molecular interactions, with good in silicopharmacokinetic properties, therefore can be considered for further in vitrostudies.","Kumar, Vikas, Parate, Shraddha, Yoon, Sanghwa, Lee, Gihwan, Lee, Keun Woo",2021,Frontiers in microbiology,1

The dynamin-related protein(DRP1) is an important mediator of mitochondrial fission. In this study, weinvestigated the direct effects of the micronutrient retinoid all-trans retinoicacid (ATRA) on the mitochondrial structure in vivo and in vitro using Westernblot, confocal, and transmission electron microscopy, as well as mitochondrialnetwork quantification using stochastic modeling. Our results showed that ATRAincreases DRP1 protein levels, increases the localization of DRP1 to mitochondriain isolated mitochondrial preparations. Our results also suggested that ATRAremodels the mitochondrial ultrastructure where the mitochondrial area andperimeter were decreased and the circularity was increased. Microscopically,mitochondrial network remodeling is driven by an increased rate of fission overfusion events in ATRA, as suggested by our numerical modeling. In conclusion,ATRA results in a pharmacologically mediated increase in the DRP1 protein. Italso results in the modulation of cardiac mitochondria by promoting fissionevents, altering the mitochondrial network, and modifying the ultrastructure ofmitochondria in the heart.","Chidipi, Bojjibabu, Shah, Syed Islamuddin, Reiser, Michelle, Kanithi, Manasa, Garces, Amanda, Cha, Byeong J, Ullah, Ghanim, Noujaim, Sami F",2021,Cells,1

Podophyllotoxin (PPT) has been reported that can suppress MDR cancercell growth; however, effective delivery of PPT to MDR cancer cells is challengedby cascaded bio-barriers. To effectively deliver PPT to MDR cancer cells, a PPTpolymeric prodrug micelle (PCDMA) with the charge-conversion capability andself-acceleration drug release function are fabricated, which is composed of a pHand reactive oxygen species (ROS) sequentially responsive PPT-polymeric prodrugand an ROS generation agent, cucurbitacin B (CuB). After reach to tumor tissue,the surface charge of PCDMA could rapidly reverse to positive in the tumorextracellular environment to promote cellular uptake. Subsequently, the PCDMAcould be degraded to release PPT and CuB in response to an intracellular high ROScondition. The released CuB is competent for generating ROS, which in turnaccelerates the release of PPT and CuB. Eventually, the released PPT could killMDR cancer cells. The in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that PCDMA waseffectively internalized by cancer cells and produces massive ROS intracellular,rapid release drug, and effectively overcame MDR compared with the control cells,due to the tumor-specific weakly acidic and ROS-rich environment. Our resultssuggest that the pH/ROS dual-responsive PCDMA micelles with surfacecharge-reversal and self-amplifying ROS-response drug release provide anexcellent platform for potential MDR cancer treatment.","Li, Chao, Wang, Yifan, Zhang, Shuo, Zhang, Jiaojiao, Wang, Fang, Sun, Yunhao, Huang, Lirong, Bian, Wen",2021,Drug delivery,1
TA059112,10.3390/ijms222212092,Identification of DELLA Genes and Key Stage for GA Sensitivity in Bolting andFlowering of Flowering Chinese Cabbage.,"Flowering Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis var. utilis Tsenet Lee) is an important and extensively cultivated vegetable in south China, andits stalk development is mainly regulated by gibberellin (GA). DELLA proteinsnegatively regulate GA signal transduction and may play an important role indetermining bolting and flowering. Nevertheless, no systematic study of the DELLAgene family has been undertaken in flowering Chinese cabbage. In the presentstudy, we found that the two-true-leaf spraying of gibberellin A3 (GA(3)) did notpromote bolting but did promote flowering, whereas the three-true-leaf sprayingof GA(3) promoted both bolting and flowering. In addition, we identified fiveDELLA genes in flowering Chinese cabbage. All five proteins contained DELLA,VHYNP, VHIID, and SAW conserved domains. Protein-protein interaction resultsshowed that in the presence of GA(3), all five DELLA proteins interacted withBcGID1b (GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF 1b) but not with BcGID1a (GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF 1a)or BcGID1c (GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF 1c). Their expression analysis showed that theDELLA genes exhibited tissue-specific expression, and their reversible expressionprofiles responded to exogenous GA(3) depending on the treatment stage. We alsofound that the DELLA genes showed distinct expression patterns in the twovarieties of flowering Chinese cabbage. BcRGL1 may play a major role in the earlybud differentiation process of different varieties, affecting bolting andflowering. Taken together, these results provide a theoretical basis for furtherdissecting the DELLA regulatory mechanism in the bolting and flowering offlowering Chinese cabbage.","Guan, Hongling, Huang, Xinmin, Zhu, Yunna, Xie, Baoxing, Liu, Houcheng, Song, Shiwei, Hao, Yanwei, Chen, Riyuan",2021,International journal of molecular sciences,1

After a one-weekintervention, the animals' blood glucose, lipid profile, and pancreaticarchitectures were evaluated. UPLC-QTOF/ESI-MS fragmentation of CILEx and itseight docking-guided compounds were further dissected to evaluate their rolesusing bioinformatics-based network pharmacological tools. Results showed a verypromising antioxidative effect of CILEx. Both doses of CILEx were found tosignificantly (p < 0.05) reduce blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), andtotal cholesterol (TC), and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Pancreatictissue architectures were much improved compared to the diabetic control group. Acomputational approach revealed that schizonepetoside E, melianol,leucodelphinidin, and arbutin were highly suitable for further therapeuticassessment. Arbutin, in a Gene Ontology and PPI network study, evolved as themost prospective constituent for 203 target proteins of 48 KEGG pathwaysregulating immune modulation and insulin secretion to control diabetes. Thefragmentation mechanisms of the compounds are consistent with the obtainedeffects for CILEx.

TA059138,10.1186/s12934-021-01611-5,Universal capability of 3-ketosteroid Δ(1)-dehydrogenases to catalyzeΔ(1)-dehydrogenation of C17-substituted steroids.,"BACKGROUND: 3-Ketosteroid Δ(1)-dehydrogenases (KSTDs) are the enzymes involved inmicrobial cholesterol degradation and modification of steroids. They catalyzedehydrogenation between C1 and C2 atoms in ring A of the polycyclic structure of3-ketosteroids. KSTDs substrate spectrum is broad, even though most of themprefer steroids with small substituents at the C17 atom. The investigation of theKSTD's substrate specificity is hindered by the poor solubility of thehydrophobic steroids in aqueous solutions. In this paper, we used2-hydroxpropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HBC) as a solubilizing agent in a study of theKSTDs steady-state kinetics and demonstrated that substrate bioavailability has apivotal impact on enzyme specificity. RESULTS: Molecular dynamics simulations onKSTD1 from Rhodococcus erythropolis indicated no difference in ΔG(bind) betweenthe native substrate, androst-4-en-3,17-dione (AD; - 8.02 kcal/mol), and morecomplex steroids such as cholest-4-en-3-one (-﻿ 8.40 kcal/mol) or diosgenone (-﻿6.17 kcal/mol). No structural obstacle for binding of the extended substrates wasalso observed. Following this observation, our kinetic studies conducted in thepresence of HBC confirmed KSTD1 activity towards both types of steroids. We havecompared the substrate specificity of KSTD1 to the other enzyme known for itsactivity with cholest-4-en-3-one, KSTD from Sterolibacterium denitrificans(AcmB). The addition of solubilizing agent caused AcmB to exhibit a higheraffinity to cholest-4-en-3-one (Ping-Pong bi bi K(mA) = 23.7 μM) than to AD(K(mA) = 529.2 μM), a supposedly native substrate of the enzyme. Moreover, wehave isolated AcmB isoenzyme (AcmB2) and showed that conversion of AD andcholest-4-en-3-one proceeds at a similar rate. We demonstrated also that theapparent specificity constant of AcmB for cholest-4-en-3-one(k(cat)/K(mA) = 9.25∙10(6) M(-1) s(-1)) is almost 20 times higher than measuredfor KSTD1 (k(cat)/K(mA) = 4.71∙10(5) M(-1) s(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed theexistence of AcmB preference for a substrate with an undegraded isooctyl chain.However, we showed that KSTD1 which was reported to be inactive with suchsubstrates can catalyze the reaction if the solubility problem is addressed.","Wójcik, Patrycja, Glanowski, Michał, Wojtkiewicz, Agnieszka M, Rohman, Ali, Szaleniec, Maciej",2021,Microbial cell factories,1

Currently available ADtreatments only exhibit symptomatic relief but do not generally intervene withthe amyloid and tau pathologies. The extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) monophenolicsecoiridoid S-(-)-oleocanthal (OC) showed anti-inflammatory activity through COXsystem inhibition with potency comparable to the standard non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen. OC also showed positive in vitro,in vivo, and clinical therapeutic effects against cardiovascular diseases, manymalignancies, and AD. Due to its pungent, astringent, and irritant taste, OCshould be formulated in acceptable dosage form before its oral use as a potentialnutraceutical. The objective of this study is to develop new OC oralformulations, assess whether they maintained OC activity on the attenuation ofβ-amyloid pathology in a 5xFAD mouse model upon 4-month oral dosing use.Exploration of potential OC formulations underlying molecular mechanism is alsowithin this study scope. OC powder formulation (OC-PF) and OC-solid dispersionformulation with erythritol (OC-SD) were prepared and characterized using FT-IRspectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy (ScEM)analyses. Both formulations showed an improved OC dissolution profile. OC-PF andOC-SD improved memory deficits of 5xFAD mice in behavioral studies. OC-PF andOC-SD exhibited significant attenuation of the accumulation of Aβ plaques and tauphosphorylation in the brain of 5xFAD female mice. Both formulations markedlysuppressed C3AR1 (complement component 3a receptor 1) activity by targeting thedownstream marker STAT3.

The foremostunderline aim of this study was to determine the growth inhibitory effect alongwith mechanistic study of a Bruguiera gymnorrhiza extract on MCF-7. Thecytotoxicity activity was determined by using the MTS assay. Butanol extractexhibited the maximum cytotoxicity activity against the MCF-7 cells with IC(50)of 3.39 μg/mL, followed by diethyl ether and methanol extract (IC(50) at 16.22μg/mL and 37.15 μg/mL, respectively) at 72 h.

TA059273,10.1038/s41598-020-59068-2,Tritrophic interactions follow phylogenetic escalation and climatic adaptation.,"One major goal in plant evolutionary ecology is to address how and why tritrophicinteractions mediated by phytochemical plant defences vary across species, space,and time. In this study, we tested three classical hypotheses about plantdefences: (i) the resource-availability hypothesis, (ii) thealtitudinal/elevational gradient hypothesis and (iii) the defence escalationhypothesis. For this purpose, predatory soil nematodes were challenged to huntfor root herbivores based on volatile cues from damaged or intact roots of 18Alpine Festuca grass species adapted to distinct climatic niches spanning 2000meters of elevation. We found that adaptation into harsh, nutrient-limited alpineenvironments coincided with the production of specific blends of volatiles,highly attractive for nematodes. We also found that recently-diverged taxaexposed to herbivores released higher amounts of volatiles thanancestrally-diverged species. Therefore, our model provides evidence thatbelowground indirect plant defences associated with tritrophic interactions haveevolved under two classical hypotheses in plant ecology. While phylogeneticdrivers of volatile emissions point to the defence-escalation hypothesis, plantlocal adaptation of indirect defences is in line with the resource availabilityhypothesis.","Kergunteuil, Alan, Humair, Laureline, Maire, Anne-Laure, Moreno-Aguilar, María Fernanda, Godschalx, Adrienne, Catalán, Pilar, Rasmann, Sergio",2020,Scientific reports,1

Collectively, these findings suggest that strainZA_0188(T) represents a novel enteric species, for which the name Cedecea colo isproposed.","Boath, Jarryd M, Dakhal, Sudip, Van, Thi Thu Hao, Moore, Robert J, Dekiwadia, Chaitali, Macreadie, Ian G",2020,Microorganisms,1
TA059507,10.3390/molecules25020417,Allosteric Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1) Ligands Reduce Ocular Pain andInflammation.,"Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) activation has been reported to reduce transientreceptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1)-inducedinflammatory responses and is anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory in cornealinjury. We examined whether allosteric ligands, can modulate CB1 signaling toreduce pain and inflammation in corneal hyperalgesia. Corneal hyperalgesia wasgenerated by chemical cauterization of cornea in wildtype and CB2 knockout(CB2(-/-)) mice. The novel racemic CB1 allosteric ligand GAT211 and itsenantiomers GAT228 and GAT229 were examined alone or in combination with theorthosteric CB1 agonist Δ(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(8)-THC). Pain responses wereassessed following capsaicin (1 µM) stimulation of injured corneas at 6 hpost-cauterization. Corneal neutrophil infiltration was also analyzed. GAT228,but not GAT229 or GAT211, reduced pain scores in response to capsaicinstimulation. Combination treatments of 0.5% GAT229 or 1% GAT211 with subthresholdΔ(8)-THC (0.4%) significantly reduced pain scores following capsaicinstimulation. The anti-nociceptive effects of both GAT229 and GAT228 were blockedwith CB1 antagonist AM251, but remained unaffected in CB2(-/-) mice. Two percentGAT228, or the combination of 0.2% Δ(8)-THC with 0.5% GAT229 also significantlyreduced corneal inflammation. CB1 allosteric ligands could offer a novel approachfor treating corneal pain and inflammation.","Thapa, Dinesh, Cairns, Elizabeth A, Szczesniak, Anna-Maria, Kulkarni, Pushkar M, Straiker, Alex J, Thakur, Ganesh A, Kelly, Melanie E M",2020,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

Inthis regard, research is underway to find safe, effective, and economical drugsfree of these side effects. In this study, an isolated natural product fromDiospyros lotus, was tested for the aforementioned bioactivities. OBJECTIVES: Toevaluate analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and sedative potential of D. lotusextracts in animal paradigms using BALB/c mice as experimental model. METHODS:Analgesic, anti-inflammatory and sedative activities of dinaphthodiospyrol G (1)isolated from the chloroform fraction of D. lotus were evaluated using differentexperimental procedures. Anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated using thecarrageenan and histamine-induced paw edema, whereas the antinociceptive effectwas quantified by means of the hot plate analgesiometer. On the other hand, thesedative effect was determined using animal assay for screening the locomotorseffects of compound 1. Compound 1 was also subjected to molecular modelingstudies against cyclooxygenase enzymes. RESULTS: Results from this investigationshowed that the extract is devoid of anti-inflammatory and antinociceptivepotentials but has a significant sedative effect, whereas the tested compoundexhibited 55.23 and 78.34% attenuation in paw edema by carrageenan and histamineassays, respectively. A significant (p < 0.001) and dose-dependentantinociceptive and sedative effects were demonstrated by the isolated compound.Molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies of the isolated compoundagainst cyclooxygenase enzyme indicated that compound 1 forms specificinteractions with key residues in the active site of the target receptor, whichvalidates the potential use of the isolated compound as cyclooxygenase inhibitor.CONCLUSIONS: Compound 1 exhibited remarkable analgesic, anti-inflammatory, andsedative activities. These findings strongly justify the traditional use of D.lotus in the treatment of inflammation, pain, and insomnia.","Rauf, Abdur, Abu-Izneid, Tareq, Alhumaydhi, Fahad A, Muhammad, Naveed, Aljohani, Abdullah S M, Naz, Saima, Bawazeer, Saud, Wadood, Abdul, Mubarak, Mohammad S",2020,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,1
TA059578,10.3390/pharmaceutics12090873,Development of a Solid Formulation Containing a Microemulsion of a NovelArtemisia Extract with Nematocidal Activity for Oral Administration.,"BACKGROUND: Intestinal nematode infections are usually treated with benzimidazoledrugs, but the emergence of resistance to these drugs has led to an increasingdemand of new anthelmintic strategies. A new microemulsion formulation (ME)consisting of an Artemisia absinthium extract with proven nematocidal efficacywas previously developed. The aim of our study is to implement a D-optimalmixture design methodology to increase the amount of a silica material (loadedwith this ME) in a tablet formulation, considering its tensile strength anddisintegration time. METHODS: 16 experiments or combinations of the 6 tabletcomponents (loaded silica, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone,croscarmellose, Syloid(®) 244 FP and magnesium stearate) were assessed. Tensilestrength and disintegration time models were developed, and an optimizationprocess was carried out. RESULTS: Tensile strength was improved by increasing thepolyvinylpyrrolidone content, while croscarmellose decreased the disintegrationtime. The optimized powder mixture contains 49.7% w/w of the loaded silicamaterial. A compression force of 12 kN was applied to the powder mixture to formtablets with a tensile strength of 2.0 MPa and a disintegration time of 3.8 min.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that D-optimal mixture designs provide a promisingapproach to formulate liquid-loaded silica materials.","Perez-Roman, Ines, Kiekens, Filip, Cordoba-Diaz, Damian, Garcia-Rodriguez, Juan Jose, Cordoba-Diaz, Manuel",2020,Pharmaceutics,1

First-line treatments for ticsare antipsychotics and tic-specific behavioral therapies. However, due to a lackof trained therapists and adverse events of antipsychotic medication manypatients seek alternative treatment options including cannabis. Based on thefavorable results obtained from case studies on different cannabis-basedmedicines as well as two small randomized controlled trials usingdelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), we hypothesize that the cannabis extractnabiximols can be regarded as a promising new and safe treatment strategy in TS.Objective: To test in a double blind randomized clinical trial, whether treatmentwith the cannabis extract nabiximols is superior to placebo in patients withchronic tic disorders. Patients and Methods: This is a multicenter, randomized,double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, phase IIIb trial, which aims toenroll 96 adult patients with chronic tic disorders (TS or chronic motor ticdisorder) across 6 centers throughout Germany. Patients will be randomized with a2:1 ratio into a nabiximols and a placebo arm. The primary efficacy endpoint isdefined as tic reduction of at least 30% (compared to baseline) according to theTotal Tic Score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS-TTS) after 13 weeksof treatment. In addition, several secondary endpoints will be assessed includingchanges in different psychiatric comorbidities, quality of life, driving ability,and safety assessments. Discussion: This will be the first large, controlledstudy investigating efficacy and safety of a cannabis-based medicine in patientswith TS. Based on available data using different cannabis-based medicines, weexpect not only a reduction of tics, but also an improvement of psychiatriccomorbidities. If the cannabis extract nabiximols is proven to be safe andeffective, it will be a valuable alternative treatment option. The results ofthis study will be of high health-economic relevance, because a substantialnumber of patients uses cannabis (illegally) as self-medication. Conclusion: TheCANNA-TICS trial will clarify whether nabiximols is efficacious and safe in thetreatment of patients with chronic tic disorders.

TA059644,10.3390/md18050241,New Cytotoxic Natural Products from the Red Sea Sponge Stylissa carteri.,"Bioactivity-guided isolation supported by LC-HRESIMS metabolic profiling led tothe isolation of two new compounds, a ceramide, stylissamide A (1), and acerebroside, stylissoside A (2), from the methanol extract of the Red Sea spongeStylissa carteri. Structure elucidation was achieved using spectroscopictechniques, including 1D and 2D NMR and HRMS. The bioactive extract's metabolomicprofiling showed the existence of various secondary metabolites, mainlyoleanane-type saponins, phenolic diterpenes, and lupane triterpenes. The in vitrocytotoxic activity of the isolated compounds was tested against two human cancercell lines, MCF-7 and HepG2. Both compounds, 1 and 2, displayed strongcytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell line, with IC(50) values at 21.1 ± 0.17 µMand 27.5 ± 0.18 µM, respectively. They likewise showed a promising activityagainst HepG2 with IC(50) at 36.8 ± 0.16 µM for 1 and IC(50) 30.5 ± 0.23 µM for 2compared to the standard drug cisplatin. Molecular docking experiments showedthat 1 and 2 displayed high affinity to the SET protein and to inhibitor 2 ofprotein phosphatase 2A (I2PP2A), which could be a possible mechanism for theircytotoxic activity.

TA059664,10.1007/s11120-020-00737-8,Excitation quenching in chlorophyll-carotenoid antenna systems: 'coherent' or'incoherent'.,"Plants possess an essential ability to rapidly down-regulate light-harvesting inresponse to high light. This photoprotective process involves the formation ofenergy-quenching interactions between the chlorophyll and carotenoid pigmentswithin the antenna of Photosystem II (PSII). The nature of these interactions iscurrently debated, with, among others, 'incoherent' or 'coherent' quenchingmodels (or a combination of the two) suggested by a range of time-resolvedspectroscopic measurements. In 'incoherent quenching', energy is transferred froma chlorophyll to a carotenoid and is dissipated due to the intrinsically shortexcitation lifetime of the latter. 'Coherent quenching' would arise from thequantum mechanical mixing of chlorophyll and carotenoid excited state properties,leading to a reduction in chlorophyll excitation lifetime. The key parameters arethe energy gap, [Formula: see text] and the resonance coupling, J, between thetwo excited states. Coherent quenching will be the dominant process when[Formula: see text] i.e., when the two molecules are resonant, while thequenching will be largely incoherent when [Formula: see text] One would expectquenching to be energetically unfavorable for [Formula: see text] The actualdynamics of quenching lie somewhere between these limiting regimes and havenon-trivial dependencies of both J and [Formula: see text] Using the HierarchicalEquation of Motion (HEOM) formalism we present a detailed theoretical examinationof these excitation dynamics and their dependence on slow variations in J and[Formula: see text] We first consider an isolated chlorophyll-carotenoid dimerbefore embedding it within a PSII antenna sub-unit (LHCII). We show that neitherenergy transfer, nor the mixing of excited state lifetimes represent unique ornecessary pathways for quenching and in fact discussing them as distinctquenching mechanisms is misleading. However, we do show that quenching cannot beswitched 'on' and 'off' by fine tuning of [Formula: see text] around theresonance point, [Formula: see text] Due to the large reorganization energy ofthe carotenoid excited state, we find that the presence (or absence) of coherentinteractions have almost no impact of the dynamics of quenching.Counter-intuitively significant quenching is present even when the carotenoidexcited state lies above that of the chlorophyll. We also show that, above arather small threshold value of [Formula: see text]quenching becomes less andless sensitive to J (since in the window [Formula: see text] the overall lifetimeis independent of it). The requirement for quenching appear to be only that[Formula: see text] Although the coherent/incoherent character of the quenchingcan vary, the overall kinetics are likely robust with respect to fluctuations inJ and [Formula: see text] This may be the basis for previous observations of NPQwith both coherent and incoherent features.","Balevičius, Vytautas, Duffy, Christopher D P",2020,Photosynthesis research,1

Coating treatments, namely, MC, MC + TO(0.5%), MC+ TO(0.25%), GA, GA + TO(0.5%) and GA + TO(0.25%) were applied on arils bydipping, and evaluations were made on physicochemical and microbiologicalquality, phytochemicals and antioxidant capacity of arils stored (5 ± 1 °C, 95 ±2% RH) for 16 days. Dipping arils in GA or MC, both containing TO (0.5% v/v)significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced weight loss and enhanced antioxidant activity(FRAP) (p = 0.0014). However, dipping arils in GA combined with TO (0.25% v/v)had the highest influence on reducing aril respiration rate compared with othertreatments. Overall, results showed that application of coatings (GA + TO(0.5%)and GA + TO(0.25%)) reduced total yeast and mould and total plate counts andmaintained quality up to 8 days of storage.

TA059685,10.3390/molecules25204743,A Rose Extract Protects the Skin against Stress Mediators: A Potential Role ofOlfactory Receptors.,"Olfactory receptors (ORs) are expressed and active in various human tissues,including the skin. Although the sense of smell plays an important physiologicalrole in the regulation of mood and stress, a link between olfactive compounds,ORs, and skin stress has yet to be established. This study aims to investigatethe role of newly identified skin ORs and agonists in the modulation of skinstress. Screening for odorant molecules was done with cAMP functional assay toidentify OR agonists. RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence microscopy were conducted toidentify and quantify ORs in epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) and human skinexplants, as well as to evaluate specific markers (G6PDH, loricrin, and γH2AX) ofstress-induced skin alterations. A randomized double-blinded, split-face clinicalstudy was performed on a panel of stressed women to measure the benefits of ORagonist treatment for skin. Three new ORs (OR10A6, OR2AG2, and OR11H4) wereidentified in skin. A specific Rose extract and its major constituent(phenylethyl alcohol) were found to activate these ORs. The extract compositionwas revealed by both GC/FID and GC/MS analyses simultaneously and showed thepresence of 34 volatiles molecules. Moreover, epinephrine induces a skin stressresponse characterized by increased expression of G6PD, loricrin, and γH2AXbiomarkers, and a decrease of OR expression. These effects were prevented in thepresence of rose extract and its benefits were confirmed clinically by a decreasein the appearance of under-eye dark circles. Altogether, our findings suggestthat ORs may represent a new, promising way to treat stress-associated skindisorders.","Duroux, Romain, Mandeau, Anne, Guiraudie-Capraz, Gaelle, Quesnel, Yannick, Loing, Estelle",2020,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

They have differentcharacteristics and geographical distribution. Their genetic diversity anddifferentiation are unclear. Here, we identified 18,903,625 single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) and 7,314,133 insertion-deletion mutations (indels) bywhole-genome resequencing of 30 cultivated and three wild related species.Population structure and phylogenetic tree analyses divided the cultivatedaccessions into CSS and CSA containing 6,440,419 and 6,176,510 unique variations,respectively. The CSS subgroup possessed higher genetic diversity and wasenriched for rare alleles. The CSA subgroup had more non-synonymous mutations andmight have experienced a greater degree of balancing selection. The evolutionrate (dN/dS) and KEGG enrichment indicated that genes involved in the synthesisand metabolism of flavor substances were positively selected in both CSS and CSAsubpopulations. However, there are extensive genome differentiation regions (2959bins and approximately 148 M in size) between the two subgroups. Compared withCSA (141 selected regions containing 124 genes), the CSS subgroup (830 selectedregions containing 687 genes) displayed more selection regions potentiallyrelated to environmental adaptability. Fifty-three pairs of polymorphic indelmarkers were developed. Some markers were located in hormone-related genes withdistinct alleles in the two cultivated subgroups. These identified variations andselected regions provide clues for the differentiation and adaptive evolution oftea varieties. The newly developed indel markers will be valuable in furthergenetic research on tea plants.","An, Yanlin, Mi, Xiaozeng, Zhao, Shiqi, Guo, Rui, Xia, Xiaobo, Liu, Shengrui, Wei, Chaoling",2020,Frontiers in plant science,1

Gene expression of inflammatory factors, chemokines andimmune markers in adipocytes and adipose tissue, cytokines in cell culture mediumand serum, and inflammation regulatory pathways in adipocytes were detected.Results showed that UA increased the expression of interleukins and chemokines,but not TNFα, in both adipocytes and adipose tissue. IL6 and MCP1 levels in thecell culture medium and mouse serum were induced by UA treatment. Cd14 expressionlevel and number of CD14+ monocytes were higher in UA treated adipose tissue thanthose in the control group. Glucose tolerance test was impaired by UA treatmentin DIO mice. Mechanistically, UA induced the expression of Tlr4 and thephosphorylation levels of ERK and NFκB in adipocytes.

TA059767,10.1155/2020/9369815,Neuroprotection against Amyloid-β-Induced DNA Double-Strand Breaks Is Mediated byMultiple Retinoic Acid-Dependent Pathways.,"In this study, we have investigated the role of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) as aneuroprotective agent against Aβ (1-42)-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)in neuronal SH-SY5Y and astrocytic DI TNC(1) cell lines and in murine braintissues, by single-cell gel electrophoresis. We showed that RA does not onlyrepair Aβ (1-42)-induced DSBs, as already known, but also prevents theiroccurrence. This effect is independent of that of other antioxidants studied,such as vitamin C, and appears to be mediated, at least in part, by changes inexpression, not of the RARα, but of the PPARβ/δ and of antiamyloidogenicproteins, such as ADAM10, implying a decreased production of endogenous Aβ.Whereas Aβ (1-42) needs transcription and translation for DSB production, RAprotects against Aβ (1-42)-induced DSBs at the posttranslational level throughboth the RARα/β/γ and PPARβ/δ receptors as demonstrated by using specificantagonists. Furthermore, it could be shown by a proximity ligation assay thatthe PPARβ/δ-RXR interactions, not the RARα/β/γ-RXR interactions, increased in thecells when a 10 min RA treatment was followed by a 20 min Aβ (1-42) treatment.Thus, the PPARβ/δ receptor, known for its antiapoptotic function, might for theseshort-time treatments play a role in neuroprotection via PPARβ/δ-RXRheterodimerization and possibly expression of antiamyloidogenic genes. Overall,this study shows that RA can not only repair Aβ (1-42)-induced DSBs but alsoprevent them via the RARα/β/γ and PPARβ/δ receptors. It suggests that theRA-dependent pathways belong to an anti-DSB Adaptative Gene Expression (DSB-AGE)system that can be targeted by prevention strategies to preserve memory inAlzheimer's disease and aging.","Colas, Julien, Chessel, Natacha, Ouared, Allaeddine, Gruz-Gibelli, Emmanuelle, Marin, Pascale, Herrmann, François R, Savioz, Armand",2020,Neural plasticity,1

Geniposide, anextract from the Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, plays antitumor roles in humangastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and oral squamous carcinoma. However,the effects of geniposide treatment on DLBCL cells, as well as its underlyingmechanism, are still unknown. Here, we found that geniposide inhibited theproliferation of OCI-LY7 and OCI-LY3 cells in a dose-dependent manner.Furthermore, geniposide increased the percentage of apoptotic cells andupregulated the levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 in DLBCL cells.Interestingly, geniposide treatment significantly reduced the expression of thelong noncoding RNA HLA complex P5 (lncRNA HCP5) in DLBCL cells. HCP5 expressionwas revealed to be upregulated in DLBCL tissues and cell lines. Moreover, HCP5knockdown resulted in proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in OCI-LY7 andOCI-LY3 cells. miR-27b-3p was predicted as a potential target of HCP5 using thelnCAR web tool. Both HCP5 silencing and geniposide treatment increased the levelof miR-27b-3p in DLBCL cells. Accordingly, a luciferase reporter assay identifiedmiR-27b-3p as a direct target of HCP5. The expression of miR-27b-3p wasupregulated and inversely correlated with the HCP5 level in DLBCL tissues. HCP5knockdown reduced MET protein expression, which was subsequently rescued bymiR-27b-3p silencing in DLBCL cells. Importantly, the restoration of METpartially reversed the geniposide-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosisof DLBCL cells. In conclusion, geniposide inhibits the proliferation and inducesthe apoptosis of DLBCL cells at least partially by regulating theHCP5/miR-27b-3p/MET axis, indicating a potential strategy for DLBCL treatment.","Hu, Linjun, Zhao, Junjun, Liu, Yang, Liu, Xin, Lu, Qiliang, Zeng, Zhi, Zhu, Lifen, Tong, Xiangmin, Xu, Qiuran",2020,International journal of medical sciences,1

Four DES formulations were used, based on mixtures ofcholine chloride with water, propanediol, glucose, glycerol, or butanediol.β-Carotene was successfully encapsulated in a solubilized form within WPCcapsules; as a DES formulation with choline chloride and butanediol, theformulation produced capsules with the highest carotenoid loading capacity. SEMmicrographs demonstrated that round and smooth capsules with sizes around 2 µmwere obtained. ATR-FTIR results showed the presence of DES in the WPC capsules,which indirectly anticipated the presence of β-carotene in the WPC capsules.Stability against photo-oxidation studies confirmed the expected presence of thebioactive and revealed that solubilized β-carotene loaded WPC capsules presentedexcellent photo-oxidation stability compared with free β-carotene. The capsulesdeveloped here clearly show the significant potential of the combination of DESand electrospraying for the encapsulation and stabilization of highly insolublebioactive compounds.","Basar, Ahmet Ozan, Prieto, Cristina, Durand, Erwann, Villeneuve, Pierre, Sasmazel, Hilal Turkoglu, Lagaron, Jose",2020,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

Effects on cellvitality and apoptosis were assessed using Cell Titer Blue®, Caspase 3/7 Glo®,clonogenic assays as well as cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (cPARP)detection. The inhibition of the mevalonate pathway was confirmed using WesternBlot of unprenylated Ras and Rap1a proteins. Quantitative real-time PCR and ELISAwere used to analyze modulations on several key regulators of ovarian cancertumorigenesis. RESULTS: The treatment of IGROV-1 and A2780 cells with statins andzoledronic acid reduced vitality (by up to 80%; p < 0.001) and induced apoptosisby up to 8-folds (p < 0.001) in a dose-dependent fashion. Rescue experimentsusing farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate evidenced thatblocked geranylgeranylation is the major underlying mechanism of thepro-apoptotic effects. Gene expression of the tumor-promoting cytokines andmediators, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, vascular endothelialgrowth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-8, and IL-6 were significantly suppressedby statins and zoledronic acid by up to 90% (p < 0.001). For all readouts,simvastatin was most potent of all agents used. Cisplatin-resistant A2780ciscells showed a relative resistance to statins and zoledronic acid. However,similar to the effects in A2780 cells, simvastatin and zoledronic acidsignificantly induced caspase 3/7 activation (6-folds; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION:Our in vitro findings point to promising anti-tumor effects of statins andzoledronic acid in ovarian cancer and warrant additional validation inpreclinical and clinical settings.","Göbel, Andy, Zinna, Valentina M, Dell'Endice, Stefania, Jaschke, Nikolai, Kuhlmann, Jan Dominik, Wimberger, Pauline, Rachner, Tilman D",2020,BMC cancer,1
TA059973,10.3390/md18070365,Transcriptome Analysis of the Inhibitory Effect of Astaxanthin on Helicobacterpylori-Induced Gastric Carcinoma Cell Motility.,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection promotes the metastasis of gastriccarcinoma cells by modulating signal transduction pathways that regulate cellproliferation, motility, and invasion. Astaxanthin (ASTX), a xanthophyllcarotenoid, is known to inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion, however themechanism of action of ASTX in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells is notwell understood. To gain insight into this process, we carried out a comparativeRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of human gastric cancer AGS (adenocarcinomagastric) cells as a function of H. pylori infection and ASTX administration. Theresults were used to identify genes that are differently expressed in response toH. pylori and ASTX. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified differentiallyexpressed genes (DEGs) to be associated with cell cytoskeleton remodeling,motility, and/or migration. Among the 20 genes identified, those encoding c-MET,PI3KC2, PLCγ1, Cdc42, and ROCK1 were selected for verification by real-time PCRanalysis. The verified genes were mapped, using signaling networks contained inthe KEGG database, to create a signaling pathway through which ASTX mightmitigate the effects of H. pylori-infection. We propose that H. pylori-inducedupregulation of the upstream regulator c-MET, and hence, its downstream targetsCdc42 and ROCK1, is suppressed by ASTX. ASTX is also suggested to counteract H.pylori-induced activation of PI3K and PLCγ. In conclusion, ASTX can suppress H.pylori-induced gastric cancer progression by inhibiting cytoskeletonreorganization and reducing cell motility through downregulation of c-MET, EGFR,PI3KC2, PLCγ1, Cdc42, and ROCK1.","Kim, Suhn Hyung, Kim, Hyeyoung",2020,Marine drugs,1
TA059984,10.1371/journal.pone.0240939,Transcriptomic analysis of seed germination improvement of Andrographispaniculata responding to air plasma treatment.,"The plasma seed treatment is effective for promoting seed germination in manycrops. However, the biological mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, mRNAsequencing was used to screen differentially expressed genes in the germinationprocess of Andrographis paniculata seeds treated with air plasma (power density =8.99 J/cm3). Following plasma treatment, the germination percentages weresignificantly higher than those of the control, they were 3.5±0.6% vs. 0 at 28hours after sowing (HAS) and 50.3±2.6% vs. 37.3±1.7% at 48 HAS. After unigeneswere assembled and annotated, 125 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) weredetected at 28 HAS, compared with nine DEGs at 48 HAS, but no DEGs were detectedat 0 HAS, indicating that air plasma treatment mainly changed the gene expressionof A. paniculata seeds at 28 HAS. The NCED5 expression level of the treated groupwas less than one-fifth of the control, and the expressions of three ethyleneresponse factors were significantly higher than the control at 28 HAS, indicatingthat lower abscisic acid levels play an important role and ethylene signaltransduction also participates in radicle protrusion. ACO, NRT1 and PRP3expressions were significantly higher than in the control at 48 HAS, suggestingthat higher ethylene levels cause the endosperm cap to weaken and start to growroot hairs and lateral roots earlier. These findings reveal that plasma promotesseed germination mainly by regulating the expression of hormone-related genes.And the possible signal transduction of related hormones was discussed.","Tong, Jiayun, He, Rui, Tang, Xiaoting, Li, Mingzhi, Wan, Jinglin",2020,PloS one,1

The aim ofthe present study was to evaluate the gastroprotective activity of juanislamin,isolated from Calea urticifolia, in a rat model of ethanol-induced gastriclesions. Thirty minutes after orally administering a given dose of juanislamin(from 1 to 30 mg/kg) or carbenoxolone (the reference drug, at 1-100 mg/kg) torats, 1 mL of ethanol was applied, and the animals were sacrificed 2 h later. Thestomachs were removed and opened to measure the total area of lesions in each. Toexamine the possible participation of prostaglandins, nitric oxide and/orsulfhydryl groups in the mechanism of action of juanislamin, the rats receivedindomethacin, NG-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME) orN-ethylmaleimide pretreatment, respectively, before being given juanislamin andundergoing the rest of the methodology. Juanislamin inhibited gastric lesionsproduced by ethanol in a non-dose-dependent manner, showing the maximumgastroprotective effect (100%) at 10 mg/kg. The activity of juanislamin was notmodified by pretreatment with indomethacin, l-NAME or N-ethylmaleimide. Inconclusion, juanislamin protected the gastric mucosa from ethanol-induced damage,and its mechanism of action apparently does not involve prostaglandins, nitricoxide or sulfhydryl groups.","Sánchez-Mendoza, María Elena, López-Lorenzo, Yaraset, Cruz-Antonio, Leticia, Cruz-Oseguera, Arturo, García-Machorro, Jazmín, Arrieta, Jesús",2020,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1
TA059988,10.1155/2020/2940746,Gentiopicroside Ameliorates Oxidative Stress and Lipid Accumulation throughNuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 Activation.,"The activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is closelyrelated to the alleviation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) byregulating oxidative stress and lipid homeostasis. Gentiopicroside (GPS), aniridoid glycoside found in the Gentianaceae, possesses anti-inflammatory andantioxidant effects. However, the protective effects of GPS on lipid accumulationand oxidative damage have not been investigated thoroughly in free fatty acid-(FFA-) induced HepG2 cells and tyloxapol- (Ty-) induced hyperlipidemia mice. Cellcounting kit-8 assays, Oil Red O staining, Western blotting analysis, extractionof nuclear and cytosolic proteins, and biochemical index assay were employed toexplore the mechanisms by which GPS exerts a protective effect on FFA-inducedHepG2 cells and Ty-induced hyperlipidemia mouse model. This paper demonstratesthat GPS could effectively alleviate NAFLD by elevating cell viability, reducingfatty deposition, downregulating TG, and activating nucleus Nrf2 in FFA-inducedHepG2 cells. Meanwhile, GPS significantly regulated the activation ofphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway, Nrf2 antioxidantpathway, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and GPS-inhibitedsterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) expression inFFA-stimulated lipid accumulation of HepG2 cells and Ty-treated mice.Interestingly, we highlight that PI3K/AKT inhibitor (LY294002) markedly increasedthe expression of Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, PPARα, and downregulated SREBP-1c inFFA-stimulated HepG2 cells. For these reasons, we found that the deletion of Nrf2could lose the protective effects of GPS on the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway andPPARα activation and SREBP-1c inactivation in FFA-stimulated HepG2 cells andTy-treated mice. GPS treatment had no effect on abnormal lipogenesis andantioxidant enzymes in Ty-induced Nrf2(-/-) mice. This work gives a newexplanation that GPS may be a useful therapeutic strategy for NAFLD throughupregulation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, which can alleviate oxidativedamage and lipid accumulation.","Jin, Meiyu, Feng, Haihua, Wang, Yue, Yan, Siru, Shen, Bingyu, Li, Zheng, Qin, Haiyan, Wang, Qi, Li, Jinxia, Liu, Guowen",2020,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,1

We previouslyfound that catalpol, an iridoid glucoside extracted from the root of Romaniaglutinosa L, protected against diabetes-induced hepatic oxidative stress. Here,we found that the increased expression of p66shc was observed in NAFLD models andcatalpol could inhibit p66shc expression to ameliorate NAFLD effectively.However, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. The aim of the present studywas to investigate the p66shc-targeting miRNAs in regulating oxidative stress andhepatic steatosis, also the mechanisms of catalpol inhibiting NAFLD. We foundthat the effects of catalpol inhibiting hepatic oxidative stress and steasis aredependent on inhibiting P66Shc expression. In addition, miR-96-5p was able tosuppress p66shc/cytochrome C cascade via targeting p66shc mRNA 3'UTR, andcatalpol could lead to suppression of NAFLD via upregulating miR-96-5p level.Thus, catalpol was effective in ameliorating NAFLD, andmiR-96-5p/p66shc/cytochrome C cascade might be a potential target.","Zhang, Yukun, Wang, Changyuan, Lu, Jiawei, Jin, Yue, Xu, Canyao, Meng, Qiang, Liu, Qi, Dong, Deshi, Ma, Xiaodong, Liu, Kexin, Sun, Huijun",2020,Aging,1
TA060040,10.3390/ijms21082729,Pro-Apoptotic Function Analysis of the Reaper Homologue IBM1 in Spodopterafrugiperda.,"As an important type of programmed cell death, apoptosis plays a critical role inlepidopteran insects in response to various internal and external stresses. It iscontrolled by a network of genes such as those encoding the inhibitor ofapoptosis proteins. However, there are few studies on apoptosis-related genes inSpodoptera frugiperda. In this study, an orthologue to the Drosophila reapergene, named Sf-IBM1, was identified from S. frugiperda, and a full-lengthsequence was obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)and rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR (RACE-PCR). The expression pattern ofSf-IBM1 was determined in different developmental stages and various tissues.Apoptotic stimuli including azadirachtin, camptothecin, and ultraviolet radiation(UV) induced the expression of Sf-IBM1 at both transcript and protein levels.Overexpression of Sf-IBM1 induced apoptosis in Sf9 cells, and the Sf-IBM1 proteinwas localized in mitochondria. The apoptosis induced by Sf-IBM1 could be blockedby the caspase universal inhibitorcarbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK) andSf-IAP1. Our results provide valuable information that should contribute to abetter understanding of the molecular events that lead to apoptosis inlepidopterans.","Shu, Benshui, Zhang, Jingjing, Veeran, Sethuraman, Zhong, Guohua",2020,International journal of molecular sciences,1
TA060051,10.1007/s00262-019-02469-8,Suppressive activity of Vδ2(+) γδ T cells on αβ T cells is licensed by TCRsignaling and correlates with signal strength.,"Despite recent progress in the understanding of γδ T cells' roles and functions,their interaction with αβ T cells still remains to be elucidated. In this study,we sought to clarify what precisely endows peripheral Vδ2(+) T cells withimmunosuppressive function on autologous αβ T cells. We found that negativelyfreshly isolated Vδ2(+) T cells do not exhibit suppressive behavior, even afterstimulation with IL-12/IL-18/IL-15 or the sheer contact withbutyrophilin-3A1-expressing tumor cell lines (U251 or SK-Mel-28). On the otherhand, Vδ2(+) T cells positively isolated through TCR crosslinking or afterprolonged stimulation with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) mediate stronginhibitory effects on αβ T cell proliferation. Stimulation with IPP in thepresence of IL-15 induces the most robust suppressive phenotype of Vδ2(+) Tcells. This indicates that Vδ2(+) T cells' suppressive activity is dependent on aTCR signal and that the degree of suppression correlates with its strength.Vδ2(+) T cell immunosuppression does not correlate with their Foxp3 expressionbut rather with their PD-L1 protein expression, evidenced by the massivereduction of suppressive activity when using a blocking antibody. In conclusion,pharmacologic stimulation of Vδ2(+) T cells via the Vδ2 TCR for activation andexpansion induces Vδ2(+) T cells' potent killer activity while simultaneouslylicensing them to suppress αβ T cell responses. Taken together, the study is afurther step to understand-in more detail-the suppressive activity of Vδ2(+) γδ Tcells.","Schilbach, Karin, Krickeberg, Naomi, Kaißer, Carlotta, Mingram, Simon, Kind, Janika, Siegers, Gabrielle M, Hashimoto, Hisayoshi",2020,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",1

In this work, we investigated the use of threedifferent non-conventional yeasts belonging to Lachancea thermotolerans,Wickerhamomyces anomalus, and Zygotorulaspora florentina species in pure andmixed fermentation with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae commercial starter US-05.All three non-conventional yeasts were competitive in co-cultures with the S.cerevisiae, and they dominated fermentations with 1:20 ratio (S.cerevisiae/non-conventional yeasts ratios). Pure non-conventional yeasts andco-cultures affected significantly the beer aroma. A general reduction inacetaldehyde content in all mixed fermentations was found. L. thermotolerans andZ. florentina in mixed and W. anomalus in pure cultures increased higheralcohols. L. thermotolerans led to a large reduction in pH value, producing, inpure culture, a large amount of lactic acid (1.83 g/L) while showing anenhancement of ethyl butyrate and ethyl acetate in all pure and mixedfermentations. W. anomalus decreased the main aroma compounds in comparison withthe S. cerevisiae but showed a significant increase in ethyl butyrate and ethylacetate.

TA060086,10.1186/s13104-019-4222-3,A genetical metabolomics approach for bioprospecting plant biosynthetic geneclusters.,"OBJECTIVE: Plants produce a plethora of specialized metabolites to defendthemselves against pathogens and insects, to attract pollinators and tocommunicate with other organisms. Many of these are also applied in the clinicand in agriculture. Genes encoding the enzymes that drive the biosynthesis ofthese metabolites are sometimes physically grouped on the chromosome, in regionscalled biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Several algorithms have been developedto identify plant BGCs, but a large percentage of predicted gene clusters uponfurther inspection do not show coexpression or do not encode a single functionalbiosynthetic pathway. Hence, further prioritization is needed. RESULTS: Here, weintroduce a strategy to systematically evaluate potential functions of predictedBGCs by superimposing their locations on metabolite quantitative trait loci(mQTLs). We show the feasibility of such an approach by integrating automated BGCprediction with mQTL datasets originating from a recombinant inbred line (RIL)population of Oryza sativa and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) ofArabidopsis thaliana. In these data, we identified several links for which theenzyme content of the BGCs matches well with the chemical features observed inthe metabolite structure, suggesting that this method can effectively guidebioprospecting of plant BGCs.","Witjes, Lotte, Kooke, Rik, van der Hooft, Justin J J, de Vos, Ric C H, Keurentjes, Joost J B, Medema, Marnix H, Nijveen, Harm",2019,BMC research notes,1

Thedisease is widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean olive-growing regionand is one of the major limiting factors of olive oil production. Other thaneffects on crop yield, little is known about the effect of the disease on thecontent of volatile compounds and phenolics that are produced during the oilextraction process and determine virgin olive oil (VOO) quality and commercialvalue. Here, we aim to study the effect of Verticillium wilt of the olive tree onthe content of phenolic and volatile compounds related to the sensory propertiesof VOO. Results showed that synthesis of six and five straight-chain carbonvolatile compounds were higher and lower, respectively, in oils extracted frominfected trees. Pathogen infection affected volatile compounds known to becontributors to VOO aroma: average content of one of the main positivecontributors to VOO aroma, (E)-hex-2-enal, was 38% higher in oils extracted frominfected trees, whereas average content of the main unpleasant volatile compound,pent-1-en-3-one, was almost 50% lower. In contrast, there was a clear effect ofpathogen infection on the content of compounds responsible for VOO taste, whereaverage content of the main bitterness contributor, oleuropein aglycone, was 18%lower in oil extracted from infected plants, and content of oleocanthal, the maincontributor to pungency, was 26% lower. We believe this is the first evidence ofthe effect of Verticillium wilt infection of olive trees on volatile compoundsand phenolics that are responsible of the aroma, taste, and commercial value ofVOO.","Landa, Blanca B, Pérez, Ana G, Luaces, Pilar, Montes-Borrego, Miguel, Navas-Cortés, Juan A, Sanz, Carlos",2019,Frontiers in plant science,1
TA060214,10.1186/s12870-019-2116-0,Rice defense responses are induced upon leaf rolling by an insect herbivore.,"BACKGROUND: Plant defense against herbivores begins with perception. The earlierplant detects the harm, the greater plant will benefit in its arm race with theherbivore. Before feeding, the larvae of the rice pest Cnaphalocrocis medinalis,initially spin silk and fold up a leaf. Rice can detect and protect itselfagainst C. medinalis feeding. However, whether rice could perceive C. medinalisleaf rolling behavior is currently unknown. Here, we evaluated the role of leafrolling by C. medinalis and artificial leaf rolling in rice plant defense and itsindirect effect on two important C. medinalis parasitoids (Itoplectis naranyaeand Apanteles sp.) through a combination of volatile profiling,gene-transcriptional and phytohormonal profiling. RESULTS: Natural leaf rollingby C. medinalis resulted in an increased attraction of I. naranyae when comparedto the undamaged plant after 12 h. Volatile analysis revealed that six out of atotal 22 components significantly increased in the headspace of C. medinalisrolled plant when compared to undamaged plant. Principal component analysis ofthese components revealed similarities in the headspace of undamaged plant andartificially rolled plant while the headspace volatiles of C. medinalis rolledplant deferred significantly. Leaf rolling and feeding by C. medinalisup-regulated the plant transcriptome and a series of jasmonic acid (JA) andsalicylic acid (SA) related genes. While feeding significantly increased JA levelafter 12 to 36 h, rolling significantly increased SA level after 2 to 12 h.Compared to artificial rolling, natural rolling significantly increased JA levelafter 36 h and SA level after 2 and 12 h. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest thatnatural leaf rolling by C. medinalis can be perceived by rice plant. Thedetection of this behavior may serve as an early warning signal in favor of therice plant defenses against C. medinalis.","Shi, Jin-Hua, Sun, Ze, Hu, Xin-Jun, Jin, Huanan, Foba, Caroline Ngichop, Liu, Hao, Wang, Chao, Liu, Le, Li, Feng-Feng, Wang, Man-Qun",2019,BMC plant biology,1

Aronia melanocarpa, a member of the family Rosaceae and native toNorth America and Eastern Canada, is rich in ursolic acid. In this study, weexamined the effects of A. melanocarpa extract (AME) supplementation on themTORC1 signaling pathway and muscle degradation-related factors in rats, bothalone and in combination with resistance exercise. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawleyrats were divided into AME and normal chow (NOR) groups. AME group was fed chowproviding a dose of 3 g/kg of AME and 115 mg/kg of ursolic acid for 7 days,whereas NOR rats were fed normal powder chow. The right gastrocnemius muscle ofeach animal was isometrically exercised (5 sets of ten 3-s contractions, with a7-s interval between contractions and 3-min rest intervals between sets), whilethe left gastrocnemius muscle served as an internal control. Western blotting andreal-time polymerase chain reaction were used to assess expression of factorsinvolved in the mTORC1 signaling pathway and muscle degradation. RESULTS: At 1 hafter resistance exercise, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was significantly increasedby AME consumption. At 6 h after resistance exercise, AME consumptionsignificantly increased the phosphorylation of Akt, p70S6K, rpS6, and AMPK. Italso increased MAFbx expression. Furthermore, AME significantly increased thephosphorylation of p70S6K and rpS6 in response to resistance exercise. However,AME did not increase muscle protein synthesis (MPS) after resistance exercise.AME did not affect the expression of any of the mediators of protein degradation,with the exception of MAFbx. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary AME enhanced mTORC1 activationin response to resistance exercise without increasing MPS. Moreover, it neitheraccelerated muscle protein degradation nor otherwise negatively affected proteinmetabolism. Further study is needed to clarify the effect of the combination ofAME and chronic resistance training on muscle hypertrophy.","Makanae, Yuhei, Ato, Satoru, Kido, Kohei, Fujita, Satoshi",2019,Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition,1

Thearchaeological evidence for ritualized consumption of cannabis is limited andcontentious. Here, we present some of the earliest directly dated andscientifically verified evidence for ritual cannabis smoking. This phytochemicalanalysis indicates that cannabis plants were burned in wooden braziers duringmortuary ceremonies at the Jirzankal Cemetery (ca. 500 BCE) in the eastern Pamirsregion. This suggests cannabis was smoked as part of ritual and/or religiousactivities in western China by at least 2500 years ago and that the cannabisplants produced high levels of psychoactive compounds.","Ren, Meng, Tang, Zihua, Wu, Xinhua, Spengler, Robert, Jiang, Hongen, Yang, Yimin, Boivin, Nicole",2019,Science advances,1

It isa form in which lutein is present in nature and is produced by freenon-esterification and fatty acid esterification. LE is one of the safe sourcesof lutein. Increasing lutein intake can prevent and treat age-related maculardegeneration. In addition, it can effectively inhibit gastric cancer, breastcancer, and esophageal cancer. However, the poor aqueous solubility of LE hasimpeded its clinical applications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was toprepare lutein ester nanoparticles (LE-NPs) by liquid antisolvent precipitationtechniques to improve the bioavailability of LE in vivo and improve eye deliveryefficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The physical characterization of LE-NPs wasperformed, and their in vitro dissolution rate, in vitro antioxidant capacity, invivo bioavailability, tissue distribution, and ocular pharmacokinetics werestudied and evaluated. RESULTS: The LE freeze-dried powder obtained under theoptimal conditions possessed a particle size of ~164.1±4.3 nm. The physicalcharacterization analysis indicated the amorphous form of LE-NPs. In addition,the solubility and dissolution rate of LE-NPs in artificial gastric juice were12.75 and 9.65 times that of the raw LE, respectively. The bioavailability ofLE-NPs increased by 1.41 times compared with that of the raw LE. The antioxidantcapacity of LE-NPs was also superior to the raw LE. The concentration of luteinin the main organs of rats treated with the LE-NPs was higher than that in ratstreated with the raw LE. The bioavailability of LE-NPs in rat eyeballs was foundto be 2.34 times that of the original drug.

TA060416,10.3390/plants9010004,Short-Term Post-Harvest Stress that Affects Profiles of Volatile OrganicCompounds and Gene Expression in Rocket Salad During Early Post-HarvestSenescence.,"Once harvested, leaves undergo a process of senescence which shares some featureswith developmental senescence. These include changes in gene expression,metabolites, and loss of photosynthetic capacity. Of particular interest in freshproduce are changes in nutrient content and the aroma, which is dependent on theprofile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Leafy salads are subjected tomultiple stresses during and shortly after harvest, including mechanical damage,storage or transport under different temperature regimes, and low light. Theseare thought to impact on later shelf life performance by altering the progress ofpost-harvest senescence. Short term stresses in the first 24 h after harvest weresimulated in wild rocket (Diplotaxis tenuifolia). These included dark (ambienttemperature), dark and wounding (ambient temperature), and storage at 4 °C indarkness. The effects of stresses were monitored immediately afterwards and afterone week of storage at 10 °C. Expression changes in two NAC transcription factors(orthologues of ANAC059 and ANAC019), and a gene involved in isothiocyanateproduction (thiocyanate methyltransferase, TMT) were evident immediately afterstress treatments with some expression changes persisting following storage.Vitamin C loss and microbial growth on leaves were also affected by stresstreatments. VOC profiles were differentially affected by stress treatments andthe storage period. Overall, short term post-harvest stresses affected multipleaspects of rocket leaf senescence during chilled storage even after a week.However, different stress combinations elicited different responses.","Spadafora, Natasha D, Cocetta, Giacomo, Ferrante, Antonio, Herbert, Robert J, Dimitrova, Simone, Davoli, Daniela, Fernández, Marta, Patterson, Valentine, Vozel, Tinkara, Amarysti, Canesia, Rogers, Hilary J, Müller, Carsten T",2019,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",1

We investigated whether dietary lutein/zeaxanthin intake affectscolorectal cancer risk in patients with a DICER1 rs3742330 polymorphism. In thishospital-based case-control study, we recruited 923 colorectal cancer patientsand 1,846 controls based on eligibility criteria, a semiquantitative foodfrequency questionnaire and the DICER1 rs3742330 genotype. Odds ratios (ORs) and95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logisticregression adjusted for confounders. The highest quartile of lutein/zeaxanthinconsumption was inversely associated with a reduced colorectal cancer risk (OR,95% CI = 0.25, 0.18-0.36). Carrying G allele (AG + GG) showed a significantlyreduced colorectal cancer incidence compared with that of AA carriers (OR, 95%CI = 0.71, 0.55-0.91). Those carrying the G allele (AG + GG) along with highlutein/zeaxanthin consumption were markedly associated with a decreasedcolorectal cancer risk (OR, 95% CI = 0.32, 0.22-0.46, P for interaction = 0.018),particularly for rectal cancer (OR, 95% CI = 0.24, 0.15-0.39, P forinteraction = 0.004), compared with that of AA carriers with lowlutein/zeaxanthin intakes.

TA060501,10.1128/AEM.01825-18,Trichoderma atroviride from Predator to Prey: Role of the Mitogen-ActivatedProtein Kinase Tmk3 in Fungal Chemical Defense against Fungivory by Drosophilamelanogaster Larvae.,"The response to injury represents an important strategy for animals and plants tosurvive mechanical damage and predation. Plants respond to injury by activating adefense response that includes the production of an important variety ofcompounds that help them withstand predator attack and recover from mechanicalinjury (MI). Similarly, the filamentous fungus Trichoderma atroviride responds toMI by strongly modifying its transcriptional profile and producing asexualreproduction structures (conidia). Here, we analyzed whether the response to MIin T. atroviride is related to a possible predator defense mechanism from ametabolic perspective. We found that the production of specific groups ofsecondary metabolites increases in response to MI but is reduced after fungivoryby Drosophila melanogaster larvae. We further show that fungivory results inrepression of the expression of genes putatively involved in the regulation ofsecondary metabolite production in T. atroviride Activation of secondarymetabolite production appears to depend on the mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) Tmk3. Interestingly, D. melanogaster larvae preferred to feed on a tmk3gene replacement mutant rather than on the wild-type strain. Consumption of themutant strain, however, resulted in increased larval mortality.IMPORTANCE Fungi,like other organisms, have natural predators, including fungivorous nematodes andarthropods that use them as an important food source. Thus, they requiremechanisms to detect and respond to injury. Trichoderma atroviride responds tomycelial injury by rapidly regenerating its hyphae and developing asexualreproduction structures. Whether this injury response is associated with attackby fungivorous insects is unknown. Therefore, determining the possibleconservation of a defense mechanism to predation in T. atroviride and plants andelucidating the mechanisms involved in the establishment of this response is ofmajor interest. Here, we describe the chemical response of T. atroviride tomechanical injury and fungivory and the role of a MAPK pathway in the regulationof this response.","Atriztán-Hernández, Karina, Moreno-Pedraza, Abigail, Winkler, Robert, Markow, Therese, Herrera-Estrella, Alfredo",2019,Applied and environmental microbiology,1
TA060518,10.1038/s41598-019-39615-2,Multiple molecular defense strategies in Brachypodium distachyon surmount Hessianfly (Mayetiola destructor) larvae-induced susceptibility for plant survival.,"The Hessian fly is a destructive pest of wheat causing severe economic damage.Numerous genes and associated biological pathways have been implicated in defenseagainst Hessian fly. However, due to limited genetic resources, compounded withgenome complexity, functional analysis of the candidate genes are challenging inwheat. Physically, Brachypodium distachyon (Bd) exhibits nonhost resistance toHessian fly, and with a small genome size, short life cycle, vast geneticresources and amenability to transformation, it offers an alternate functionalgenomic model for deciphering plant-Hessian fly interactions. RNA-sequencing wasused to reveal thousands of Hessian fly-responsive genes in Bd one, three, andfive days after egg hatch. Genes encoding defense proteins, stress-regulatingtranscription factors, signaling kinases, and secondary metabolites were stronglyup-regulated within the first 24 hours of larval feeding indicating an earlydefense, similar to resistant wheat. Defense was mediated by a hypersensitiveresponse that included necrotic lesions, up-regulated ROS-generating and-scavenging enzymes, and H(2)O(2) production. Suppression of cell wall-associatedproteins and increased cell permeability in Bd resembled susceptible wheat. Thus,Bd molecular responses shared similarities to both resistant and susceptiblewheat, validating its suitability as a model genome for undertaking functionalstudies of candidate Hessian fly-responsive genes.","Subramanyam, Subhashree, Nemacheck, Jill A, Hargarten, Andrea M, Sardesai, Nagesh, Schemerhorn, Brandon J, Williams, Christie E",2019,Scientific reports,1
TA060563,10.1371/journal.pone.0221436,"Carotenoid-based coloration predicts both longevity and lifetime fecundity inmale birds, but testosterone disrupts signal reliability.","Sexual selection promotes the evolution of conspicuous animal ornaments. Toevolve as signals, these traits must reliably express the ""quality"" of thebearer, an indicator of individual fitness. Direct estimates of individualfitness may include the contribution of longevity and fecundity. However,evidence of a correlation between the level of signal expression and these twofitness components are scarce, at least among vertebrates. Relative fitness isdifficult to assess in the wild as age at death and extra-pair paternity ratesare often unknown. Here, in captive male red-legged partridges, we show thatcarotenoid-based ornament expression, i.e., redness of the bill and eye rings, atthe beginning of reproductive life predicts both longevity (1-7 years) andlifetime breeding output (offspring number and hatching success). The recentlyproposed link between the individual capacity to produce red (keto) carotenoidpigments and the efficiency of cell respiration could, ultimately, explain thecorrelation with lifespan and, indirectly, fecundity. Nonetheless, in males ofavian species, carotenoid-based coloration in bare parts is also partiallycontrolled by testosterone. We also manipulated androgen levels throughout lifeby treating males with testosterone or antiandrogen compounds. Treatments causedcorrelations between signal levels and both fitness components to disappear, thusmaking the signals unreliable. This suggests that the evolution ofcarotenoid-based sexual signals requires a tightly-controlled steroid metabolism.","Cantarero, Alejandro, Pérez-Rodríguez, Lorenzo, Romero-Haro, Ana Ángela, Chastel, Olivier, Alonso-Alvarez, Carlos",2019,PloS one,1
TA060582,10.3390/biom9120873,"Retinoic Acid Signaling Is Associated with Cell Proliferation, Muscle CellDedifferentiation, and Overall Rudiment Size during Intestinal Regeneration inthe Sea Cucumber, Holothuria glaberrima.","Almost every organism has the ability of repairing damaged tissues or replacinglost and worn out body parts, nevertheless the degree of the responsesubstantially differs between each species. Adult sea cucumbers from theHolothuria glaberrima species can eviscerate various organs and the intestinalsystem is the first one to regenerate. This process involves the formation of ablastema-like structure that derives from the torn mesentery edges by theintervention of specific cellular processes (e.g., cell dedifferentiation anddivision). Still, the genetic networks controlling the regenerative response inthis model system are just starting to be unraveled. In this work we examined ifand how the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway is involved in the regenerativeresponse of this deuterostome. We first identified and characterized theholothurian orthologs for short chain dehydrogenase/reductase 7 (SDR7) andaldehyde dehydrogenase family 8A1 (ALDH8A1), two enzymes respectively associatedwith retinaldehyde and RA anabolism. We then showed that the SDR7 transcript wasdifferentially expressed during specific stages of intestinal regeneration whileALDH8A1 did not show significant differences in regenerating tissues whencompared to those of normal (non-eviscerated) organisms. Finally, we investigatedthe consequences of modulating RA signaling during intestinal regeneration usingpharmacological tools. We showed that application of an inhibitor (citral) of theenzyme synthesizing RA or a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist (LE135)resulted in organisms with a significantly smaller intestinal rudiment whencompared to those treated with DMSO (vehicle). The two inhibitors caused areduction in cell division and cell dedifferentiation in the new regenerate whencompared to organisms treated with DMSO. Results of treatment with tazarotene (anRAR agonist) were not significantly different from the control. Taken together,these results suggest that the RA signaling pathway is regulating the cellularprocesses that are crucial for intestinal regeneration to occur. Thus, RA mightbe playing a role in echinoderm regeneration that is similar to what has beendescribed in other animal systems.","Viera-Vera, Jorge, García-Arrarás, José E",2019,Biomolecules,1

Don)genes responding to parthenocarpy induced by GA3 through transcriptome analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Fruit set after successful pollination is key for the production ofsweet cherries, and a low fruit-setting rate is the main problem in production ofthis crop. As gibberellin treatment can directly induce parthenogenesis andsatisfy the hormone requirement during fruit growth and development, suchtreatment is an important strategy for improving the fruit-setting rate of sweetcherries. Previous studies have mainly focused on physiological aspects, such asfruit quality, fruit size, and anatomical structure, whereas the molecularmechanism remains clear. RESULTS: In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of'Meizao' sweet cherry fruit treated with gibberellin during the anthesis andhard-core periods to identify genes associated with parthenocarpic fruit set. Atotal of 25,341 genes were identified at the anthesis and hard-core stages, 765(681 upregulated, 84 downregulated) and 186 (141 upregulated, 45 downregulated)of which were significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the anthesisand the hard-core stages after gibberellin 3 (GA3) treatment, respectively. Basedon DEGs between the control and GA3 treatments, the GA3 response mainly involvesparthenocarpic fruit set and cell division. Exogenous gibberellin stimulatedsweet cherry fruit parthenocarpy and enlargement, as verified by qRT-PCR resultsof related genes as well as the parthenocarpic fruit set and fruit size. Based onour research and previous studies in Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified keygenes associated with parthenocarpic fruit set and cell division. Interestingly,we observed patterns among sweet cherry fruit setting-related DEGs, especiallythose associated with hormone balance, cytoskeleton formation and cell wallmodification. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the result provides a possible molecularmechanism regulating parthenocarpic fruit set that will be important for basicresearch and industrial development of sweet cherries.","Wen, Binbin, Song, Wenliang, Sun, Mingyue, Chen, Min, Mu, Qin, Zhang, Xinhao, Wu, Qijie, Chen, Xiude, Gao, Dongsheng, Wu, Hongyu",2019,BMC genetics,1

Inthe current study, we explored a mechanism by which ginsenoside Rb1 could protectthese cells via binding of estrogen receptors (ERs). We found that several humanendothelial cell lines differentially expressed ER-β and had very low levels ofER-α. RTV treatment significantly increased the production of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) and decreased the expression of endothelial nitric oxidase synthase(eNOS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in HUVECs, while Rb1 effectively blockedthese effects of RTV. These effects of Rb1 were effectively inhibited bysilencing ER-β, indicating that ginsenoside Rb1 requires ER-β for its antioxidantactivity in inhibiting the deleterious effect of RTV in human endothelial cells.Furthermore, Rb1 specifically activated ER-β transactivation activity by ER-βluciferase reporter assay. Rb1 competitively bound to ER-β, which was determinedby the high sensitive fluorescent polarization assay.","Lü, Jian-Ming, Jiang, Jun, Jamaluddin, Md Saha, Liang, Zhengdong, Yao, Qizhi, Chen, Changyi",2019,International journal of molecular sciences,1

These pathogens mainlyattack Eucalyptus, a tree with a diversity of secondary metabolites employed asdefense-related phytoalexins. To unravel the fungal adaptive mechanisms tovarious phytoalexins, we examined the genome of C. pseudoreteaudii, which is oneof the most aggressive pathogens in southeast Asia. RESULTS: A 63.7 Mb genomewith 14,355 coding genes of C. pseudoreteaudii were assembled. Genomiccomparisons identified 1785 species-specific gene families in C. pseudoreteaudii.Most of them were not annotated and those annotated genes were enriched inpeptidase activity, pathogenesis, oxidoreductase activity, etc. RNA-seq showedthat 4425 genes were differentially expressed on the eucalyptus(the resistantcultivar E. grandis×E.camaldulensis M1) tissue induced medium. The annotation ofGO term and KEGG pathway indicated that some of the differential expression geneswere involved in detoxification and transportation, such as genes encoding ABCtransporters, degrading enzymes of aromatic compounds and so on. CONCLUSIONS:Potential genomic determinants of phytoalexin detoxification were identified inC. pseudoreteaudii by comparison with 13 other fungi. This pathogen seems toemploy membrane transporters and degradation enzymes to detoxify Eucalyptusphytoalexins. Remarkably, the Calonectria genome possesses a surprising number ofsecondary metabolism backbone enzyme genes involving toxin biosynthesis. It isalso especially suited for cutin and lignin degradation. This indicates thattoxin and cell wall degrading enzymes may act important roles in theestablishment of Calonectria leaf blight. This study provides furtherunderstanding on the mechanism of pathogenesis in Calonectria.","Ye, Xiaozhen, Zhong, Zhenhui, Liu, Hongyi, Lin, Lianyu, Guo, Mengmeng, Guo, Wenshuo, Wang, Zonghua, Zhang, Qinghua, Feng, Lizhen, Lu, Guodong, Zhang, Feiping, Chen, Quanzhu",2018,BMC genomics,1

The statistical treatment of such profiles often iscomplicated due to their diversity as well as the intra- and interspecificvariability in the quantitative and qualitative composition of secondarymetabolites. Most importantly, the assumption of independence of thepresence/absence and the quantity of compounds is violated due to the sharedbiosynthetic origin of many compounds. Therefore, I propose a biosyntheticallyinformed pairwise distance measure that fully considers the biosynthesis of thecompounds and thus quantifies the similarity in the enzymatic equipment of twosamples. The biosynthetic similarity of compounds is calculated based on theproportion of shared enzymes that are required for their biosynthesis. Using thisinformation (provided as dendrogram structure) and the quantitative compositionof the samples, generalized UniFrac distances are calculated measuring thatfraction of the dendrogram (i.e., the branch lengths) that is unique to either ofthe samples but not shared by both samples. To allow a straightforwardcross-platform application of the approach, I provide functions for thestatistical software R and sample data sets. A hypothetical and a real worldexample show the feasibility of the biosynthetically informed distances d(A,B)and highlight the differences to conventional distance measures.

The present study wasdesigned to evaluate the protective effects of amarogentin on carbontetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in vivo and the underlying mechanism.Fibrosis was induced by subcutaneous injections of 6 mL/kg of 20% carbontetrachloride (dissolved in olive oil) twice per week for seven weeks. Mice wereorally treated with 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg amarogentin and with colchicine as apositive control. Biochemical assays and histopathological investigations showedthat amarogentin delayed the formation of liver fibrosis; decreased alanineaminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, malondialdehyde and hydroxyprolinelevels; and increased albumin, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, glutathioneperoxidase, and superoxide dismutase levels. Moreover, amarogentin exhibiteddownregulation of α-smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor-β₁ levelsin immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses. The levels of phosphorylatedextracellular regulated protein kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 werealso significantly reduced in all amarogentin-treated groups in a dose-dependentmanner. These findings demonstrated that amarogentin exerted significanthepatoprotective effects against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis inmice and suggested that the effect of amarogentin against liver fibrosis may beby anti-oxidative properties and suppressing the mitogen-activated protein kinasesignalling pathway.","Zhang, Ya, Zhao, Hang, Li, Hua, Cao, Wei, Wang, Fang, Zhang, Tian, Wang, Si-Wang",2017,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",1

Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) combine the advantages of bothpolymeric nanoparticles and liposomes into a single delivery platform. In thisstudy, we engineered LPNs as the co-delivery system of paclitaxel (PTX) andtriptolide (TL) to achieve synergistic therapeutic effect and reduced drugresistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, PTX- and TL-coloaded LPNs(P/T-LPNs) were fabricated by nanoprecipitation method using lipid and polymericmaterials. The P/T-LPNs combination effects on human lung cancer cells werestudied. Therapeutic potentials of P/T-LPNs were further determined using lungcancer cells-bearing mice model. RESULTS: The average particle sizes of LPNs werearound 160 nm, with narrow size distribution below 0.2. The zeta potential valueof LPNs was about -30 mV. The encapsulating efficiency (EE) of PTX and TL loadedin LPNs was over 85%. The cytotoxicity of dual drug loaded LPNs was higher thansingle drug loaded LPNs. The combination therapy showed synergistic when PTX:TLweight ratio was 5:3, indicating the synergy effects of the LPNs. In vivo tumorgrowth curve of the experimental group was more gentle opposed to the controlgroup, and tumor volumes of P/T-LPNs and control group were 392 and 1,737 mm(3),respectively. The inhibition rate on day 20 was 77.4% in the P/T-LPNs group,which is higher than the free drugs solution.

For datarecording and analysis, a 12-week period was divided into 3 periods of 4 weeks'duration each: period 1 (54 to 57 weeks), period 2 (58 to 61 weeks), and period 3(62 to 65 weeks). For the diet supplemented with Enviva EO, hen-day eggproduction and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) were significantly improved(P < 0.05) at weeks 58 to 61, and the eggshell thickness was significantlyincreased (P < 0.05) at week 65. However, egg production, egg weight, feedintake, FCR and other egg quality parameters (albumen height, Haugh unit, eggyolk color and eggshell strength) were not affected by the dietary treatment. Inaddition, compared with the control diet, protein digestibility in the 100 mg/kgEnviva EO treatment group was significantly increased (P < 0.05), and fatdigestibility in the 100 and 150 mg/kg Enviva EO treatment groups wassignificantly decreased (P < 0.05), but Enviva EO had no effect on energyapparent digestibility. Saturated fatty acid (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid(MUFA) gradually decreased and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) increased withEnviva EO supplementation, but the difference was not significant. The datasuggested that the supplementation of essential oils (Enviva EO) in laying hendiet did not show a significant positive effect on performance and yolk fattyacid composition but it tended to increase eggshell thickness and proteindigestibility, especially at the dose of 50 mg/kg.","Ding, Xuemei, Yu, Yang, Su, Zhuowei, Zhang, Keying",2017,Animal nutrition (Zhongguo xu mu shou yi xue hui),1
TA061127,10.1007/s00270-018-2018-9,Drug Distribution and Basic Pharmacology of Paclitaxel/Resveratrol-Coated BalloonCatheters.,"PURPOSE: To experimentally investigate a new homogenouslypaclitaxel/resveratrol-coated balloon catheter in terms of transport of thecoating to the treated tissue and local effects including histology andfunctional tests. METHODS: Adherence of the coating to the balloon was exploredby in vitro simulation of its passage to the lesion. Paclitaxel and resveratroltransfer to the vessel wall was investigated in porcine coronary and peripheralarteries. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) was used for directmicroscopic visualization of paclitaxel in arterial tissue. Inhibition ofneointimal proliferation and tolerance of complete coating and resveratrol-onlycoating was investigated in pigs 4 weeks after treatment, and the effect ofresveratrol on inflammation and healing after 3 and 7 days. RESULTS: Drug loss onthe way to the lesion was < 10% of dose, while 65 ± 13% was detected at the siteof balloon inflation. After treatment similar proportions of drug were detectedin coronary and peripheral arteries, i.e., 7.4 ± 4.6% of dose or 125 ± 74 ng/mgtissue. MALDI showed circumferential deposition. Inhibition of neointimalproliferation by paclitaxel/resveratrol coating was significant (p = 0.001)whereas resveratrol-only coating did not inhibit neointimal proliferation. Duringthe first week after treatment of peripheral arteries with resveratrol-onlyballoons, we observed nominally less inflammation and fibrin deposition alongwith a significant macrophage reduction and more pronouncedre-endothelialization. No safety issues emerged including left ventricularejection fraction for detection of potential distal embolization after high-dosetreatment of coronary arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel/resveratrol-coatedballoons were effective and safe in animal studies. Beyond acting as excipientresveratrol may contribute to vascular healing.","Speck, Ulrich, Häckel, Akvile, Schellenberger, Eyk, Kamann, Stefanie, Löchel, Melanie, Clever, Yvonne P, Peters, Daniel, Scheller, Bruno, Trog, Sabrina, Bettink, Stephanie",2018,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,1

Cablin patchouliherb (CPH), Atractylodes rhizome (AR), Amur Cork-tree (AC) and Cypsum were mixedwith the weight ratios of 1:1:1:0.5 and 1:1:1:1 to make up TCMC1 and TCMC2,respectively. Both TCMC were added at level of 25 g/kg of substrate dry matter.In vitro gas production was recorded and methane concentration was determined at12 and 24 h of incubation. After 24 h, the incubation was terminated and theinoculants were measured for pH, ammonia nitrogen, volatile fatty acids (VFA).Total deoxyribonucleic acid of ruminal microbes was extracted from the inocula,and populations were determined by a real-time quantitative polymerase chainreaction. Populations of total rumen methanogens, protozoa, total fungi,Ruminococcus albus, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens wereexpressed as a proportion of total rumen bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleicacid. Compared with the control, the 2 TCMC decreased (P ≤ 0.05) total VFAconcentration, acetate molar proportion, acetate to propionate ratio, gas andmethane productions at 12 and 24 h, hydrogen (H) produced and consumed, andmethanogens and total fungi populations, while the 2 TCMC increased (P ≤ 0.05)propionate molar proportion. Traditional Chinese medicine compound 1 alsodecreased (P ≤ 0.05) R. flavefaciens population. From the present study, it isinferred that there is an effect of the TCMC in suppressing methanogenesis,probably mediated via indirect mode by channeling H(2) utilized formethanogenesis to synthesis of propionate and direct action against the rumenmicrobes involved in methane formation. In addition, the relative methanereduction potential (RMRP) of TCMC2 was superior to that of TCMC1.","Wang, Shui Ping, Wang, Wen Juan, Tan, Zhi Liang, Liu, Guo Wei, Zhou, Cheng Fu, Yin, Meng Jie",2019,Animal nutrition (Zhongguo xu mu shou yi xue hui),1

In this study, GE11 peptide-conjugated Se NPs (GE11-Se NPs), ananosystem targeting EGFR over-expressed cancer cells, were synthesized fororidonin delivery to achieve enhanced anticancer efficacy. Oridonin loaded andGE11 peptide conjugated Se NPs (GE11-Ori-Se NPs) were found to show enhancedcellular uptake in cancer cells, which resulted in enhanced cancer inhibitionagainst cancer cells and reduced toxicity against normal cells. Afteraccumulation into the lysosomes of cancer cells and increase of oridonin releaseunder acid condition, GE11-Ori-Se NPs were further transported into cytoplasmafter the damage of lysosomal membrane integrity. GE11-Ori-Se NPs were found toinduce cancer cell apoptosis by inducting reactive oxygen species (ROS)production, activating mitochondria-dependent pathway, inhibiting EGFR-mediatedPI3K/AKT and inhibiting Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. GE11-Se NPs were also found toshow active targeting effects against the tumor tissue in esophageal cancerbearing mice. And in nude mice xenograft model, GE11-Ori-Se NPs significantlyinhibited the tumor growth via inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by reducing theangiogenesis-marker CD31 and activation of the immune system by enhancing IL-2and TNF-α production. The selenium contents in mice were found to accumulate intoliver, tumor, and kidney, but showed no significant toxicity against liver andkidney. This cancer-targeted design of Se NPs provides a new strategy forsynergistic treating of cancer with higher efficacy and reduced side effects,introducing GE11-Ori-Se NPs as a candidate for further evaluation as achemotherapeutic agent for EGFR over-expressed esophageal cancers.","Pi, Jiang, Jiang, Jinhuan, Cai, Huaihong, Yang, Fen, Jin, Hua, Yang, Peihui, Cai, Jiye, Chen, Zheng W",2017,Drug delivery,1
TA061259,10.18632/oncotarget.16703,Vacquinol-1 inducible cell death in glioblastoma multiforme is counter regulatedby TRPM7 activity induced by exogenous ATP.,"Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most malignant brain tumors in humans and have a verypoor prognosis. New therapeutic options are urgently needed. A novel drug,Vacquinol-1 (Vac), a quinolone derivative, displays promising properties byinducing rapid cell death in GBM but not in non-transformed tissues. Features ofthis type of cell death are compatible with a process termed methuosis. Here wetested Vac on a highly malignant glioma cell line observed by long-term videomicroscopy. Human dental-pulp stem cells (DPSCs) served as controls. A majorfinding was that an exogenous ATP concentration of as little as 1 μM counterregulated the Vac-induced cell death. Studies using carvacrol, an inhibitor oftransient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7),demonstrated that the ATP-inducible inhibitory effect is likely to be via TRPM7.Exogenous ATP is of relevance in GBM with large necrotic areas. Our resultssupport the use of GBM cultures with different grades of malignancy to addresstheir sensitivity to methuosis. The video-microscopy approach presented hereallows decoding of signaling pathways as well as mechanisms of chemotherapeuticresistance by long-term observation. Before implementing Vac as a noveltherapeutic drug in GBM, cells from each individual patient need to be assessedfor their ATP sensitivity. In summary, the current investigation supports theconcept of methuosis, described as non-apoptotic cell death and a promisingapproach for GBM treatment. Tissue-resident ATP/necrosis may interfere with thiscell-death pathway but can be overcome by a natural compound, carvacrol that evenpenetrates the blood-brain barrier.","Sander, Philip, Mostafa, Haouraa, Soboh, Ayman, Schneider, Julian M, Pala, Andrej, Baron, Ann-Kathrin, Moepps, Barbara, Wirtz, C Rainer, Georgieff, Michael, Schneider, Marion",2017,Oncotarget,1

In this study, we investigated the effects of PF on thekidneys of mice with streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus using TLR2knockout mice (TLR2(-/-)) and wild-type littermates (C57BL/6J-WT). After 12 weeksof intraperitoneal injection of PF at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg once a day,diabetic mice had significantly reduced albuminuria and attenuated renalhistopathology. These changes were associated with substantially alleviatedmacrophage infiltration and decreased expression of TLR2 signaling pathwaybiomarkers. These data support a role of TLR2 in promoting inflammation andindicate that the effect of PF is associated with the inhibition of the TLR2pathway in the kidneys of diabetic mice. PF thus shows therapeutic potential forthe prevention and treatment of DN.","Shao, Yun-Xia, Xu, Xing-Xin, Wang, Kun, Qi, Xiang-Ming, Wu, Yong-Gui",2017,"Drug design, development and therapy",1

Individual building blocks of peptidoglycan are assembled inthe cytoplasm on undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P) before being flipped to theperiplasmic face, where they are polymerized and transferred to the existing cellwall sacculus, resulting in the side product undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C55-PP).Interruption of UppP's regeneration of C55-P from C55-PP leads to the buildup ofcell wall intermediates and cell lysis. We present the crystal structure of UppPfrom Escherichia coli at 2.0 Å resolution, which reveals the mechanistic basisfor intramembranal phosphatase action and substrate specificity using an invertedtopology repeat. In addition, the observation of key structural motifs common toa variety of cross membrane transporters hints at a potential flippase functionin the specific relocalization of the C55-P product back to the cytosolic space.","Workman, Sean D, Worrall, Liam J, Strynadka, Natalie C J",2018,Nature communications,1
TA061327,10.1038/s41598-018-21946-1,An all-trans-retinal-binding opsin peropsin as a potential dark-active andlight-inactivated G protein-coupled receptor.,"Peropsin or retinal pigment epithelium-derived rhodopsin homolog, found in manyanimals, belongs to the opsin family. Most opsins bind to 11-cis-retinal as achromophore and act as light-activated G protein-coupled receptors. Someperopsins, however, bind all-trans-retinal and isomerise it into 11-cis form bylight, and peropsin has been suggested to supply other visual opsins with11-cis-retinal. Additionally, peropsin has some amino acid sequence motifs thatare highly conserved among G protein-coupled opsins. Here, using chimeric mutantperopsins, we found that peropsin potentially generates an ""active form"" thatdrives G-protein signalling in the dark by binding to all-trans-retinal and thatthe active form photo-converts to an inactive form containing 11-cis-retinal.Comparative spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that spider peropsin exhibitedcatalytic efficiency for retinal photoisomerisation that was much lower than aretinal photoisomerase, squid retinochrome. The chimeric peropsins, constructedby replacing the third intracellular loop region with that of Gs- or Gi-coupledopsin, were active and drove Gs- or Gi-mediated signalling in the dark,respectively, and were inactivated upon illumination in mammalian cultured cells.These results suggest that peropsin acts as a dark-active, light-inactivated Gprotein-coupled receptor and is useful as a novel optogenetic tool.","Nagata, Takashi, Koyanagi, Mitsumasa, Lucas, Robert, Terakita, Akihisa",2018,Scientific reports,1
TA061332,10.1038/srep44819,Beneficial effects of paeoniflorin on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease inducedby high-fat diet in rats.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent form of chronicliver diseases. This study sought to evaluate the insulin-sensitizing effect ofpaeoniflorin (PF) on high-fat diet-induced NAFLD and possible molecularmechanisms. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeksto establish the NAFLD model, and PF (20 mg/kg/d) was gavaged to the NAFLD ratsfor another four weeks. Our results demonstrated that HFD resulted inhepatocellular ballooning, micro-/macrovesicular steatosis, and oxidative stressin the liver, accompanied by increased serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride(TG), free fatty acid (FFA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartateaminotransferase (AST) levels and homeostasis model of insulin resistance(HOMA-IR) index. PF treatment improved the biochemical and histopathologicalchanges in NAFLD rats. Moreover, we also found that PF could inhibit lipidectopic deposition via regulating lipid metabolism (inhibiting lipid synthesis ofcholesterol and de novo pathway), and exert insulin sensitizing effect byregulating the insulin signaling pathway IRS/Akt/GSK3β and anti-oxidation. Thestudy findings suggest that PF has therapeutic potential against NAFLD and thatit acts through multiple signaling pathways.","Ma, Zhihong, Chu, Li, Liu, Hongying, Wang, Weijie, Li, Jieru, Yao, Wenzao, Yi, Jianfeng, Gao, Yue",2017,Scientific reports,1

It is probably one of the most species-rich, structurally complexand productive ecosystems in temperate waters and well-studied in terms oftrophic ecology. However, still little is known about the microorganisms thrivingin this habitat. A growing body of evidence suggests that bacteria associatedwith macro-algae represent a huge and largely untapped resource of naturalproducts with chemical structures that have been optimized by evolution forbiological and ecological purposes. Those microorganisms are most likelyattracted by algae through secretion of specific carbohydrates and proteins thattrigger them to attach to the algal surface and to form biofilms. The algae mightthen employ those bacteria as biofouling control, using their antimicrobialsecondary metabolites to defeat other bacteria or eukaryotes. We here analyzedbiofilm samples from the brown macro-algae Macrocystis pyrifera sampled inNovember 2014 in the kelp forest of Monterey Bay by a metagenomic shotgun andamplicon sequencing approach, focusing on Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia fromthe PVC superphylum. Although not very abundant, we were able to find novelPlanctomycetal and Verrucomicrobial species by an innovative binning approach.All identified species harbor secondary metabolite related gene clusters,contributing to our hypothesis that through inter-species interaction,microorganisms might have a substantial effect on kelp forest wellbeing and/ordisease-development.","Vollmers, John, Frentrup, Martinique, Rast, Patrick, Jogler, Christian, Kaster, Anne-Kristin",2017,Frontiers in microbiology,1
TA061357,10.1097/MD.0000000000010073,Hypertensive crisis with 2 target organ impairment induced by glycyrrhizin: Acase report.,"RATIONALE: Glycyrrhizin is the main active component of licorice. Licorice andglycyrrhizin induced hypertension has been widely reported, yet licorice andglycyrrhizin induced hypertensive crisis has been rarely known. PATIENT CONCERNS:The case of this report was a 47-year-old woman, who took 225 mg of glycyrrhizindaily for 3 years due to primary biliary cholangitis. She was found to have adramatically elevated blood pressure of about 230/110 mmHg without a history ofhypertension and was referred to the emergency department. DIAGNOSES:Hypokalemia, hypertensive retinopathy, and nephropathy were found during thefollowing work-up. Since no other risk factors of hypertension were identified,she was suspected to have glycyrrhizin induced pseudo-hyperaldosteronism.INTERVENTIONS: Glycyrrhizin was discontinued. Intravenous sodium nitroprussidewas used during the first few days. Nifedipine and irbesartan were taken afterdischarge, and the dosage was reduced gradually under supervision. OUTCOMES: Shestopped all the anti-hypertensive drugs 6 months since glycyrrhizin was stopped.Her blood pressure was about 110/60 mmHg after repetitive measurement. Her serumpotassium and urine albumin/creatinine ratio were also normalized. LESSONS:Licorice and glycyrrhizin induced hypertension due to pseudo-hyperaldosteronismhas been widely reported, yet only 3 cases reported that excessive consumption oflicorice could lead to hypertensive emergencies. This is the first case thatglycyrrhizin induced hypertensive crisis with target organ impairment. Bypresenting this case, we remind clinicians of glycyrrhizin induced hypertension,a condition which could lead to medical emergencies.","Li, Jing, Fan, Xiaoli, Wang, Qin",2018,Medicine,1
TA061372,10.3390/ijms19030912,Suppression Effect of Astaxanthin on Osteoclast Formation In Vitro and Bone LossIn Vivo.,"Osteoporosis is characterized by a reduction of the bone mineral density (BMD)and microarchitectural deterioration of the bone, which lead to bone fragilityand susceptibility to fracture. Astaxanthin (AST) has a variety of biologicalactivities, such as a protective effect against asthma or neuroinflammation,antioxidant effect, and decrease of the osteoclast number in the right mandiblesin the periodontitis model. Although treatment with AST is known to have aneffect on inflammation, no studies on the effect of AST exposure on bone losshave been performed. Thus, in the present study, we examined the antiosteoporoticeffect of AST on bone mass in ovariectomized (OVX) mice and its possiblemechanism of action. The administration of AST (5, 10 mg/kg) for 6 weekssuppressed the enhancement of serum calcium, inorganic phosphorus, alkalinephosphatase, total cholesterol, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)activity. The bone mineral density (BMD) and bone microarchitecture of thetrabecular bone in the tibia and femur were recovered by AST exposure. Moreover,in the in vitro experiment, we demonstrated that AST inhibits osteoclastformation through the expression of the nuclear factor of activated T cells(NFAT) c1, dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), TRAP, andcathepsin K without any cytotoxic effects on bone marrow-derived macrophages(BMMs). Therefore, we suggest that AST may have therapeutic potential for thetreatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.","Hwang, Yun-Ho, Kim, Kwang-Jin, Kim, Su-Jin, Mun, Seul-Ki, Hong, Seong-Gyeol, Son, Young-Jin, Yee, Sung-Tae",2018,International journal of molecular sciences,1

In this work, we demonstrated that PtFLA6, one ofpoplar TW-associated PtFLAs, was abundantly expressed in TW, and mainly localizedin differentiating G-fibers. The bended stems of PtFLA6 antisense transgenicpoplar showed decreased transcripts of PtFLAs, including PtFLA6, and reducedPtFLA6 like proteins, leading to inhibited TW differentiation and formation. Wealso showed that gibberellin A3 (GA(3)) was enriched in the xylem of TW side,accompanied with a lowered level of PtRGA1, a poplar DELLA protein. When GA(3)biosynthesis was restrained in the bended poplar stems by a GA biosynthesisinhibitor (daminozide), TW formation was obviously repressed, as a result ofrestricted PtRGA1 degradation, and reduced PtFLA6 like proteins and PtFLAexpression. Further studies indicated that PtFLAs were negatively regulated byPtRGA1. This study suggests that PtFLAs play important roles in the poplar TWformation, possibly regulated by GA signaling.","Wang, Haihai, Jin, Yanli, Wang, Cuiting, Li, Bei, Jiang, Chunmei, Sun, Zhencang, Zhang, Zhiping, Kong, Fanjing, Zhang, Hongxia",2017,Scientific reports,1

However, the roleof lycopene in the success rate of dental implants under osteopenic conditionsremains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether lycopene preventsdelayed implant osseointegration in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model. METHODS:Thirty female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the followinggroups: OVX with vehicle (OVX group), OVX with lycopene (OVX + lycopene group)and sham-operated with vehicle (sham group). Twelve weeks after ovariectomy orsham operation, titanium implants were placed into the distal metaphysis of thebilateral femurs of each rat. These rats were subsequently gavaged with lycopene(50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. After 12 weeks of gavage, all rats were sacrificed,and specimens were harvested. Sample osseointegration was evaluated bybiomechanical testing, 3D micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis andhistomorphometric analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the OVX group, theOVX + lycopene group showed a 69.3% increase in the maximum push-out force(p < 0.01). Micro-CT data for the femurs in the OVX + lycopene group showedsignificantly higher bone volume, trabecular thickness and less trabecular spacethan did those in the OVX group. The bone area (BA) around the implant and bonecontact (BC) with the implant were increased by 72.3% (p < 0.01) and 51.4%(p < 0.01) in the OVX + lycopene group, respectively, compared with those in theOVX group. There was no significant difference in the mechanical test, micro-CTscanning and histomorphometric data between the OVX + lycopene and sham groups(p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lycopene improved implant osseointegration, fixation andbone formation under osteopenic conditions, suggesting that lycopene is apromising therapeutic agent to prevent delayed implant osseointegration and boneloss under osteopenic conditions.","Li, Xiaojie, Xue, Wenli, Cao, Yong, Long, Yanming, Xie, Mengsheng",2018,Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,1
TA061538,10.1371/journal.pone.0203816,Daily zeaxanthin supplementation prevents atrophy of the retinal pigmentepithelium (RPE) in a mouse model of mitochondrial oxidative stress.,"Oxidative damage is implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related maculardegeneration (AMD). The dry form of AMD (geographic atrophy) is characterized byloss of RPE, photoreceptors, and macular pigments. The cumulative effects ofoxidative stress impact mitochondrial function in RPE. In Sod2flox/floxVMD2-cremice, the RPE specific deletion of Sod2, the gene for mitochondrial manganesesuperoxide dismutase (MnSOD), leads to elevated oxidative stress in retina andRPE, and causes changes in the RPE and underlying Bruch's membrane that sharesome features of AMD. This study tested the hypothesis that zeaxanthinsupplementation would reduce oxidative stress and preserve RPE structure andfunction in these mice. Zeaxanthin in retina/RPE/choroid and liver was quantifiedby LC/MS, retinal function and structure were evaluated by electroretinogram(ERG) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and antioxidantgene expression was measured by RT-PCR. After one month of supplementation,zeaxanthin levels were 5-fold higher in the retina/RPE/choroid and 12-fold higherin liver than in unsupplemented control mice. After four months ofsupplementation, amplitudes of the ERG a-wave (function of rod photoreceptors)and b-wave (function of the inner retina) were not different in supplemented andcontrol mice. In contrast, the c-wave amplitude (a measure of RPE function) was28% higher in supplemented mice than in control mice. Higher RPE/choroidexpression of antioxidant genes (Cat, Gstm1, Hmox1, Nqo1) and scaffolding proteinSqstm1 were found in supplemented mice than in unsupplemented controls. Reducednitrotyrosine content in the RPE/choroid was demonstrated by ELISA. Preliminaryassessment of retinal ultrastructure indicated that supplementation supportedbetter preservation of RPE structure with more compact basal infoldings andintact mitochondria. We conclude that daily zeaxanthin supplementation protectedRPE cells from mitochondrial oxidative stress associated with deficiency in theMnSOD and thereby improved RPE function early in the disease course.","Biswal, Manas R, Justis, Bradley D, Han, Pingyang, Li, Hong, Gierhart, Dennis, Dorey, Cheryl K, Lewin, Alfred S",2018,PloS one,1

SlCMB1 expression declined with the fruitripening from immature green to B + 7 (7 days after Breaker) fruits in the wildtype (WT) and was lower in Nr and rin mutants fruits. Tomato plants with reducedSlCMB1 mRNA displayed delayed fruit ripening, reduced ethylene production andcarotenoid accumulation. The ethylene production in SlCMB1-RNAi fruits decreasedby approximately 50% as compared to WT.
