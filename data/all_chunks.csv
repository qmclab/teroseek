TA038182_I_0001,"Glandular trichomes are key sites for producing pharmacologically important secondary metabolites like artemisinin, and understanding their biosynthetic pathways is crucial for metabolic engineering, but limited genomic data in non-model plants like A. annua hinders progress.","Secreting glandular trichomes (GTs) are a major site for biosynthesis and accumulation of a wide range of plant natural products. These plant natural products often function to protect the plants against insect predation, and contribute to the flavour and aroma of plants. Many of the natural products also have pharmacological effects, such as the analgesic drug morphine, the anticancer compound taxol, and the antimalarial drug artemisinin. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone, is currently recognized as one of the most prominent anti-malarial treatment. A complete understanding of the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway and its regulatory mechanism holds the key to efficient metabolic engineering for increased artemisinin yield. In the past decades, research efforts have been dedicated to identification of enzymes and intermediate compounds leading to artemisinin production. Many genes encoding enzymes participate in the pathway have been cloned and functionally characterized. However, little is known about the regulatory aspects of sesquiterpene metabolism. This is partly due to the fact that A. annua is a non-model plant with limited genomic information available, and sequencing of limited number of randomly selected cDNA clones often have insufficient coverage of less abundant transcripts, including important regulatory transcription factors (TFs). In addition, genes uniquely or preferentially expressed in trichomes may be under-represented in non-tissue-targeted EST sequencing projects. A comprehensive survey of genes expressed in glandular trichome will facilitate new gene discovery and contribute significantly to elucidating the terpenoid pathway regulation and trichome function in A. annua."
TA038182_I_0002,"High-throughput 454 pyrosequencing was used to deeply sequence the A. annua glandular trichome transcriptome, enabling de novo assembly and functional annotation of genes, including those involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis, and validating their expression via RT-PCR.","Whole genome or transcriptome sequencing enables functional genomic studies based on global gene expression. The newly developed high throughput pyrosequencing technology allows rapid production of sequence data with dramatically reduced time, labor, and cost. So far, most applications of pyrosequencing have involved analysis of genomic DNA. Published reports on 454 pyrosequencing of transcriptomes have been mostly restricted to model species with genomic or comprehensive Sanger EST data available. Previous studies using genome or Sanger EST sequences for mapping and annotation of 454 ESTs were not able to accomplish de novo assembly of their 454 ESTs. We here present the global transcriptome characterization of A. annua glandular trichome, the so called biofactory for the production of artemisinin and other plant secondary metabolites. We assigned putative function to 28,573 unigenes, including previously undescribed enzymes likely involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. We verified the expression of 32 selected unigenes and novel transcripts in glandular trichomes using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. These 454 ESTs were linked to metabolic process specific in glandular trichomes and form the basis for further investigation."
TA038182_M_0001,"The study began with the cultivation of Artemisia annua plants from seeds, which were grown under natural light conditions in a greenhouse. Glandular trichomes were isolated from flower buds using glass beads and a cell disrupter, followed by filtration through nylon sieves to ensure purity. Total RNA was extracted from these trichomes, and cDNA was synthesized using a commercial kit. The cDNA was normalized to reduce the abundance of highly expressed transcripts before being subjected to pyrosequencing. The resulting sequences were cleaned, assembled, and compared against protein databases to assign putative functions.","A. annua seeds were purchased from Youyang, Sichuang province of China. Seeds were sown into commercial potting mixture for germination. The germinated plantlets were grown under natural light conditions in the greenhouse located at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Flower buds were collected for trichome isolation before flowering. Trichome cells were gently abraded from the surface of flower buds using glass beads and a commercial cell disrupter (BioSpec Products). The isolated secretary cells were separated from other cells and tissue fragments in the mixture by sequentially passing through a 40 μm and a 30 μm nylon sieves. Glandular cells were finally collected in 30 μm meshes with minimum contamination of non-glandular trichomes. Total RNA was extracted from glandular trichomes isolated from 30 g flower buds following the standard protocol of RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using the BD SMARTM PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with oligo(dT) primer as described in the provided protocol using 500 ng total RNA. Double-strand cDNA was prepared from 2 μl of the first-strand reaction by PCR with provided primers in a 100 μL reaction. cDNA was purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification spin columns. Normalization was performed using TRIMMER cDNA normalization kit (EVR_GEN) to decrease the prevalence of abundant transcripts before sequencing. Approximately 1 μg of normalized double stranded cDNA was used for 454 pyrosequencing. Approximately 1 μg of the adaptor-ligated cDNA population was sheared by nebulization and DNA sequencing was performed following protocols for the Genome Sequencer GS FLX System (Roche Diagnostic). Reads generated by the FLX sequencer were trimmed of low quality, low complexity [poly(A)] and adaptor sequences using the SeqClean software. The cleaned sequences were subject to CAP3 program for clustering and assembly using default parameters. After assembly, the resulting contigs and singlets were aligned with NCBI non-redundant protein database using blast2go software with a cut-off e-value of 1e-10. The GI accessions of best hits were retrieved, and the GO accessions were mapped to GO terms according to molecular function, biological process and cellular component ontologies."
TA038182_M_0002,"To validate the presence of transcripts identified through pyrosequencing, 35 unigenes and novel transcripts were selected for RT-PCR analysis. RNA was extracted from glandular trichomes, non-glandular trichomes, leaves, and hairy roots, and cDNA was synthesized. PCR amplification was performed under optimized conditions to ensure exponential phase amplification. Actin was used as a loading control, and expression was confirmed in multiple independent reactions.","To verify the presence of pyrosequencing ESTs in glandular trichomes, we totally selected 35 unigenes and novel transcripts for RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA were extracted from glandular trichomes, non-glandular hairy trichomes, leaves and hairy roots respectively. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 10 μL (about 1 μg) total RNA using SuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with Oligo(dT)12-18 Primer. PCR was performed using 0.5 to 2 μL of the cDNA in a total of 50 μL reaction volume. The PCR conditions were 2 min at 95°C, 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 47-56°C, 1 min at 72°C for 30 cycles, followed by 5 min at 72°C. These conditions were chosen because none of the samples analyzed reached a plateau at the end of the amplification (i.e. they were at the exponential phase of the amplification). Actin was used as a loading control, and loading was estimated by staining the gel with ethidium bromide. Expression analysis of each gene was confirmed in at least 2 independent RT-reactions using forward and reverse primers."
TA038182_R_0001,"The study presents a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of Artemisia annua glandular trichomes using 454 pyrosequencing. A total of 406,044 ESTs were generated, assembled into 42,678 contigs and 147,699 singletons, with 29,577 unigenes assigned putative functions via BLAST searches. The data reveals extensive metabolic activity, including terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways, and highlights the MEP pathway's dominance in DMAPP/IPP production. Comparative analysis with other plant species and RT-PCR validation confirm the reliability of the findings.","Title: Global characterization of Artemisia annua glandular trichome transcriptome using 454 pyrosequencing. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Glandular trichomes produce a wide variety of commercially important secondary metabolites in many plant species. The most prominent anti-malarial drug artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone, is produced in glandular trichomes of Artemisia annua. However, only limited genomic information is currently available in this non-model plant species. RESULTS: We present a global characterization of A. annua glandular trichome transcriptome using 454 pyrosequencing. Sequencing runs using two normalized cDNA collections from glandular trichomes yielded 406,044 expressed sequence tags (average length = 210 nucleotides), which assembled into 42,678 contigs and 147,699 singletons. Performing a second sequencing run only increased the number of genes identified by approximately 30%, indicating that massively parallel pyrosequencing provides deep coverage of the A. annua trichome transcriptome. By BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant protein database, putative functions were assigned to over 28,573 unigenes, including previously undescribed enzymes likely involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Comparison with ESTs derived from trichome collections of other plant species revealed expressed genes in common functional categories across different plant species. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of selected unigenes and novel transcripts in A. annua glandular trichomes. CONCLUSION: The presence of contigs corresponding to enzymes for terpenoids and flavonoids biosynthesis suggests important metabolic activity in A. annua glandular trichomes. Our comprehensive survey of genes expressed in glandular trichome will facilitate new gene discovery and shed light on the regulatory mechanism of artemisinin metabolism and trichome function in A. annua."
TA038182_R_0002,"The pyrosequencing results yielded 386,881 high-quality reads, assembled into contigs and singletons with an average length of 334 bp and 191 bp, respectively. BLAST analysis assigned functions to 29,577 unigenes, while 84.5% remained novel. Gene Ontology classification highlighted metabolic processes, transport, and transcriptional control as dominant functions. Comparative analysis with TrichomeDB revealed 9% homology, indicating extensive novel transcript discovery. The MEP pathway was more abundant than the MVA pathway, suggesting its primary role in DMAPP/IPP production. RT-PCR validated the expression of selected transcripts, including those in non-glandular trichomes.","Result: Totally 406,044 ESTs (minimal size > 50 bp) averaging 210 bp were generated from two consecutive pyrosequencing runs. Cleaning (removal of primer, polyA tail, etc.) of the raw sequences resulted in a total of 386,881 high quality reads with an average length of 205 nucleotides totalling 85 Mb. After clustering and assembly using TGICL CAP3 clustering tools, these reads were assembled into 42,678 contigs and 147,699 singletons. The average length for contigs and singletons are 334 bp and 191 bp respectively. The contigs and singletons are collectively referred to as unigenes. The length distribution of unigenes and their component reads are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. The contigs were searched against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein database using the blastx algorithm. Among the 190,377 contigs and singletons, 29,577(15.5%) had at least one significant alignment to existing gene model in blastx searches (E-value cutoff, e-10) (see Additional file 1). A majority (84.5%) of the pyrosequencing assemblies did not match any known sequences in the existing database and thus likely represent novel (E-value cutoff, pts sion of 17 transcripts identified in this study. Performing a second sequencing run increased the number of genes identified by approximately 30% (Table 3), suggesting that two pyrosequencing runs detect a substantial fraction of genes expressed in glandular trichomes and provide deep coverage of the A. annua trichome transcriptome. The 357,843 sequences that had matches with protein sequences in the NCBI protein database could be condensed into 29,577 clusters based on their top protein hits. Each 454 contig was assigned a putative gene description and a GO classification based on the 'best hit' blastx search (bitscore > 45, e-value < 1-10), using the 'inferred from sequence similarity' (ISS) level of evidence. The unigenes were classified into three major functional categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, according to the standard Gene Ontology terms (GO; ). The assigned functionality of genes covers a broad range of GO categories. The top 20 most highly represented GO categories are illustrated in Figure 1. Under the category of biological process, transport, transcriptional control, and metabolic process were among the most highly represented categories, indicating the important metabolic activities in A. annua glandular trichomes. Other categories include photosynthesis, secondary metabolism (lignin, flavonoid, and isoprenoid biosynthesis process) and primary metabolism (fatty acid, glycolysis, carbohydrate process etc.). TrichOME is a publicly available database of genes and metabolites expressed in plant trichomes. It currently contains 37,017 conventional ESTs derived from 8 plant species, including Medicago sativa, Humulus lupulus, Mentha × piperita, Nicotiana benthamiana, Ocimum basilicum, Solanum habrochaites, Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum pennellii. A tblastx search against TrichomeDB showed that only 17,372(9%) of our 454 contigs had best blast hits (e-value < 1e-10) to 8,095 EST clusters with unique descriptions. Thus 454 sequencing has revealed many transcripts not previously detected in A. annua. ESTs homologous to photosynthesis-related proteins (chlorophyll a/b binding protein, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit) are among the top 10 most highly expressed transcripts. The top ranked common molecular function of ESTs identified from all 9 plant species are listed in Table 4. Regulation of metabolic process, metabolic process, oxidation reduction, and transport categories has the highest number of contigs. Trichomes are known to be active in photosynthesis, as well as for their roles in storage and secretion of toxic compounds e.g. heavy metals, which requires the function of transporters. In our assembled pyrosequencing EST collections, we identified a large number of contigs homologous to ABC transporter, which is one of the most important families of membrane transport proteins that may play critical roles in the transmembrane transport of secondary metabolites in plants. The large amount of transporters can be linked to the secretion and transport function of glandular trichomes. Numerous sesquiterpene and monoterpene compounds have been identified in A. annua leaves, stems and isolated glandular trichomes. The genes corresponding to enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of major sesquiterpenes have been cloned and characterized. To investigate the trichome function in secondary metabolism, the annotated unigenes were searched for enzymes participate in terpenoids biosynthesis. As shown in Additional file 2, unigenes corresponding to all the known enzymes in the terpenoids MEP and MVA pathway were identified. In higher plants, terpenoids precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) can be produced from both MVA and MEP routes, which is then converted to its isomer DMAPP (Figure 2). The cytosolic MVA terpenoids pathway, which starts from acetyl-CoA and proceeds through the intermediate mevalonate (MVA), provides the precursors for sterols and ubiquinone. The plastidial MEP pathway, which involves a condensation of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, is used for the synthesis of isoprene, carotenoids, abscisic acid, and the side chains of chlorophylls and plastoquinone. Although the subcellular compartmentation allows both pathways to operate independently, there is ample evidence that cross-talk exist between these two pathways. Unigenes encoding the MEP and MVA pathway enzymes and all the sesquiterpene artemisinin pathway enzymes were present in our pyrosequencing collection. It is noteworthy that although the sequences were derived from normalized cDNA collections, unigenes corresponding to MEP pathway enzymes were two fold more abundant as compared with MVA pathway transcripts. This likely suggests that the MEP pathway may serve as a major route for DMAPP/IPP production in the A. annua trichomes. The MEP pathway has previously been shown to provide precursors for both mono-and sesqui-terpene biosynthesis in snapdragon flowers. In a recent report on hops, the ESTs encoding MEP pathway enzymes are also found more abundant than those of MVA pathways. Except for those well characterized terpenoid pathway genes, other unigenes annotated as sesquiterpene synthase and monoterpene synthase were identified. Three unigenes (Contig02039, Contig16267, Contig14765) annotated as sesquiterpine synthases were selected for RACE PCR to retrieve the full length cDNAs. Sequence analysis indicated that the conserved sesquiterpene synthase functional domain exists in all three genes (Figure 3). Further functional characterization of these enzymes will be reported elsewhere. Furthermore, large amount of unigenes annotated as phenylpropanoids and flavanoids pathway enzymes were present in the assemebled pyrosequencing EST collection (ss Additional file 3), indicating the metabolic function of glandular trichomes in A. annua secondary metabolism."
TA038182_R_0003,"RT-PCR validation confirmed the expression of 17 selected contigs in glandular trichomes, with some also detected in non-glandular trichomes, leaves, and roots. A contig exclusive to glandular trichomes and roots was identified. Additionally, 13 out of 18 novel transcripts and singletons were validated, demonstrating the reliability of the pyrosequencing data. These findings underscore the utility of deep sequencing for uncovering rare transcripts and tissue-specific gene expression.","A set of 17 contigs were selected for semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis to confirm their expression (Figure 4A). The selected contigs encode enzymes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis, and putative transcription factors. PCR experiments were conducted on four pools of cDNAs derived from (1) glandular trichomes, (2) non-glandular trichomes (3) leaves, and (4) roots. The results demonstrate that all of the novel transcripts detected among the 454-ESTs are indeed expressed in glandular trichomes, including those with low expression levels. This suggests that deep pyrosequencing is effective in revealing the expression of many rare transcripts, e.g. transcription factors. Most of the tested contigs were also expressed in leaf and non glandular trichome cDNA pools, except for one contig40477, which was only expressed in glandular trichomes and roots. Interestingly, three contigs likely encode enzymes needed in sesquiterpene biosynthesis were also strongly expressed in non-glandular type of trichomes. This raises the question as to whether glandular trichome is the sole site for the biosynthesis of artemisinin and other sesquiterpenes in A. annua. RT-PCR was also used to confirm the expression of novel transcripts and singletons. A set of 18 novel transcripts and singletons was randomly selected to test if they are indeed expressed in GT (Figure 4B). Of the 20 primer pairs, 13 produced RT-PCR products that were of the correct size and whose sequence matched the sequences from which the primers were designed. Based on these results, we conclude that many of the novel transcripts and singletons detected among the 454-ESTs are not due to the sequencing artifacts. This result provides further evidence for the value of tissue specific 454 sequencing for gene discovery."

TA038182_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the significance of A. annua as the sole source of artemisinin and the challenges posed by the lack of genomic resources for non-model plants. The study's use of 454 pyrosequencing enabled the recovery of a substantial portion of the glandular trichome transcriptome, revealing novel transcripts and expanding hypotheses about trichome metabolic functions. Approximately 85% of the pyrosequencing assemblies did not align with existing ESTs in GenBank, possibly due to the specialized nature of the sampled cell type or the complexity of the A. annua genome. The study prioritized gene discovery by using normalized cDNA to reduce oversampling of abundant transcripts. While the average contig length was short (~334 bp) and only 62% of reads assembled into contigs, the approach identified low-abundance transcripts often missed by conventional EST projects. Pyrosequencing offers rapid transcriptome characterization for non-model species but requires RACE PCR for full-length gene sequences. Comparative analysis with trichome ESTs from other plants suggested common functions across trichome types, with some sesquiterpene biosynthesis enzymes highly expressed in both glandular and non-glandular trichomes. The study underscores the need for further investigation into the roles of non-glandular trichomes in artemisinin biosynthesis.","Discussion: As the sole plant source for artemisinin production, the A. annua has been studied extensively for the past decades. Like most other non-model plant species, it has lacked genetic and genomic resources necessary for mechanistic study. Although a precise estimate of transcriptome coverage is unattainable without full genomic sequence, we appear to have recovered a significantly portion of the A. annua glandular trichome transcriptome. Novel transcripts detected highlights the hypothesis-expanding aspects of 454 deep pyrosequencing approach, which potentially facilitate the understanding of glandular trichome metabolic function. The assembled sequence data also provided a rich source of information for further investigation. Two consecutive pyrosequencing runs identified a large number of genes expressed in glandular trichomes. In data analysis, approximately 85% of the pyrosequencing assemblies did not align to any ESTs available in GenBank. This high proportion could reflect the specialized cell type that was sampled or perhaps the greater complexity of the A. annua genome. Because our priority goal in this study is gene discovery, we therefore chose normalized cDNA population to reduce oversampling of abundant transcripts and to maximize coverage of less abundant transcripts present in the sample. The average contig length was fairly short (~334 bp), and only 62% of the sequence reads assembled into contigs, leaving 147,699 singletons. Genes involved in plant secondary metabolism have frequently been identified by EST approach. The lower cost and greater sequence coverage offered by pyrosequencing makes it possible to identify more candidate genes involved in plant natural product biosynthetic pathways, esp. those with low abundance and often missed by conventional EST projects. For non-model species with little or no genomic data available, such as A. annua, pyrosequencing offers rapid characterization of a large portion of the transcriptome and therefore provides a comprehensive tool for gene discovery. However, one limitation of pyrosequencing is that one must rely on RACE PCR in order to obtain full-length sequence data for a given gene of interest. Comparison between our glandular trichome 454 ESTs with conventional ESTs generated from trichomes of other plant species revealed likely common function in non-glandular and glandular trichomes. In addition, some unigenes corresponding to enzymes in sesquiterpene biosynthesis were found to be highly expressed in both trichome types in our RT-PCR analysis. Although it has been suggested that glandular trichomes are the site for synthesis and accumulation of plant secondary metabolites, it will be interesting to further investigate the different functional roles of non-glandular trichomes in artemisinin biosynthesis."

TA043628_I_0001,"The introduction outlines the global burden of schistosomiasis, the limitations of current treatments like praziquantel, and the need for alternative therapies, particularly natural products, to target different life stages of Schistosoma mansoni.","Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the blood-dwelling fluke Schistosoma. Human schistosomiasis is the second most devastating tropical disease after malaria and remains a major public health problem. The World Health Organization estimated that 236 million people in the tropics and subtropics required preventive treatment in 2019, and 90% resided in Africa. Schistosomiasis is endemic in 78 countries, causing roughly 70 million disability-adjusted life years. Schistosoma infection is also associated with high morbidity in human populations worldwide, with about 280,000 annual deaths related to its parasitism and complications. Schistosoma mansoni, the most widespread species, causes a yearly infection of 54 million people, and 393 million are at risk of getting infected in sub-Saharan Africa. Infection occurs when free-swimming larvae, cercariae, released by various snail intermediate hosts penetrate the human host's skin while in contact with contaminated freshwater.There is no effective vaccine, and the main strategy for schistosomiasis control relies on mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel (PZQ). Although PZQ is effective against adult forms of all schistosome species, it is inefficient against larval and juvenile worms and, therefore, unable to prevent reinfection and stop parasite transmission. In addition, repeated rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with PZQ have led to therapeutic failures in disease-endemic areas, raising the possibility of drug resistance. Indeed, Schistosoma isolates with reduced susceptibility to PZQ have already been identified, leading to concerns regarding treatment-resistant parasites. Hence, there is a rising need for new therapeutic alternatives. Therefore, searching for bioactive natural products against Schistosoma is essential for establishing future strategies to control schistosomiasis. In addition to treating infected individuals, interrupting people's contact with the infectious larvae cercariae could help avoid infection."
TA043628_I_0002,"The introduction highlights the potential of medicinal plants like Pedilanthus tithymaloides, traditionally used to treat schistosomiasis, and describes the study's aim to evaluate its extracts' activity against Schistosoma mansoni cercariae and adult worms.","In this regard, several in vitro studies have already been performed to search for new active compounds from medicinal plants against different stages of S. mansoni, and promising results have been reported. Pedilanthus tithymaloides (Linn) Poit., also known as Euphorbia tithymaloides, is a common succulent shrub native to tropical and subtropical America belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. The plant is actively used in India, Brazil, and Madagascar. Literature reported a wide range of healing properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, wound healing activity, larvicidal, antimalarial and antituberculous, anthelmintic, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antidiabetic. The plant is widespread as ornamental in Cameroon's Littoral, Centre, East, Adamawa, and North regions. Some communities of the Littoral region mix the stem bark of this plant with raffia wine, boil the mixture, and drink it to treat schistosomiasis. Even though its biological potential has been proved against several microorganisms, the biological activity of P. tithymaloides against the life stages of S. mansoni has not yet been assessed. This study was carried out to evaluate the in vitro activities of the raffia wine extract and the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark on cercariae and adult worms of S. mansoni and to establish the extracts' cytotoxicity and phytochemical profiles."
TA043628_M_0001,"The study began with the collection of Pedilanthus tithymaloides stem barks in Cameroon, followed by botanical identification at the National Herbarium. Two extraction methods were employed: raffia wine extraction, where barks were boiled in fresh raffia wine and concentrated under reduced pressure, and hydroethanolic extraction, where dried and powdered barks were refluxed in 20% ethanol. Both extracts were then lyophilized to obtain the final products.","Pedilanthus tithymaloides (Linn) Poit. was harvested in May 2015 in the locality of Loum in the Littoral region of Cameroon. Botanical identification of a plant sample was performed at the 'National Herbarium' of Yaounde, Cameroon, and a voucher specimen number 25714/SRF/Cam was deposited. After plant collection, the raffia wine extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark was prepared as described by the traditional healer. First, barks (1500 g) were removed from the stems, cleaned, and boiled in fresh raffia wine (5 L). Next, the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (BÜCHI B-480), frozen, and then lyophilized to give the wine extract (RwPt) with an extraction yield of 2.64% w/w. For hydroethanolic extraction, the stem bark of P. tithymaloides was dried and powdered. Afterward, the powder (100 g) was boiled in 20% ethanol (1 L) for 2 h using a reflux design. Next, the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (BÜCHI B-480), frozen, and then lyophilized to obtain the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark (HePt) with an extraction yield of 11.18% w/w."
TA043628_M_0002,"The study adhered to ethical guidelines for animal use, with approval from the Animal Ethical Committee. Cercaricidal activity was assessed using S. mansoni cercariae obtained from infected snails. The extracts were tested at various concentrations in a microtiter plate assay, with viability monitored over 180 minutes. LC50 values were determined using nonlinear regression, and minimal lethal and effective concentrations were recorded.","All experiments in this study followed the principles of laboratory animals' use and care of the 'European Community' guidelines (EEC Directive 2010/63/EEC). The protocol for experimental design was approved by the 'Animal Ethical Committee' of the Laboratory of Animal Physiology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon. Raffia wine and hydroethanolic extracts of P. tithymaloides stem bark were tested for cercaricidal activity following the procedure previously described by some authors. S. mansoni cercariae were obtained by photostimulation of experimentally infected Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails. Briefly, 20 to 25 cercariae-shed snails were pooled into a glass beaker containing 20 mL of distilled water and exposed to artificial light for 2 hours. Snails were removed from the beaker, and the cercarial suspension was used for the assays. An average of 20 freshly shed cercariae were counted in 100 μL of the suspension and transferred into each well of a 24 microtiter well plate under an inverted microscope (Olympus C.K. 2). The raffia wine or hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark was dissolved in distilled water, and a stock solution of 2000 μg/mL was obtained. Then, concentrations of 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 μg/mL were prepared by serial dilutions of the stock solution. Finally, each concentration was added to each well containing 20 cercariae for a final volume of 1 mL. Distilled water was set up as a control, and niclosamide-olamine 5% (1 g/mL) (Jiangsu Aijin Agrochemical Co., Ltd, China) as a pharmacological control. Each concentration was assayed in quadruplicates, and the experiments were replicated. The cercariae's viability assessment was performed for 180 minutes at 30 minutes intervals using an inverted microscope (Olympus C.K. 2). Cercariae were considered dead when they stopped movement and sank down, and their tail was detached. The LC50 value of P. tithymaloides raffia wine or hydroethanolic extract on S. mansoni cercariae was determined at different time points by interpolation from the 'restricted cubic spline curve' (nonlinear regression). The minimal lethal concentration (MLC) (minimum concentration needed to kill all cercariae) and the minimal effective concentration (MEC) (minimum concentration required to observe any change in viability or morphology of cercariae) were determined after 180 minutes."
TA043628_M_0003,"Adult S. mansoni worms were collected from infected mice using a perfusion technique and incubated in culture plates with the extracts. Motor activity and viability were monitored over 48 hours, with LC50 values calculated using the Trimmed Spearman-Karber method. The study also included cytotoxicity testing on a liver cell line using the WST-8 assay, with selectivity indices calculated to compare toxicity to parasites and mammalian cells.","Balb/c mice weighing 20–25 g were infected with 130 cercariae of S. mansoni released from experimentally infected B. pfeifferi by the tail and leg immersion technique. After 49 days, adult worms were recovered from mice's mesenteric veins and liver by perfusion with a sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl). Freshly harvested worms were washed three times in a Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium (GMEM) (Sigma, St Louis, USA) supplemented with an antibiotic-antimycotic solution (10,000 U/mL penicillin, 10,000 μg/mL streptomycin, and 25 μg/mL amphotericin B) (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, USA) and gentamicin (40 μg/mL). The bioassay followed the standard operating procedures that recommended at least five female and five male worms per well. Therefore, 10 adult worms of both sexes were transferred to each well of a 24-well culture plate with 1900 μL of complete GMEM, pH 7.5 (GMEM with 20 mM of HEPES, 40 μg/mL gentamicin, 50 μg/mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 μg/mL neomycin, 2 mM of L-glutamine, and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum). The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 to allow acclimatization. After acclimatization of worms, the raffia wine extract (RwPt) or the hydroethanolic extract (HePt) of P. tithymaloïdes stem bark was dissolved in distilled water, passed through a 0.2 μm sterile syringe filter, and added to each well for final concentrations of 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 μg/mL in a final volume of 2 mL. Worms incubated in GMEM alone or praziquantel (10 μg/mL) were used as negative or positive controls, respectively. Each concentration was tested in quadruplicates, and the experiments were repeated. Worms were incubated for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2, and monitored every 24 h to evaluate their motor activity and viability under an inverted microscope (Olympus C.K. 2). Viability was determined based on the standard operating procedures for screening schistosomicidal compounds described previously ((+ + +) indicates normal activity; (+ +) slight loss of movement with active tail, suckers, and gynecophoric canal membrane; (+) movement of tails and suckers alone; and (−) no movement). Worms showing no sign of motility for 1 minute, associated with worm deformities such as blackening, twisting, and contracting, were considered dead. The median lethal concentration (LC50) was calculated using the Trimmed Spearman–Karber (TSK) method, version 1.5 software downloaded from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The cytotoxicity analysis of the raffia wine and hydroethanolic extracts of P. tithymaloides was assessed using a C57/L melanoma liver cell line (Hepa 1–6 ATCC CRL-1830) based on the WST-8 assay. Cells were cultured in a high-glucose Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) with pyruvate and L-glutamine (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Serana, Australia) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA). The cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. Monolayer cultures reaching a confluence between 80 and 90% were detached using trypsin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and calibrated with a cell counter (Fast Read 102). The calibrated cell suspension was seeded into 96-well plates at 1 × 104 cells per well and incubated overnight for cell adhesion. Afterward, the medium was replaced with a fresh one, and cells were exposed to different concentrations (15.625, 31.25, 62.50, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 μg/mL) of the extracts for 24 hours. Cells incubated in DMEM alone served as controls. Each concentration was tested in duplicates, and the experiment was repeated three times. Cells viability was measured by their mitochondrial activity in reducing 2-(2-methoxy-4- nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2, 4- disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt to formazan using the Cell Counting kit-8 (WST-8, Abcam, ab228554, U.K.), according to the manufacturer instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Dynex MRX TC II microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, USA). Results were expressed as the percentage of cell growth, and the concentration of each extract required to inhibit cell growth by 50% (IC50) was calculated. The degree of selectivity of each extract was measured as the ratio between the IC50 obtained for the cell line and the LC50 for S. mansoni cercariae or adult worms. Selectivity index = [IC50 of extract in cell line (μg/mL)]/[LC50 of the same extract in S. mansoni cercariae (μg/mL)]."
TA043628_M_0004,"The hydroethanolic extract was analyzed using LC-MS to identify bioactive compounds. Two diterpenoids were annotated, and their structures were drawn using Chemdraw. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism, with statistical significance determined by ANOVA and Tukey's test.","The LC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 1200 Series liquid chromatography system coupled to an Agilent accurate QTOF 6520 mass spectrometer (GenTech Scientific, USA). Compounds were separated at room temperature on a Zorbax SB-C18 (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm; Agilent Technologies, USA). The sample (1 mg/mL) was prepared in an HPLC-grade ACN followed by filtration through a Millipore filter (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, France) and the injection volume was 0.8 μL. The mobile phase was constituted of acetonitrile (containing 0.05% formic acid) and water (containing 0.05% formic acid). The method was as follows: 98% of ACN for 0.1 min, then 0% ACN for 8 min, followed by 0% ACN for 12.5 min, and then 98% of ACN for 25 min. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min, and UV detection was set at 210 nm. For mass spectra acquisition, an Agilent accurate QTOF 6520 mass spectrometer with an electrospray interface in the positive mode (ESI+), temperature 340°C, and an ion spray of 4000 V was used. Sample cone voltage was set at 120 V, and mass spectra were recorded in the range m/z 50–2000. Nitrogen was used as nebulizer gas, and the nebulizer pressure was set at 30 psi. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with MassHunter Workstation software (Version B.04.00). The annotated compounds were drawn using Chemdraw Professional 15.0 (PerkinElmer informatics Inc., USA). Data analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.02 software (San Diego, CA, USA). All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Significant differences between mean values were determined by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for cercaricidal activity and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for schistosomicidal activity, followed by the Tukey multiple-comparison test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant."

The raffia wine extract (RwPt) was less effective. Both extracts exhibited low cytotoxicity, with HePt showing higher selectivity. LC-MS analysis identified two diterpenoids in HePt, suggesting potential bioactive compounds.","Schistosomiasis control remains a public health concern, and there is a need to evaluate new strategies for targeting larval and adult stages of the parasite. As Pedilanthus tithymaloides is empirically used to treat schistosomiasis, it becomes essential to know its effective action scientifically. This study assessed the cercaricidal and schistosomicidal activity of P. tithymaloides stem barks raffia wine extract (RwPt) and hydroethanolic extract (HePt). Different concentrations of these extracts were tested against cercariae (31.25-1000 µg/mL) and adult worms (62.5-2000 µg/mL) of Schistosoma mansoni. Niclosamide-olamine 5% (1 µg/mL) and praziquantel (10 µg/mL) were used as pharmacological controls. Cercariae viability was determined every 30 min for 180 min, and adult worms' motor activity and viability after 24 and 48 h incubation. In addition, cytotoxicity and phytochemical analysis were performed. HePt was lethal to cercariae and adult worms with LC50 of 73.91 µg/mL after 60 min of incubation and 731.17 µg/mL after 48 h of incubation, respectively. Furthermore, a significant reduction of 94.44% in motor activity was observed in surviving worms at the concentration of 2000 µg/mL. RwPt was less effective on S. mansoni cercariae with an LC50 of 617.86 µg/mL after 180 min and on adult worms with a mortality rate of 9.83% at 2000 µg/mL for 48 h incubation. Both extracts showed a weak cytotoxicity profile with an IC50 of 983.50 µg/mL for HePt and more than 1000 µg/mL for RwPt. The LC-MS analysis of HePt allowed the detection of two annotated diterpenoids. Based on the selectivity index, the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem barks disclosed an intense cercaricidal activity and a moderate schistosomicidal effect with low cytotoxicity.

TA043628_R_0002,"The cercaricidal effects of P. tithymaloides extracts were time- and dose-dependent. RwPt showed minimal efficacy, with significant cercariae mortality only at high concentrations (250-1000 µg/mL) after prolonged incubation (180 min). In contrast, HePt demonstrated rapid and potent cercaricidal activity, killing all cercariae within 60 min at concentrations ≥125 µg/mL. LC50 values for HePt decreased over time, reaching 19.26 µg/mL at 180 min, while RwPt's LC50 was 617.86 µg/mL. The study highlights HePt's superior cercaricidal potency compared to RwPt.","Different extracts of Pedilanthus tithymaloides stem bark showed varying cercaricidal potency against S. mansoni cercariae (Figure 1). Effects of different concentrations of P. tithymaloides raffia wine extract (RwPt) on the viability of S. mansoni cercariae after incubation for up to 180 min are depicted in Figure 1(a). Following incubation with RwPt, a time- and dose-dependent decrease in the viability of cercariae was recorded. The reduction was insignificant for concentrations ranging from 31.25 to 125 µg/mL. A significant decrease in cercariae viability was recorded only for concentrations from 250 to 1000 µg/µL. Still, it was less relevant than that of niclosamide-olamine 5% at the same time point (∗∗∗p < 0.001). Thus, cercariae incubated with 250 and 500 µg/mL of RwPt showed the highest mortality rate of 18.93% (p < 0.001) and 34.27% (p < 0.001), respectively, at 180 min. At the highest concentration of 1000 µg/mL, a slight reduction in cercariae viability appears within 60 min of incubation (16.45%), rising to 36.72% after 90 min, and became significant (p < 0.001) after 150 min (90.92%) and 180 min (100%). Cercariae remained viable for up to 180 min in the control group (Figure 1(a)). The minimal effective concentration (MEC) and the minimal lethal concentration (MLC) of the raffia wine extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark were 250 and 1000 µg/mL, respectively, after 180 min of incubation (Table 1). The exposure of cercariae to P. tithymaloides hydroethanolic extract (HePt) for 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min showed a time- and dose-dependent decrease in cercariae viability (Figure 1(b)). Within 60 min of incubation, all cercariae were dead at concentrations ranging from 125 to 1000 µg/mL (p < 0.001), and there was no statistical difference with the reference drug niclosamide-olamine 5%. At 31.25 and 62.5 µg/mL, a 14% cercariae mortality rate was recorded as compared to controls wells (p < 0.05). It was, however, less significant than the 100% mortality rate of niclosamide-olamine. After 150 min incubation, mortality rates of 93.60% and 100% were reached at 31.25 µg/mL and 62.5 µg/mL, respectively (p < 0.001). Cercariae remained viable for up to 180 min in the control group (Figure 1(b)). The minimal effective concentration (MEC) of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark was 31.25 µg/mL after 150 min of incubation, and the minimal lethal concentration (MLC) was 62.5 µg/mL at the same time point (Table 1). The median lethal concentration (LC50) of P. tithymaloides extracts was determined at each time point (Table 1). The LC50 of the raffia wine extract (RwPt) could only be calculated at 150 min and 180 min incubation. The LC50 values of the hydroethanolic extract (HePt) decreased time dependently from 60 to 150 min of incubation. At 180 min time point, the LC50 of RwPt was 617.86 ± 34.65 µg/mL, and that of HePt was 19.26 ± 1.22 µg/mL (Table 1). The hydroethanolic extract (HePt) showed more pronounced cercaricidal potency than the raffia wine extract (RwPt)."
TA043628_R_0003,"The schistosomicidal activity of P. tithymaloides extracts was assessed on adult S. mansoni worms. RwPt had negligible effects, with only 9.83% mortality at 2000 µg/mL after 48 h. HePt exhibited time- and concentration-dependent lethality, achieving 86.47% mortality at 2000 µg/mL after 48 h, with male worms being more susceptible. Praziquantel (control) killed worms within 24 h. Cytotoxicity tests revealed low toxicity for both extracts (IC50 > 1000 µg/mL for RwPt, 983.50 µg/mL for HePt). The selectivity index favored HePt for cercaricidal (SI = 51.06) and schistosomicidal (SI = 1.34) activities. LC-MS identified two diterpenoids in HePt, potentially responsible for its bioactivity.","The schistosomicidal activity of different extracts of P. tithymaloides stem bark was assessed by microscopic observation of S. mansoni adult worms incubated at different concentrations (62.5–2000 µg/mL) to check their motor activity and to determine the mortality rate using a viability scale. Results are shown in Table 2. Control worms incubated only in the culture medium remained viable up to 48 h even though some displayed weak motor activity reduction. Incubation of adult S. mansoni worms with RwPt did not result in any worms' death at all concentrations after 24 h. Only a low mortality rate of 9.83% and 18.07% reduction of worms' motor activity were recorded at the highest concentration of 2000 µg/mL after 48 h of incubation. The LC50 of RwPt was then greater than 2000 µg/mL (Table 2). The minimal motor activity was marked by the absence of worm motility apart from gut movements, weak movement of the suckers, and occasional waves of the body. Following exposure of adult worms to HePt, the mortality rate increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. After 24 h of incubation, mortality rates of 10.98% and 25.60% were recorded at 1000 and 2000 µg/mL, respectively. They were associated with reduced motility of surviving worms by 19.08% and 26.54%. After 48 h incubation, the mortality rates increased to 66.34% and 86.47% (p < 0.001) at 1000 and 2000 µg/mL, respectively. At the same time, motor activity declined by 82.54% and 94.44%, respectively (Table 2). The concentration of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark necessary to kill 50% of worms (LC50) was 731.17 µg/mL (365.74–1047.43 µg/mL) after 48 h incubation. Although HePt exhibited a lethal action on male and female worms, male worms seemed more sensitive than females. At the highest concentration of 2000 µg/mL, 95.15% of male worms were killed against 78.33% of females (Table 2). In the pharmacological control group incubated with 10 µg/mL of praziquantel, parasite death was observed within 24 h post-incubation. After 24 h incubation of mouse hepatic melanoma cells (Hepa 1–6 cells) with different concentrations (15.625 to 1000 µg/mL) of raffia wine (RwPt) or hydroethanolic extract (HePt) of P. tithymaloides stem bark, the inhibition rate on cell proliferation increased in a concentration-dependent manner. It reached 32.27% and 50.17% for RwPt and HePt, respectively, at the highest 1000 µg/mL concentration. Based on their inhibitory activity, the IC50 of RwPt was more than 1000 µg/mL, and that of HePt was 983.50 ± 7.75 µg/mL (Table 3). The selectivity index (SI) was calculated based on plant extracts' anthelmintic activity and cytotoxicity profile. The selectivity index of HePt was 13.31 at 60 min and 51.06 at 150 min time points for the cercaricidal activity and 1.34 for the schistosomicidal activity. However, the IC50 of RwPt was more than 1000 µg/mL, and its LC50 was more than 2000 µg/mL for the schistosomicidal effect. Therefore, its selectivity index will be greater than 1.50 for cercaricidal activity and less than 1 for schistosomicidal activity (Table 3). Analysis of the LC-MS chromatogram of the hydroethanolic extract from the stem bark of P. tithymaloides and comparison of the observed MS data with reported literature data on previously isolated compounds from the genus Pedilanthus and also with MS data of natural compounds listed in the Dictionary of Natural Products (https://dnp.chenetbase.com) revealed the possible presence of jatrophane diterpenes. The HPLC-MS showed two significant peaks with retention times (Rt) at 7.675 and 7.963 min (Figure 2(a)). The peak at Rt = 7.675 min corresponding to the molecular ion [M+Na]+ detected at m/z 739.2914 (Figure 2(b)) was annotated to the jatrophane diterpene 7, 8β, 9β, 14α,15β-pentaacetoxy-3β-benzoyloxy-1α, 5β-dihydroxyjatropha-6(7), 12-diene (1). The other peak at Rt = 7.963 min was annotated to a jatrophane diterpene, 1α, 7, 8β, 9β, 14α, 15β-hexaacetoxy-3β-benzoyloxy-5β-hydroxyjatropha-6(7), 12-diene (2) corresponding to the molecular ion [M+Na]+ detected at m/z 781.3040 (Figure 2(c)) (Table 4). Both compounds were previously reported from the methanolic extract of P. tithymaloides latex. The chemical structures of these compounds are depicted in Figure 3."

TA043628_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the urgency of discovering new anti-schistosomal drugs due to potential praziquantel resistance. Medicinal plants like Pedilanthus tithymaloides offer promising leads. The hydroethanolic extract's cercaricidal and schistosomicidal activities are compared with other plants, linking efficacy to diterpenoids and other metabolites. The extract's low cytotoxicity and high selectivity index (19.26 for cercariae) underscore its potential as a safe and effective treatment.","The search for new anti-Schistosoma drugs has intensified due to the report of some S. mansoni strains probably resistant to the reference drug, praziquantel. Consequently, there is an urgent need to discover cheap and safe alternatives for schistosomiasis control. Using medicinal plants as the best approach to identify new compounds to control schistosomiasis is one of the viable and promising research leads. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the potential effects of plant-derived products on cercariae and adult worms of S. mansoni. Although the wide range of its pharmacological properties, the biological activities of Pedilanthus tithymaloides against the life stages of S. mansoni have not yet been reported. In this context, we have highlighted the antischistosomal activity of P. tithymaloides by in vitro tests using raffia wine and hydroethanolic extracts of the stem bark on S. mansoni cercariae and adult worms. In vitro tests with different stages of Schistosoma are valuable tools to evaluate the schistosomicidal properties of a drug and determine its mode of action. According to Moraes et al., compounds with schistosomicidal activity can be effective in different ways: prophylactically by causing the death of cercariae and/or schistosomula, suppressively by inhibiting oviposition, and curatively by causing the death of adult worms. Therefore, we firstly examined the activity of the raffia wine and hydroethanolic extracts of P. tithymaloides against S. mansoni cercariae. Infection with schistosomes occurs when cercariae pass through unbroken skin and enter the body. As a result, interrupting the cercarial penetration into the skin is a potential mode of interrupting schistosomiasis transmission and thus the disease. Results of the current study showed varying cercaricidal activity of plant extracts. Although both extracts have inhibited cercariae viability, the hydroethanolic extract was the most potent by killing all cercariae over 60 minutes without any significant cytotoxicity against mouse hepatoma cells when tested at the same range of concentrations. Our findings are comparable to the reported data on Rauwolfia vomitoria, Ozoroa pulcherrima, Eryngium triquetrum, Balanites aegyptiaca, Caralluma dalzielli, Sida acuta, and Sida rhombifolia. However, at the same time of incubation (120 min), the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides was more potent than R. vomitoria ethanolic extract and O. pulcherrima aqueous extract. On the other hand, it was less active than O. pulcherrima methanolic extract and S. acuta and S. rhombifolia hydroethanolic extracts. Furthermore, researchers correlated the cercaricidal activity of plant extracts with their secondary metabolites. Various bioactive constituents such as steroids, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, phenols, diterpenes, triterpenes, coumarins, and saponins have already been identified in Pedilanthus sp.. Therefore, although other possible active compounds might be present in the extract, we could link the cercaricidal activity of P. tithymaloides to the annotated diterpenoids 1 and 2. It has also been reported that the efficacy of Origanum compactum against S. haematobium cercariae was attributed to its terpenoids. Most recently, Mohammed et al. have assigned the anthelmintic activity of the aqueous extract of Caralluma dalzielli against the cercariae stage of S. mansoni to his high terpenoids content. On the other hand, Raveen et al. have stipulated that the larvicidal action of P. tithymaloides leaves against the vector of the dengue fever Aedes aegypti could be assigned to flavonoids, phenols, and steroids that induced larval mortality. Moreover, the latex from Euphorbia sp. has been shown to act on both the snail vector and the parasite. Consequently, we could ascribe the cercaricidal activity of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark to its terpenoids, phenols, flavonoids, and steroids contents. The ability of P. tithymaloides to kill both adult male and female schistosomes was also evaluated during this study. Our results showed that the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark induced worms' death associated with the significantly reduced motor activity of surviving ones. Previous assays screening the schistosomicidal activity of some plant extracts or isolated compounds have revealed similar results. However, the difference in survival time between male and female worms suggested that males were more susceptible than females. Similar findings were reported by others while exposing schistosomes to medicinal plant-derived compounds or products such as Garcinielliptone FC, dihydrocitronellol, an alkaloid-rich fraction from Ruta graveolens L., and the Brazilian red propolis. The schistosomicidal activity of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark may be due to its jatrophane diterpenoids. Such compounds have been previously identified in the methanolic extract of P. tithymaloides latex. Furthermore, they have been reported for their antimalarial and antituberculous activities and antiplasmodial activity against the K1 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Additionally, some terpenoids are known to kill adult S. mansoni worms by altering their cholinergic nervous system. The motility of schistosomes implies neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin, neuropeptides, and glutamate. The reduction in S. mansoni motor activity after incubation in the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark could be the consequence of its interference with the mechanism of concentration-relaxation of worm's smooth muscles. It has also been demonstrated that terpenoids cause complete separation of paired worms and tegumental disruption. Through this action, they can impair the parasite's motility. Therefore, the effectiveness of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark against S. mansoni worms may be due, at least in part, to the jatrophane diterpenoids. Establishing that a drug candidate cannot induce cytotoxicity at therapeutic concentrations is crucial. The US NCI plant screening program stipulates that a crude extract with in vitro cytotoxic activity has an IC50 less than 20 μg/mL following incubation of cells between 48 h and 72 h. According to this, IC50 of the hydroethanolic extract (983.50 μg/mL) was approximately 50 times greater than 20 μg/mL, indicating the very low cytotoxicity of this extract on mouse hepatoma cell lines. The relative effectiveness of a drug candidate in inhibiting parasite growth compared to inducing cell death is defined as the therapeutic index or selectivity index. Therefore, it is desirable to have a high therapeutic index (>2), giving a maximum anthelmintic activity with minimal toxicity on the cells. The selectivity index of the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem bark was 19.26 for cercaricidal activity and 1.34 for schistosomicidal activity. These findings reveal that this extract is strongly active against S. mansoni cercariae but relatively effective against adult schistosomes."

Stem Barks. Abstract: Schistosomiasis control remains a public health concern, and there is a need to evaluate new strategies for targeting larval and adult stages of the parasite. As Pedilanthus tithymaloides is empirically used to treat schistosomiasis, it becomes essential to know its effective action scientifically. This study assessed the cercaricidal and schistosomicidal activity of P. tithymaloides stem barks raffia wine extract (RwPt) and hydroethanolic extract (HePt). Different concentrations of these extracts were tested against cercariae (31.25-1000 µg/mL) and adult worms (62.5-2000 µg/mL) of Schistosoma mansoni. Niclosamide-olamine 5% (1 µg/mL) and praziquantel (10 µg/mL) were used as pharmacological controls. Cercariae viability was determined every 30 min for 180 min, and adult worms' motor activity and viability after 24 and 48 h incubation. In addition, cytotoxicity and phytochemical analysis were performed. HePt was lethal to cercariae and adult worms with LC50 of 73.91 µg/mL after 60 min of incubation and 731.17 µg/mL after 48 h of incubation, respectively. Furthermore, a significant reduction of 94.44% in motor activity was observed in surviving worms at the concentration of 2000 µg/mL. RwPt was less effective on S. mansoni cercariae with an LC50 of 617.86 µg/mL after 180 min and on adult worms with a mortality rate of 9.83% at 2000 µg/mL for 48 h incubation. Both extracts showed a weak cytotoxicity profile with an IC50 of 983.50 µg/mL for HePt and more than 1000 µg/mL for RwPt. The LC-MS analysis of HePt allowed the detection of two annotated diterpenoids. Based on the selectivity index, the hydroethanolic extract of P. tithymaloides stem barks disclosed an intense cercaricidal activity and a moderate schistosomicidal effect with low cytotoxicity. These findings may support the potential use of Pedilanthus tithymaloides as a natural product or a source of natural-derived compounds for interrupting schistosomiasis transmission."

TA007083_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the structural and biological diversity of marine bacteria-derived natural products, emphasizing terpenes as a significant class with diverse skeletal structures and bioactivities, and introduces the discovery of terretonin N from Nocardiopsis sp.","The adaptation of marine bacteria to harsh environments has led to a rich biological and genetic diversity, so that structural diversity and complex molecular architectures became one of their key features of natural products with a remarkably broad range of biological activities [1–7]. Accordingly, they represent a potential source of new bioactive compounds for industrial, agricultural, environmental, pharmaceutical, and medical applications [8]. However, there are still many potential sources of new bioactive natural products from bacteria, as many habitats are yet unexplored [9]. Terpenes are an interesting class of bioactive compounds, which are produced biogenetically through either mevalonate or non-mevalonate pathways, comprising diverse skeletal structures (hemi-, mono-, sesqui-, di-, sester-, tri-, sesquart-, and tetraterpenes), and represent the largest group of natural products. They are native to plants (including macroalgae), invertebrates (sponges, soft corals), and fungi [10]. Recently, several terpenoidal and steroidal compounds with unique structures and activities were explored from actinobacteria, highlighting theses microorganisms as attractive sources of diverse bioactive compounds [11–13]. One such class of terpenes is known as sesterterpenoids and/or meroterpenoids, a relatively small group of terpenoids found in terrestrial plants, insects, fungi, lichens, and marine organisms [10,14–17]. They exhibit various bioactivities including antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, antifeedant, and antiaggregatory effects [18–23]. plants, insects, fungi, lichens, and marine organisms [10,14–17].

TA007083_R_0001,"The study investigates the fumigant toxicity of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil against Sitophilus zeamais adults, demonstrating dose- and time-dependent mortality. LC50 values decreased over 72 hours, with terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol identified as the most potent constituents. Enzyme inhibition (AChE, GST, CarE) was observed, followed by partial recovery after 24 hours. RNA-Seq analysis revealed differential gene expression linked to metabolic and respiratory pathways, validated by qRT-PCR.","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais. The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed."
TA007083_R_0002,"RNA-Seq analysis of S. zeamais exposed to M. alternifolia essential oil identified 3,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), predominantly up-regulated. Functional annotation revealed enrichment in metabolic and respiratory pathways, including cytochrome P450s and ABC transporters. qRT-PCR validated the RNA-Seq data, confirming dysregulation of detoxification and energy metabolism genes.","To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C). A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes). To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil. To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable."
TA007083_D_0001,"The study reports the isolation and characterization of a new meroterpenoid, Terretonin N, from the strain Nocardiopsis sp. LGO5, along with seven known compounds. The strain was isolated from a sediment sample in Helwan, Egypt, and maintained under specific conditions. The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the strain are described, including its growth on various media, spore morphology, and phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.","The strain Nocardiopsis sp. LGO5 was isolated from a sediment sample collected from a lake in Helwan, Egypt. The strain was cultivated on starch-nitrate medium containing 50% natural sea water and incubated at 30 °C. The pure culture was maintained in glycerol at −80 °C and deposited at the Microbial Chemistry Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt. Nocardiopsis sp. LGO5 forms a well-developed white aerial mycelium that turns into grey after 21 days, producing pale brown soluble pigments on starch nitrate agar and inorganic salt agar, whereas no melanoid pigments are formed on either ISP media 6 or 7. The strain shows white aerial mycelium on yeast extract-malt extract agar. Cellobiose, galactose, glucose, maltose, and xylose, resp., were used as sole carbon sources. The strain grows in the presence of 10% (w/v) NaCl at 30 °C, 37 °C and 40 °C. Microscopically, the spores of LGO5 appear as long chains elongated to open spirals or zig-zags with a smooth surface. Genetically, 1270 bp of the 16S rRNA gene sequence was amplified from a pure culture of the strain LGO5 using PCR, sequenced, and analyzed using a BLAST-based approach. Phylogenetic analysis of this 16S rRNA gene sequence confirmed a very close relationship of the isolate LGO5 to Nocardiopsis spp. The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbour-joining method, and the evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7. Based on the mentioned characteristics, it was confirmed that the strain LGO5 belongs to Nocardiopsis sp., and it has been recorded in the GenBank database (accession no. MF619951). Additionally, the genomic DNA of LGO5 has been tested twice in PCR analysis using either a bacteria-specific primer or a fungi-specific primer. The results showed a specific band in the PCR product using the bacteria-specific primer. Contrarily, the PCR product using the fungal primer did not show any band on agarose gel electrophoresis."

The absolute configuration was determined by X-ray crystallography, revealing (S) configuration for most chiral centers except C-14, which has an (R) configuration. The study also discusses the biosynthetic origin of terretonins and the potential of bacteria to produce terpenoids.","Chemical screening, monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), of the bacterial extract exhibited several bands with a wide range of polarities. Non-UV-absorbing compounds were detected as intensive pink to violet bands with anisaldehyde/sulfuric acid. UV absorbing bands exhibited pink, yellow, or brown coloration with anisaldehyde/sulfuric acid. Separation of the produced metabolites by the strain was carried out using a series of chromatographic techniques. The physicochemical properties of terretonin N (1) are listed in Table 1. Compound 1, a moderately polar colourless solid, appeared on TLC as an intensive pink spot that changed to violet on spraying with anisaldehyde/sulfuric acid and heating. The molecular formula of 1 was determined as C26H38O7 by negative mode ESI-HR-MS, indicating the presence of eight double bond equivalents (DBE). The 1H-NMR spectrum together with HSQC data exhibited six methyl singlets and one methyl doublet. An oxymethine group resonating at δH 4.81 (m, H-17) was shown to be attached to a methyl group (H-25) based on the coupling constant (6.4 Hz) and H,H COSY crosspeaks. The 13C/DEPT/HSQC NMR spectra showed 26 resonance signals, corresponding to seven methyl groups, three methylene groups, and seven methine groups. The relative stereochemistry of compound 1 was deduced from NOESY cross-peaks. The absolute configuration of terretonin N was established by X-ray structure determination (anomalous dispersion) of a single crystal grown from an acetone solution. The chiral carbons C-3, C-5, C-6, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-13, and C-17 have (S) configuration, while C-14 is the only stereocenter that has an (R) configuration. Terretonins are meroterpenoids biosynthetically derived from 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid (DMOA), which is cyclized by terpene cyclase to form a terpenoid. Recently, it has been reported that bacteria harbor numerous genes coding for terpene cyclases, in addition to terpene synthases, which are widely distributed in bacteria as well. This underscores the eminent capability of bacteria to produce terpenoids with high similarity to those obtained from fungi."

TA019019_I_0001,"The introduction discusses the complexity of volatiles in honey bee colonies, their sources, and their role in social behaviors, highlighting the lack of research on volatiles emitted by live honey bee larvae and their food, and introduces the study's focus on identifying and analyzing these volatiles across different larval instars using SPDE and GC-MS.","Volatiles occur in honey bee colonies as a complex mixture, determined by pheromones produced by bees, and other chemicals emitted by beeswax, honey, pollen and larval food [\[1\]](#page-12-0). These volatiles have been identified as alcohols, aldehydes, benzenoid compounds, carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons, ketones and terpenoids [\[1\]](#page-12-0). Volatiles in honey bee colonies are easily received by bees through antennal reception, sometimes over long distances. Therefore, using volatiles is an efficient means to moderate bee social behaviors. With regard to the volatiles that maintain social cohesion, most come from adult worker bees, such as the alarm pheromone inducing defensive behavior of honeybees [\[2\]](#page-12-1), the Nasanov pheromone triggering aggregation [\[3\]](#page-12-2), and other volatiles that transmit recognition cues. A few volatiles are detected in queens specifically [\[4\]](#page-12-3). Very little effort has been made to determine the volatiles emitted directly by intact and alive honey bee larvae. In contrast, the nonvolatile chemicals of honey bee larvae are widely studied by solvent extraction methods [\[5](#page-13-0)[–7\]](#page-13-1). (*E*)-β-Ocimene is the only identified volatile chemical produced by live worker larvae. There is evidence for the existence of other larval volatiles, because different chromatogram peaks in addition to (*E*)-β-ocimene were discovered [\[8\]](#page-13-2), but their compositions are not clear. There is also a lack of information about how these unknown larval volatiles change with larval ![](_page_0_Picture_17.jpeg) development. However, an understanding of the composition and content variation of volatiles during larval development is necessary for interpreting their functions. Food provided to honeybees could directly or indirectly affect honeybee volatile production. There is evidence that food shortages might stimulate worker bee larvae to release more (*E*)-β-ocimene [\[9\]](#page-13-3), and feeding honeybee worker larvae essential oils via diet supplements may change their volatiles [\[10\]](#page-13-4). However, the volatiles extracted from worker larval food have not been reported. Only volatile carboxylic acids were identified in drone larval food, and other unidentified non-acidic volatiles were noteworthy [\[11\]](#page-13-5). If the volatiles of the worker larval food were analyzed and combined with volatiles analysis of the worker larvae, it would provide a deep insight into the relationship between volatiles in larvae and their food during the same larval instar. In this paper, we analyzed the volatiles from worker larvae and their food at different instars, using solid phase dynamic extraction (SPDE) combined with high resolution gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through this research, we discovered new volatiles associated with developing worker larvae and their food that have been previously overlooked."
TA019019_M_0001,"The study utilized SPDE coupled with GC-MS to analyze volatile compounds emitted by honeybee worker larvae and their food across different developmental stages. The SPDE needle, coated with polydimethylsiloxane and active charcoal, was used for volatile extraction. GC-MS was employed for qualitative and quantitative analysis, with compounds identified using mass spectra and retention times. Statistical analyses, including PCA and one-way ANOVA, were performed to assess differences in volatile concentrations.","The volatiles of grouped larvae at three development stages were monitored. Group sizes were 20 second-instar (2nd-instar) larvae, 10 fourth-instar (4th-instar) larvae, and 10 fifth-instar (5th-instar) larvae. The larval food volatiles were also detected at different stages. To monitor changes in volatiles with respect to ontogeny, the amount of volatiles released by individual larva was determined. To compare volatiles content between larvae and food, the amount of volatiles released per unit weight of sample were calculated. Larvae and food were carefully transferred into 20 mL glass vials. Before analysis, 2 µL of 0.1 mg/L hexadecane hexane solution on a strip of filter paper was added as an internal standard for quantification. Clean empty vials were analyzed separately as controls to remove background interference. Volatile extraction was performed using SPDE (solid phase dynamic extraction) equipment installed in a CTC-Combi-PAL auto sampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland), as described by Castro. The SPDE needle (SPDE-01/AC-50-56, 50 µm × 56 mm), coated with 90% polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and 10% active charcoal (AC) was preconditioned before use. The equilibration between sample and headspace lasted for 30 min at 35 ◦C in an incubation pool. After equilibration, the extraction procedure occurred as follows: An extraction volume of 1 mL, agitator temperature of 35 ◦C, headspace syringe temperature of 35 ◦C, −30 strokes, and a filling/ejecting speed of 25 µL/s. During the equilibration and extraction procedure, the larvae were alive and isolated from food for more than 45 min. The needle was then withdrawn and introduced into the injection port of the gas chromatograph, and pumped with 1 mL nitrogen at 100 µL/s for desorption and at 250 ◦C for 2 min in splitless mode. GC-MS analysis was performed using a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph-2010 equipped with a DB-5ms capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) coupled to a Shimadzu Quadrupole-2010 Mass Spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The oven program was as follows: 35 ◦C for 2 min, 35–200 ◦C at 5 ◦C/min, 200 ◦C for 2 min, 200–250 ◦C at 10 ◦C/min, then 250 ◦C for 3 min. Injector temperature was maintained at 250 ◦C, transfer line temperature was 250 ◦C, and ion source temperature was 200 ◦C. Helium was used as the carrier gas, at a flow rate of 1.7 mL/min."
TA019019_M_0002,"Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to identify and measure volatile compounds. Compounds were identified using mass spectra and retention times, with linear retention indices calculated for further verification. Quantitative analysis involved calibration curves derived from standard compounds. Statistical analyses, including PCA and one-way ANOVA, were performed to evaluate differences in volatile concentrations among treatments.","The identification of the compound with authentic standards was performed by comparing the mass spectra (Wiley6 and NIST05) and retention times to those of authentic standards. Compounds without standards were identified by comparing the mass spectrum peaks with data system libraries (Wiley6 and NIST05) and other published spectra (Mass Spectrometry Data Centre 1974). Additionally, the linear retention indices (LRI) of the compounds were calculated by injecting a series of n-alkanes (C10–C25) (o2si Smart Solutions) into the GC-MS on two columns of different polarities under identical conditions. Authentic standards (listed in Supplementary Data, Table S1) purchased from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany) were serially diluted with hexane to make standard solutions. The peak areas on the total ion chromatogram were used for quantification. The calibration curve derived from a step-series of standard compounds for individual target compounds was built by plotting the area ratio of target compounds to the internal standard against the concentration ratio. The concentrations of volatile compounds were calculated based on the corresponding calibration curves. Principal component analysis (PCA) using a correlation matrix was applied to the data to establish relationships between the different samples and their volatile compounds. The SPSS software package Version 21 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. A one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) was used to test for significant differences in volatile compound concentrations among treatments. Figures were created using SigmaPlot version 12 for Windows (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA)."
TA019019_R_0001,"The study investigated the volatile compounds emitted by honeybee worker larvae (Apis mellifera L.) and their food using SPDE-GC-MS. (E)-β-Ocimene was the primary volatile detected in live larvae, but other compounds were also identified, including terpenoids, aldehydes, hydrocarbons, an ester, and a ketone. The second-instar larvae exhibited significantly higher terpenoid content, leading to greater overall volatile emissions compared to other larval stages. Additionally, larval food contained higher levels of aldehydes and hydrocarbons than larvae from the fourth to fifth instar. This research provides new insights into volatile composition changes during larval development.","Title: Volatiles from Different Instars of Honeybee Worker Larvae and Their Food. Abstract: (E)-β-Ocimene was the only volatile chemical found to be emitted by whole, live worker larvae of Apis mellifera L. when sampling in the vapor phase. In addition to (E)-β-ocimene, there is evidence for the existence of other volatiles, but the changes in their composition and contents remain unknown during larval development, as are their differences from larvae to larval food. We investigated volatile components of worker larvae and larval food using solid phase dynamic extraction (SPDE) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Nine compounds were identified with certainty and six tentatively, including terpenoids, aldehydes, hydrocarbons, an ester and a ketone. The contents of volatiles in the second-instar worker larvae differ greatly from those in larvae of other stages. This is mainly attributable to terpenoids, which resulted in the second-instar worker larvae having significantly higher amounts of overall volatiles. Larval food contained significantly higher amounts of aldehydes and hydrocarbons than the corresponding larvae from the fourth to fifth-instar. We discovered volatiles in worker larvae and their food that were never reported before; we also determined the content changes of these volatiles during larval development."
TA019019_R_0002,"The fumigation toxicity of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil against Sitophilus zeamais adults was evaluated, showing dose- and time-dependent mortality. The highest dose (11.97 mg/L air) caused 92.04% mortality after 72 h, with LC50 values decreasing over time. Terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol were the most toxic constituents. The oil also significantly inhibited AChE, GST, and CarE enzymes in S. zeamais, with effects peaking at 12–24 h before partial recovery. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 3,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), mostly up-regulated, linked to metabolic and respiratory disruptions. Key pathways affected included cytochrome P450s and xenobiotic metabolism. qRT-PCR validated the RNA-Seq results, confirming the reliability of transcriptomic data.","Result: To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais. The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed. To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C). A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes). To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil. To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable."
TA019019_D_0001,"The discussion highlights the significance of terpenoids as major volatile constituents in worker bee larvae, particularly in the 2nd instar, where their concentration is significantly higher than in larval food. These terpenoids, including (Z)-β-ocimene, (E)-β-ocimene, (E,Z)-alloocimene, and α-terpineol, are likely produced by the larvae themselves, supported by the presence of terpene synthases in larvae. Some of these compounds, such as (E)-β-ocimene, have been identified as larval pheromones, while others like (Z)-β-ocimene and α-terpineol are known pheromones in other insects. The potential role of these terpenoids in controlling Varroa destructor is also discussed, given their repellent effects on mites. Additionally, the presence of sesquiterpenes like cedrol, possibly derived from nearby plants, is noted.","Terpenoids have previously been reported as characteristic products of the Nasanov gland of worker bees and include nerol, geraniol, (*E*) and (*Z*)-citral, nerolic acid, geranic acid and (*E*, *E*)-farnesol [\[14\]](#page-13-8). (*E*)-β-Ocimene can be emitted by established mated queens [\[4\]](#page-12-3). In the present study, we found that terpenoids are the major constituents of worker bee larvae. Larvae and food at the 2nd instar had a greater similarity of dry substance weight per unit volume compared to other stages. Assuming that larvae and food at the 2nd instar had similar densities, larvae would have released significantly higher amount of terpenoids than food; thus, these terpenoids, such as (*Z*)-β-ocimene, (*E*)-β-ocimene, (*E*, *Z*)-alloocimene and α-terpineol, were likely produced by the larvae. Some terpene synthases have been identified in larvae [\[9\]](#page-13-3). The terpenoid concentration could be diluted in old larvae because body fluid accounts for most of their weight. Under these conditions, terpenoid contents in larvae were still significantly greater than in food, suggesting that compounds such as (*Z*)-β-ocimene, (*E*)-β-ocimene (t2) and (*E*, *Z*)-alloocimene could be identified as larval volatiles. (*E*)-β-ocimene was determined to be a worker larval pheromone in a previous study [\[12\]](#page-13-6). (*Z*)-β-Ocimene and α-terpineol have not been reported as honeybee volatiles, but they have been indicated as pheromones in other insects. (*Z*)-β-Ocimene could be released by calling males of the Caribbean fruit fly (*Anastrepha suspensa*) [\[15\]](#page-13-9); α-Terpineol is reported as a compound of the male-produced aggregation pheromone secreted by the spined soldier bug (SSB) *Podisus maculiventris* [\[16\]](#page-13-10). (*Z*)-β-ocimene, (*E*)-β-ocimene and (*E*, *Z*)-alloocimene were once reported as the components of *Tagetes minuta* essential oil, which is highly lethal to *V. destructor* [\[17\]](#page-13-11). α-Terpineol was demonstrated to have a repellent effect on the mite in a laboratory assay, and may therefore repress its entry into the brood cells of hives [\[18\]](#page-13-12). These terpenoids might be noteworthy in *V. destructor* control. There are sesquiterpenes identified as pheromones. (*E*)-b-Farnenese is an aphid alarm pheromone [\[19\]](#page-13-13). In this study, cedrol is a tentatively identified sesquiterpene with tertiary alcohol functionality. This alcohol could easily eliminate to give mixtures of α- and β-cedrene, these sesquiterpenes might be gathered by bees from gum and pollen of *Cedrus deodara* planted nearby the apiary."
TA019019_D_0002,"The discussion shifts focus to aldehydes and hydrocarbons, noting that aldehydes are more abundant in larval food than in larvae, suggesting they are secreted by worker bees rather than the larvae themselves. This aligns with previous findings of aldehydes in pollen and hive environments. Hydrocarbons, which play roles in transpiration reduction and nestmate recognition, show increasing content in larvae during development, supporting the hypothesis that they are produced by the larvae. In contrast, hydrocarbon content in food decreases, indicating a different origin, likely from worker bees. The presence of aliphatic esters, such as ethyl 2(E)-decenoate, and (E)-geranylacetone in larvae is also discussed, with the latter showing a dramatic increase during the capping stage, suggesting a specific role in larval development. The need for further research to trace the origins of these volatiles and validate tentatively identified compounds is emphasized.","All aldehydes detected in this study have been previously reported as the pheromone from calling males of *Galleria mellonella* [\[20\]](#page-13-14) and the volatiles of hives. The aldehydes are emitted by adult worker bees [\[21\]](#page-13-15) and virgin queens [\[22\]](#page-13-16) and are present in enclosed brood combs containing active larvae and attending workers [\[1\]](#page-12-0). Our results found that aldehyde content per unit weight was higher in larval food than in larvae. This supports the assumption that aldehydes are secreted by worker bees, because larval food is a material that is manipulated by worker bees. This is consistent with the findings of Torto et al. [\[23\]](#page-13-17) who reported these aldehydes in pollen. The result also explains why aldehyde contents in food did not show significant fluctuations during larval development. Aldehyde contents in larvae also remained steady, regardless of larval growth, except that a1 disappeared after the 2nd instar. Hydrocarbons have transpiration-reducing functions in arthropods. They include linear and branched, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, with different numbers of carbon atoms ranging from 15 to 35 [\[24\]](#page-13-18). Some of these compounds function in nestmate recognition and social acceptance [\[25\]](#page-13-19). Pentadecane has been reported as a larval volatile [\[26\]](#page-14-0). It was detected in nurse bees [\[27\]](#page-14-1) and queens at liftoff [\[28\]](#page-14-2), coupled with heptadecane. Octadecane is found in comb wax, with worker bees treated with this compound becoming less acceptable to their untreated nestmates [\[29\]](#page-14-3). It is released by the clearwing moth (*Paranthrene diaphana*) as female sex pheromone [\[30\]](#page-14-4). If we assume that cuticular hydrocarbons have an even and constant distribution on the surface of larvae, hydrocarbon content should increase with larval volume. A previous report has indicated that the level of tricosane and pentacosane would increase with drone larval development [\[31\]](#page-14-5). In the present study, hydrocarbon content increased at different degrees in individual larvae during larval development. To some extent, this provides another support for the hypothesis. In food, the hydrocarbon content showed different degrees of decrease in per unit weight. This suggests that the production of hydrocarbons in food is independent from that in larvae. In other words, hydrocarbons in food are affected by the food provider, while hydrocarbons in larvae are affected by the larvae themselves. Aliphatic esters are known as another group of pheromones secreted by insects. For example, ethyl acetate is a male pheromone produced by the Mediterranean fruit fly (*Ceratitis capitate)* [\[32\]](#page-14-6). Acetate and propionate esters are found in the poison gland reservoir of *Myrmecina graminicola* [\[33\]](#page-14-7). In honeybee colonies, aliphatic ester is also ubiquitous. Decyl decanoate is secreted by virgin queens from the tergal gland; ethyl oleate is produced by forager bees, suppressing the onset of foraging among younger bees. Ethyl and methyl esters of palmitic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, and oleic acids are brood pheromones mediating the communication between brood and worker bees [\[14\]](#page-13-8). Ethyl 2(*E*)-decenoate is tentatively identified in honeybees for the first time in the present study. Ethyl 2(*E*)-decenoate was once tentatively identified as one of the major compounds from fermented sugar baits for lepidopteran species resulting from sugar decomposition during the fermentation process [\[34\]](#page-14-8). (*E*)-Geranylacetone has been previously identified as a queen volatile [\[28\]](#page-14-2), a male-produced sex pheromone of cerambycid beetle (*Hedypathes betulinus*) [\[35\]](#page-14-9) and a male-produced aggregation pheromone of the brown spruce longhorn beetle (*Tetropium fuscum*) [\[36\]](#page-14-10). Concentrations of this compound in larvae did not show obvious changes with the growth of individual larvae, and the concentrations only displayed a dramatic increase during the capping stage (the 5th instar). No significant differences in the concentrations of this compound were found in food at different stages, either. This may suggest that the compound is released by larvae for a specific role in this particular period. When tracing the origins of the volatiles of worker larvae and larval food, the following factors need to be considered in the future: the volatiles of the adult worker bees, the in-hive matrix (such as honey, pollen, propolis and wax), and even the out-hive plants published by other studies based on the same locality. Moreover, the constancy of volatile components in worker larvae samples from different localities should be established. Additionally, more qualitative analysis should be conducted to the tentatively identified volatiles. Finally, only a single extraction method was applied in this study, and the use of more advanced extraction or detection methods for worker larvae volatiles might yield additional compounds."

TA047926_I_0001,"The introduction outlines the challenges of treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) due to its heterogeneity and lack of effective targeted therapies, highlighting the need for new therapeutic agents like triterpenoid saponin AG8 from Ardisia gigantifolia stapf., which has shown cytotoxic effects on TNBC cells.","Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) lack estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression and account for approximately 15-25% of total breast cancer cases. TNBCs are highly recurrent and metastatic with poor prognosis and often occur in young patients. Common hormone therapy or targeted therapies are inefficient for TNBCs because of the deficiencies in necessary receptors, and therefore, combination chemotherapy treatments are usually given to TNBC patients; however, drug resistance and adverse side effects occur frequently. TNBC is a very heterogeneous disease with at least six molecular subtypes: immunomodulatory (IM), mesenchymal (M), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), basal-like 1 and 2 (BL1 and BL2), and luminal androgen receptor (LAR). TNBC can also be divided according to race into African American (AA) type and Caucasian (CA) type. These TNBC subtypes have different responses to standard of care (SOC) treatments, because each of them has its own unique ontology. Since most currently available therapies cannot benefit TNBCs, therapeutic agents with minimal toxicities and better efficacy need to be developed. According to our previous studies, triterpenoid saponins from Ardisia gigantifolia stapf. showed cytotoxic activities towards several kinds of cancer cells. Some of the triterpenoid saponins showed prominent cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells. Among them, triterpenoid saponin AG8 isolated from A. gigantifolia stapf. inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. In this study, AG8 was selected for further analysis on different TNBC cell types including MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157. This study is aimed at investigating the effects of AG8 on the oxidative stress pathway and cell death induction in TNBC cells."

After treatment with AG8 for 24 h, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in MDA-MB-231 cells (AG8: 0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 μM), MDA-MB-157(AG8: 0, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 μM), and BT-549 cells (AG8: 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 μM) were analyzed using the SOD WST-1 assay kit, GSH assay kit, and MDA assay kit from Nanjing Jiancheng Bio-Engineering Institute (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, #A001-3, #A006-2 and #A003-4) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NAC (final concentration 4 mM) was added to the TNBC cells 1 h before AG8 treatment, and then, the cells were cultured with NAC and AG8 for 24 h before the measurement of cell apoptosis. BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells were treated with different concentrations of AG8 (1.0 and 1.5 μM) with or without NAC (4 mM) for 24 h. The TNBC cells were collected and lysed in total protein extraction reagent with proteinase inhibitors. The protein concentrations were measured by the BCA protein assay kit. Protein samples from treated TNBC cells were separated by SDS–PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membranes, which were washed and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 1 h at 25°C. Subsequently, the membranes were washed and incubated with indicated primary antibodies against cleaved-caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome C, AKT, pAKT, ERK, and pERK (Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA) at 4°C overnight and further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at 25°C for 1 h. The load protein bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescent detection reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). All data were presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) from three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Statistical comparisons were evaluated using Student's t-test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant."
TA047926_R_0001,"The study investigates the effects of triterpenoid saponin AG8 from Ardisia gigantifolia stapf. on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, focusing on its cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and oxidative stress pathways. AG8 showed dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability in MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells, with varying sensitivities among subtypes. AG8 impaired mitochondrial function, increased ROS levels, and altered oxidative stress markers (GSH, SOD, MDA). NAC, an antioxidant, counteracted these effects. AG8 also modulated apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome c) and signaling pathways (ERK, AKT), indicating mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.","To determine whether AG8 differentially affects TNBC cell proliferation, its effects on MDA-MB-231 (MSL, CA), BT-549 (M, CA), and MDA-MB-157 (MSL, AA) were investigated. As shown in Figure 1(b), AG8 inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the IC50 values were 3.80, 0.73, and 1.38 μM, respectively. AG8 showed stronger cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-157 than MDA-MB-231 cells, indicating that the AA may be more sensitive to AG8 than CA TNBC cell lines. MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 are CA type TNBCs; AG8 showed increased cytotoxicity to BT-549 (IC50 0.73 μM) compared to MDA-MB-231 (IC50 3.80 μM), which means AG8 could have more effects on M subtypes than on MSL subtypes. To determine the effects of AG8 on cell apoptosis, the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells were treated with AG8 for 24 h and double stained with annexin-V/PI in order to assay for apoptosis using flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 1(c), after treatment with 0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 μM AG8 for 24 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells in MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells was increased significantly. Incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells with high doses of AG8 resulted in higher levels of apoptosis than H2O2 which was used as positive control. These results indicated that AG8 could reduce cell viability by increasing the number of early or late apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner. The colony formation assay indicated that AG8 decreases the percentage of colonies in a dose-dependent manner, but this effect was lower than that of H2O2 (Figures 1(d) and 1(e)). Taken together, all the above results indicated that AG8 inhibited TNBC cell proliferation and caused apoptosis in vitro. To examine the effects of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) on the viability of AG8-treated TNBC cells, MDA-MB-231 (AG8, 4.0 μM), BT-549 (AG8, 1.0 μM), and MDA-MB-157 (AG8, 1.5 μM) cells were pretreated with NAC (4 mM) prior to 24 h incubation with AG8. As shown in Figure 2, NAC alone had no effect on the viability of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells, while increased the viability of MDA-MB-157 cells. Following treatment with AG8, viability of MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells was dramatically decreased to 40.3%, 65.3%, and 50.3%, respectively, and in the AG8+NAC group, cell viability was significantly increased to 89.3%, 93.6%, and 72.6%, respectively. These results suggested that NAC could significantly counteract the negative effects of AG8 on TNBC cell viability (Figure 2)."
TA047926_R_0002,"AG8's impact on mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in TNBC cells was further explored. AG8 impaired mitochondrial uptake of MitoTracker Red CMXRos, which was reversed by NAC. AG8 increased ROS levels and altered oxidative stress markers (GSH, SOD, MDA), with NAC mitigating these effects. The study also revealed AG8's role in modulating apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome c) and signaling pathways (ERK, AKT), highlighting mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Notably, MDA-MB-157 (AA subtype) exhibited unique responses, suggesting subtype-specific mechanisms.","It is known that mitochondria dysfunction is one of the many causes of apoptosis. Thus, we examined the effects of AG8 on the mitochondria activity of TNBC cells using MitoTracker Red CMXRos dye. Before the treatment with AG8, MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells had many bright red, dot-like fluorescence structures in the cytoplasm of cells (Figure 3(a)). After AG8 treatment for 24 h; the red fluorescence in the cytoplasm was decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner suggesting that AG8 impaired MitoTracker Red CMXRos uptake by mitochondria. In the AG8+NAC group, the red fluorescence increased dramatically compared to the AG8-alone group at the same concentration (Figure 3(a)). These results clearly demonstrated that the severely impaired function of the mitochondria following treatment with AG8 can be recovered by treating TNBC cells with NAC. Oxidative reactions in mitochondria result in the ROS generation, which are converted to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase. As shown in Figure 3(b), AG8 significantly increased the levels of intracellular ROS in the three TNBC cells compared to the control group, and the antioxidant NAC significantly decreased the levels of intracellular ROS. Upon pretreatment with NAC, the AG8-mediated ROS was significantly inhibited. In MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells, AG8 even showed better activity than the positive control H2O2. To determine the potential effects of AG8 on oxidative stress, the levels of GSH, SOD, and MDA in TNBC cells treated with or without AG8 were further measured. As shown in Figure 4, after incubation with AG8 for 24 h, the levels of GSH and SOD in MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells were decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and the levels of MDA were increased in dose-dependent manner. The effects of antioxidant NAC on the GSH, SOD, and MDA levels of AG8-treated TNBC cells were also examined. In MDA-MB-157 cells, the levels of GSH and SOD in the AG8+NAC group (1.5 μM + 4 mM) were increased, and the MDA levels were decreased significantly compared with those in the AG8-alone group at the same concentration. Regarding MDA-MB-231 cells, NAC showed no significant effects on GSH levels, but the SOD and MDA levels were increased and decreased compared with the AG8-alone group at the same concentration, respectively. In BT-549 cells, compared with the 1.0 μM AG8 group, NAC showed significant effects only on MDA levels. In summary, AG8 showed cytotoxicity against TNBC cells by affecting the levels of GSH, SOD, and MDA that are associated with oxidative stress pathway, but different TNBC subtypes had different sensitivities to AG8 and NAC. After treated with AG8, NAC, or AG8+NAC for 24 h, the expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, and cytochrome c proteins in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells were assayed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 5(a) in BT549, AG8 significantly increased cytochrome c expression, and this effect was counteracted by NAC. However, in MDA-MB-157 cells (AA subtype), AG8 only slightly increased the release of cytochrome c, and NAC also showed a weak effect on this increase (Figures 5(a) and 5(c)). In both BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells, AG8 significantly increased and decreased the expression of Bax and Bcl-2, respectively, and NAC rescued their levels. For both TNBC cells, AG8 treatment increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio significantly (Figure 5(b)), suggesting that the Bcl-2 family of proteins is involved in AG8-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. AG8 significantly increased the expression levels of caspase-3 in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells, and pretreatment with NAC apparently blocked this effect (Figure 5(d)). These findings suggest that AG8 could induce apoptosis of BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells through the mitochondria-dependent pathway. We examined the modulatory effects of AG8 on pAKT and pERK in TNBC cells and found that after 24 h of AG8 treatment, the expression of pAKT and pERK in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells decreased significantly (Figure 6(a)). In BT549, pretreatment with (4 mM NAC) prior to AG8 treatment, significantly restored the levels of pAKT and pERK, was restored compared with those in the AG8 group (Figure 6(b)). In MDA-MB-157 cells, NAC restored the AG8-induced decrease in pERK without affecting the decrease in pAKT (Figure 6(b)). These findings demonstrated that AG8-induced ROS production may activate MAPK and AKT activation and triggers mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in TNBC cells."
TA047926_D_0001,"The study investigates the effects of triterpenoid saponin AG8 from Ardisia gigantifolia stapf. on different triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. AG8 showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity, particularly in African American (AA) and mesenchymal (M) subtypes, and induced apoptosis through oxidative stress pathways. The study highlights the role of ROS, mitochondrial dysfunction, and modulation of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release) in AG8's mechanism of action. Differences in response between TNBC subtypes suggest potential selective cytotoxicity.","Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) account for 12–20% of all diagnosed breast cancers and have poor overall patient survival. The treatment options for TBNC are limited to surgery, radiation, or conventional chemotherapy because few targeted therapies are available. TNBC is a very heterogeneous disease and can be divided into different molecular subtypes: immunomodulatory (IM), mesenchymal (M), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), basal-like 1 and 2 (BL1 and BL2), and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) or African American (AA) type and Caucasian (CA) type. Each TNBC subtype has its own unique ontology and responds differently to standard of care (SOC) treatments. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effects of AG8, a natural triterpenoid saponin from Ardisia gigantifolia stapf., on different TNBC subtypes, namely, MDA-MB-231 (MSL, CA), BT-549 (M, CA), and MDA-MB-157 (MSL, AA). Apoptosis is a kind of cell death that is genetically controlled, and apoptosis induction is explored as a therapeutic approach for cancer. We found that, regarding MSL TNBC cell lines, AG8 showed stronger cytotoxicity to the AA subtype (MDA-MB-157) than CA (MDA-MB-231). For CA type TNBCs, AG8 showed much more cytotoxicity to M subtypes (BT-549) than to MSL subtype (MDA-MB-231). These results indicating that AG8 may have selective cytotoxicity against AA and M TNBC subtypes need to be confirmed in future studies. Furthermore, our results indicated that the number of early or late apoptotic cells was dose-dependently increased by AG8."
TA047926_D_0002,"AG8 induces oxidative stress in TNBC cells, leading to apoptosis. ROS accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruption of redox homeostasis (reduced SOD/GSH, increased MDA) are key mechanisms. NAC pretreatment partially reverses AG8's effects, confirming ROS involvement. AG8 also modulates apoptosis-related proteins (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release) and inhibits ERK/AKT phosphorylation, with subtype-specific differences in response. The study suggests AG8 as a potential TNBC treatment candidate due to its ability to trigger mitochondrial apoptosis pathways.","ROS contain unpaired electrons and are generated by partial oxygen reduction. Overproduction of ROS can further cause instability of lipids, proteins, and DNA. ROS accumulation is more harmful to cancer cells because the levels of oxidative stress in cancer cells are higher than that in normal cells. Some triterpenoid saponins have been reported to induce apoptosis via ROS accumulation in cancer cells. Therefore, antioxidants (NAC) are often used to promote oxygen reduction. Strikingly, pretreatment with NAC reduced the AG8-induced cytotoxicity, demonstrating that the production of ROS had a role in AG8-induced TNBC cells' apoptosis. In the CA subtype of TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549), cellular activities were recovered similar to those of the DMSO group, while in cells pretreated with NAC, the cellular activity was still significantly decreased compared with that of the DMSO group. These results suggest that AG8 may induce AA subtype TNBC cell apoptosis through not only ROS pathways. Mitochondrial depolarization is one of the major causes of mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial dysfunction is critical for cell apoptosis. Impairment of mitochondria membrane integrity will cause depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and finally mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. The integrity was examined using MitoTracker Red CMXRos dye. Treatment of cells with AG8 resulted in a dose-dependent damage of the mitochondria membrane, and this effect was reversed by NAC in TNBC cells. Cellular redox homeostasis is maintained by the balance between antioxidants and prooxidants. Intracellular SOD and GSH are critical antioxidants that protect the cellular components from oxidative damages. While it is produced under oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, MDA can reflect oxidative damage to the plasma membrane. To further evaluate the effects of AG8 on oxidative stress, we analyzed for the levels of these important cellular antioxidative and prooxidative enzymes in AG8 stimulated TNBC cells. We found that AG8 could significantly decrease the levels of antioxidants SOD and GSH, suggesting that it may initiate redox imbalance in TNBC cells and subsequently induce apoptosis. Our study showed that AG8 significantly increased the levels of the prooxidative enzyme MDA in TNBC cells. It was demonstrated that AG8 might be an appropriate candidate for TNBC treatment because it induces oxidative stress. Bax and Bcl-2 play crucial roles in cell apoptosis. The mitochondria could initiate an apoptotic cell death pathway through cytochrome c release. The balance of pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family determines the ultimate apoptosis/survival fate of cells. When the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is increased, the mitochondrial membrane potential is lost, cytochrome c is released, and subsequently, caspase-9 is activated, resulting in the activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 can lead to cell death characterized by cell membrane blebbing, destruction of cell structure, and DNA fragmentation. In AG8-treated BT-549 and MDA-MB-157 cells, the expressions of Bax and Bcl-2 were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, and the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was significantly reduced by NAC treatment. AG8 could induce cytochrome c release from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, and this effect was also counteracted by NAC. This indicated that AG8-induced apoptosis occurs possibly via the mitochondrial pathway. The AKT and MAPK signaling pathways are critical pathways involved in the regulation of processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Phosphorylated AKT and/or ERK can increase cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. ROS have been reported to induce apoptosis of tumor cells by activating caspases, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. The activation of AKT and/or ERK may be a key mechanism for cancer treatment. In addition, AKT may regulate cell apoptosis through modulation of Bcl-2 family members. Therefore, we investigated the cellular signaling pathways involved in AG8-induced apoptosis. We found that AG8 significantly decreased phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells. NAC could significantly restore the levels of phosphorylated ERK in both two cells, while it only reversed the dramatic decrease in pAKT levels in BT549 cells and had no effects on the decrease of pAKT in MDA-MB-157 cells. These results indicated that ROS may have little effects on the AG8-induced decease of pAKT in MDA-MB-157 (AA subtype), and these different reactions between different subtypes need to be further examined. Therefore, AG8 may interfere with ERK and AKT pathways and triggers mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells."

Induces Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Apoptosis through Oxidative Stress Pathway. Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are associated with poor patient survival because of the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressions. Our previous studies have shown that the triterpenoid saponin AG8 from Ardisia gigantifolia stapf. inhibits the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. In this study, the effects of AG8 were further analyzed in different TNBC cell types: MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells. AG8 inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-157 cells in a dose-dependent manner and showed stronger cytotoxicity to African American (AA) and mesenchymal (M) subtypes than Caucasian (CA) and mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) subtypes, respectively. AG8 impaired the uptake of MitoTracker Red CMXRos by the mitochondria of TNBC cells in a dose-dependent manner, and this was recovered by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). AG8 affected GSH, SOD, and MDA levels of TNBC cells, but different TNBC subtypes had different sensitivities to AG8 and NAC. In addition, we found that AG8 increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the levels of cytoplasmic cytochrome c and significantly decreased phosphorylation of ERK and AKT in BT549 and MDA-MB-157 cells. AG8 elicited its anticancer effects through ROS generation, ERK and AKT activation, and by triggering mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in TNBC cells. AG8 had selective cytotoxic effects against the AA and M TNBC subtypes and markedly induced MDA-MB-157 (AA subtype) cell apoptosis through pathways that were not associated with ROS, which was different from the other two subtypes. The underlying mechanisms should be further investigated."
TA047926_C_0002,"The discussion highlights AG8's potential as a selective anticancer agent for TNBC subtypes, particularly AA and M, through ROS generation, ERK/AKT inhibition, and mitochondrial dysfunction. While AG8's mechanisms require further study, its differential effects on TNBC subtypes—especially the ROS-independent apoptosis in MDA-MB-157 cells—suggest subtype-specific therapeutic potential.","Discussion: Although the mechanisms and therapeutic effects of AG8 on TNBC need to be further investigated, the present results indicated that AG8 showed anticancer effects by inducing ROS, inhibiting ERK and Akt signaling pathways, and direct impairing the function of mitochondria. In addition, we found that different TNBC subtypes showed different sensitivities to AG8, and therefore, AG8 may have selective cytotoxic effects against AA and M TNBC subtypes. It is interesting that AG8 dramatically induced MDA-MB-157 (AA subtype) cell apoptosis through pathways not only associated with ROS, in contrast to the other two subtypes. The mechanisms of the effects of AG8 need to be further examined."
TA044260_I_0001,"The study investigates the protective effect of escin, a triterpene saponin glycoside from horse chestnut, on Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis in mice, focusing on its modulation of immune cell infiltration and signaling pathways like Nrf2/HO-1, TNF-α/JNK, and IL-22/STAT3.","The current study aims to investigate the possible protective effect of escin, the active constituent of a natural mixture of triterpene saponin glycoside, against immune-mediated hepatitis driven by concanavalin A (Con A) and to elucidate its possible underlying mechanisms. Adult male mice were administered Con A (15 mg/kg, intravenously) for 8 h. In the treated groups, mice were pretreated with escin daily (10 mg/kg in CMC, orally) for 4 days before Con A intoxication. In addition, escin was administered in a group to examine its effect on normal mice. Our results showed that escin inhibited Con A-induced elevation in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and LDH) and curbed the Con A-induced hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis together with abrogating the death pathway, JNK. Coincidentally, escin has shown a reduction in neutrophil, CD4+ T cell, and monocyte infiltration into the liver. In addition, escin modulated the cellular oxidant status by compensating for the Con A-depleted expression of the transcription factor Nrf2 and the stress protein hemeoxygenase-1. These effects were in good agreement with the restraining effect of escin on Con A-instigated overexpression of NF-κB and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A. Interestingly, Con A provoked the cellular protective pathway IL-22/STAT3, which was revoked by the escin pretreatment. In conclusion, escin shows extended antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinecrotic, and anti-apoptotic effects against Con A-induced immune-mediated hepatitis. These effects may collectively be via suppressing immune cell infiltration into the liver and selective modulation of Nrf2/HO-1, TNF-α/NF-κB, TNF-α/JNK, and IL-22/STAT3 signaling pathways."
TA044260_I_0002,"The introduction provides background on autoimmune hepatitis, the role of Con A in modeling immune-mediated hepatitis, and the pharmacological properties of escin, setting the stage for investigating its potential protective effects.","Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive inflammation of the liver with an underestimated prevalence and unsatisfiable complete remission therapeutic output (Francque et al.). Experimental discovery of new agents to manage immune-mediated hepatitis, including AIH, viral hepatitis, and iatrogenic immune-mediated hepatotoxicity, has been hindered by relatively limited animal models (Heymann et al.). Concanavalin A (Con A) is a sugar-binding legume lectin that is extracted from the jack beans, Canavalia brasiliensis. It has a key role in drug development for human AIH, as it induces a model of acute immune-mediated hepatitis characterized by specific target organ toxicity, T cell-mediated liver disease due to its T lymphocyte mitogenic ability, and clinical resemblance (Sharma et al.).Con A-induced liver damage arises from the activation and recruitment of T lymphocytes to the liver. It was shown that after Con A intravenous injection, T lymphocytes assemble in the hepatic sinusoids and proliferate into CD4+ cells (Hazem et al.). These T helper cells subsequently overproduce various inflammatory mediators causing the so-called cytokine storm. In addition, CD4+ T cells recognize the MHC of resident macrophages, resulting in overproduction of the main pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α (Shaker et al.). Besides, Con A can induce hepatocellular apoptosis by both a caspase dependent pathway and a mitochondrial pathway (Liu et al.).Beta-escin (Escin) is the active constituent of a natural mixture of triterpene saponin glycoside derived from the horse chestnut, Aesculus hippocastanum (Berti et al.). Escin has been shown to have multiple pharmacodynamic effects including anti-edematous, anti-inflammatory, venotonic, and free radical scavenging effects (Ottillinger and Greeske). Currently, escin is therapeutically indicated for chronic venous insufficiency, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, hematoma, venous congestion, diabetic retinopathy, and postoperative edema. On the other hand, recent studies has shown its promising efficacy in multiple models of inflammation including a high fat diet (Avci et al.), mouse paw edema (Matsuda et al.), neuronal ischemia reperfusion injury (Gao et al.), and rat pleuritis models (Yang et al.). Yet, it is not fully investigated whether escin may have a protective effect on Con A-induced AIH or not, and if so, its underlying mechanisms. Accordingly, our current study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of escin on this type of hepatitis and elucidate its possible underlying mechanisms."
TA044260_M_0001,"The study utilized adult male BALB/c mice to investigate the protective effects of escin against Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis. Mice were divided into four groups: control, Con A, escin, and escin plus Con A. Escin was administered orally for four days, and Con A was injected intravenously. Serum and liver samples were collected for biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical analyses. Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, LDH) were measured, and liver tissues were examined for necrosis, apoptosis, and immune cell infiltration using H&E staining and immunohistochemistry for markers like Ly6G, CD4+ T cells, and F4/80. Apoptosis markers Bax and active caspase-3 were also assessed.","Adult male BALB/c mice (25–30 g) were supplied from Vacsera (Giza, Egypt) and maintained in a controlled setting with tap water and food ad libitum. Animal handling and experiments were reviewed and approved by the research ethics committee of Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt (Code number: 2022-46). Mice were randomly divided into four groups (6 each): Group I (Control): animals were administered escin vehicle [CMC (0.5%) orally for 4 days] and Con A vehicle [normal saline (0.9%) intravenously (i.v.) in the tail vein 8h] before killing. Group II (Con A): animals received Con A (20 mg/kg) i.v. in the tail vein as 0.2% w/v solution in normal saline (0.9%) for 8h. Group III (escin): animals received escin (10 mg/kg/day) orally for 4 days as 0.1% w/v solution in 0.5% CMC in addition to Con A vehicle as described in Group I. Group IV (Escin+Con A): animals received escin, as described in group III, and Con A, as described in group II, 2h after the last escin dose. Eight hours after Con A injection, mice were anesthetized by thiopental sodium (70 mg/kg, i.p). For hepatic histological and immunohistochemical evaluations, the right median lobe was isolated and fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin in normal saline. To isolate serum samples, cardiac blood was collected via puncturing and centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min (at 4 ℃). Samples of liver homogenate were prepared by homogenizing a portion from the left median lobe of the liver in 20 mM Tris–HCl (containing 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), followed by centrifugation at 3000g for 20 min (at 4 ℃) and collection of supernatants. Serum and homogenate samples were stored at − 80 °C for subsequent analysis. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were measured in serum as hepatocellular injury biomarkers by biochemical kits (Spectrum Diagnostics, Egypt). Fixed and paraffinized liver sections (5 μm thick) were dewaxed in xylene, mounted on slides, and stained with hematoxylin–eosin (H&E). The slides were then examined for necroinflammation and immune cell infiltration according to the criteria of the histological activity index (HAI). Additionally, immunohistochemical expression level of the neutrophil marker Ly6G in liver was evaluated via immunostaining by the avidin–biotin complex method using anti-mouse Ly6G antibody. Similarly, CD4+ T cell and monocyte infiltration in liver was also evaluated by immunohistochemical determination of the expression levels of the CD4+ T cells and macrophage marker F4/80 via immunostaining using mouse monoclonal CD4+ T cell antibody and anti-mouse F4/80 antibody. Hepatocyte apoptosis was determined by examining the pro-apoptotic markers Bax and active caspase-3 via immunostaining by the avidin–biotin complex method using anti-Bax and anti-cleaved caspase-3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies."

Hepatic Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions were determined immunohistochemically via the avidin–biotin complex method using the anti-Nrf2 rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-HO-1 mouse monoclonal antibody. Hepatic NF-κB p65 expression was determined via immunostaining by the avidin–biotin complex method using the anti-NF-κB p65 rabbit polyclonal antibody. The concentrations TNF-α, IL-17A, and IL-22 were measured by the ELISA MAX™ Deluxe set in the liver tissue lysates and sera.

To eliminate cell debris, samples were sonicated and incubated for 30 min on ice before being centrifuged at 10,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford assay. Slab gel (10%) was applied. After gel polymerization, equivalent sample concentrations (30 µg protein/sample) were loaded in the wells of sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresis was done at 125 V for about 2 h. The blotted membrane was then incubated in blocking solution for 1h at room temperature, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with a solution encompassing either anti-beta actin mouse monoclonal antibody, anti-JNK1 (phospho-T183) rabbit polyclonal antibody, or anti-phospho-STAT3 mouse monoclonal antibody.

Kruskal–Wallis by rank and the Dunn’s multiple comparison post hoc tests were used to analyze the scores of necroinflammation and immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis and graphing were performed by GraphPad Prism V8.01."
TA044260_R_0001,"The study investigates escin's protective effects against Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis in mice, focusing on liver enzyme levels, histopathology, and immune cell infiltration. Escin pretreatment significantly reduced ALT, AST, and LDH levels, mitigated hepatocyte necrosis/apoptosis, and suppressed neutrophil, CD4+ T cell, and monocyte infiltration. Histopathological analysis confirmed these findings.","Hepatocellular injury after 8h from Con A injection was evidenced by a significant increase in ALT (p < 0.01), AST (p < 0.001), and LDH (p < 0.001) serum activities in comparison with the normal mice group (Fig. 1a–c, respectively). However, administration of escin (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A significantly decreased the peak activities of ALT (p < 0.01), AST (p < 0.001), and LDH (p < 0.001) compared to Con A alone. Alternatively, escin alone did not affect serum ALT, AST, or LDH activities. As shown in Fig. 2a, liver sections from the Con A group stained with H&E showed marked necroinflammatory changes characterized by severe periportal and portal lymphohistiocytic infiltration, heavy neutrophils aggregation, and large area of necrosis in comparison with the normal hepatic histology in both the control group and the group that received escin only. However, these hepatic pathological abnormalities were markedly ameliorated upon administration of escin (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A. These results were further illustrated by semi-quantitative scoring of necroinflammation (Fig. 2b) and counting of infiltrated neutrophils (Fig. 2c). Both the hepatic necroinflammation score and the average neutrophil count were significantly (p < 0.001) greater in the Con A group than in the control counterpart, and escin administration before Con A significantly (p < 0.01 and 0.001, respectively) reduced both of them. Alternatively, escin alone had no effect on hepatic necroinflammation score or infiltrated neutrophil count. To confirm whether escin can limit Con A-instigated neutrophil infiltration in the liver, the hepatic expression of Ly6G positive cells was immunohistochemically assessed (Fig. 3a). Liver sections from the Con A group showed marked expression of Ly6G-positive cells that were negatively expressed in the control and escin groups. However, escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A markedly limited Con A-induced elevation in Ly6G-positive cell. According to semi-quantitative scoring, Ly6G expression was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the mice livers that received Con A alone in comparison to those of the normal mice. Meanwhile, hepatic Ly6G expression was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the (Escin+Con A) group compared to the Con A group (Fig. 3b). Next, CD4+ T cell infiltration in liver was evaluated by immunohistochemical assessment of its expression (Fig. 4a). Liver sections from the Con A group showed remarkably higher percentage of CD4+ T cells positive expression than those from the control group and Escin groups. Notably, upon escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A, infiltration of CD4+ T cells in the liver was strongly suppressed. Semi-quantitative scoring revealed that Con A-induced infiltration of CD4+ T cells was significant (p < 0.01) compared to the control group and that escin administration before Con A significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed this infiltration (Fig. 4b). Moreover, monocyte infiltration in the liver was evaluated by assessment of immunohistochemical expression of F4/80-positive cells (Fig. 5a). Liver sections from the control and escin groups showed negative F4/80-positive cells, while those from the Con A group showed marked expression of these cells. Conversely, escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A strongly suppressed monocyte infiltration as well. According to semi-quantitative scoring, F4/80 expression was markedly (p < 0.001) elevated in the Con A group in comparison with the control counterpart. Interestingly, escin treatment before Con A significantly curbed (p < 0.05) this elevation (Fig. 5b)."
TA044260_R_0002,"Escin modulated oxidative stress, Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, and inflammatory pathways (TNF-α/NF-κB, JNK, IL-17A). It reduced lipid peroxidation (MDA) and nitrosative stress (NOx), restored Nrf2/HO-1 expression, and suppressed TNF-α, IL-17A, NF-κB, and JNK activation. Escin also attenuated apoptosis (Bax, caspase-3) and downregulated the protective IL-22/STAT3 pathway.","Con A injection resulted in marked elevation in lipid peroxidation and nitrosative stress in liver as demonstrated by a significant (p < 0.001) increase in hepatic MDA and NOx contents (Fig. 6a, b, respectively) compared to the control group. Both hepatic MDA and NOx contents were significantly (p < 0.001) repressed upon the administration of escin (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A compared to Con A alone. Alternatively, escin alone had no effect on hepatic MDA or NOx contents compared to the control group. As all our previous results showed that using escin alone does not have any effect on the phenotype, we continued our study without the escin group. Trying to elucidate the underlying antioxidant mechanism of escin in this type of hepatitis, the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 was examined immunohistochemically. Our results demonstrated that liver sections from the control group showed marked expression of Nrf2, but the expression was very mild in the Con A group. Interestingly, pretreatment with escin markedly increased Nrf2 expression (Fig. 7a). Next, immunostained liver sections against the antioxidant protein HO-1 were evaluated and similarly showed that HO-1 was markedly expressed in the control group, but its expression was very mild in the Con A group and upon treatment with escin, the expression was moderately increased (Fig. 7c). Semi-quantitative scoring revealed that Con A elicited a pronounced (p < 0.001) reduction in the hepatic expressions of both Nrf2 and HO-1 compared to the control group, whereas escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A caused a significant (p < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively) elevation in their expression (Fig. 7b, d, respectively). When compared to the control group, Con A injection significantly (p < 0.001) elevated hepatic and serum TNF-α levels and hepatic IL-17A level as well (Fig. 8a, b, respectively). Meanwhile, escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the elevated levels of both cytokines when compared to the Con A group. Regarding NF-κB, immunohistochemical assessment of the transcription factor NF-κB p65 activation and translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 8c) revealed that Con A markedly elevated its expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus of hepatocytes. Alternatively, escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A strongly reduced this expression. According to semi-quantitative scoring, Con A caused a significant (p < 0.001) increase in NF-κB p65 expression compared to the control group, while pretreatment with escin significantly (p < 0.05) reduced its expression (Fig. 8d). Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated JNK1 protein was evaluated by western blot. Intriguingly, the results revealed that Con A injection substantially elevated the expression of phosphorylated JNK1 protein in the liver. However, escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A limited this elevation (Fig. 8e). Regarding pro-apoptotic markers, immunostained liver sections against the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (Fig. 9a) showed negative expression in the control group; however, marked expression appeared in the Con A group. Obviously, this expression was markedly decreased in the treated group. Likewise, immunostained liver sections against the apoptotic executioner caspase-3 (Fig. 9c) showed negative expression in the control group; however, marked expression appeared in the Con A group. Obviously, this expression was markedly decreased in the treated group. Semi-quantitative scoring revealed that expressions of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase-3 (Fig. 9b, d, respectively) in the livers of the Con A-challenged mice were significantly (p < 0.01) elevated when compared with those of normal mice, but was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced upon pretreatment with escin (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days. Thus, Con A-induced apoptosis was effectively ameliorated by escin. Interestingly, hepatic and serum levels of IL-22 were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated by Con A injection compared to the control group. However, these levels were significantly (p < 0.001) reduced upon escin administration (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A in comparison to the group that received Con A alone (Fig. 10a). Next, the phosphorylated STAT3 protein was evaluated by western blot. The results revealed that Con A injection strongly elevated phosphorylated STAT3 protein expression; however, this elevated expression was diminished upon treatment with escin (10 mg/kg/day) for 4 days before Con A (Fig. 10b)."

It modulated oxidative stress by enhancing Nrf2/HO-1 expression and inhibited pro-inflammatory pathways like TNF-α/NF-κB and TNF-α/JNK. Additionally, escin attenuated the IL-22/STAT3 protective pathway activated by Con A.","The current study aims to investigate the possible protective effect of escin, the active constituent of a natural mixture of triterpene saponin glycoside, against immune-mediated hepatitis driven by concanavalin A (Con A) and to elucidate its possible underlying mechanisms. Adult male mice were administered Con A (15 mg/kg, intravenously) for 8 h. In the treated groups, mice were pretreated with escin daily (10 mg/kg in CMC, orally) for 4 days before Con A intoxication. In addition, escin was administered in a group to examine its effect on normal mice. Our results showed that escin inhibited Con A-induced elevation in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and LDH) and curbed the Con A-induced hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis together with abrogating the death pathway, JNK. Coincidentally, escin has shown a reduction in neutrophil, CD4+ T cell, and monocyte infiltration into the liver. In addition, escin modulated the cellular oxidant status by compensating for the Con A-depleted expression of the transcription factor Nrf2 and the stress protein hemeoxygenase-1. These effects were in good agreement with the restraining effect of escin on Con A-instigated overexpression of NF-κB and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A. Interestingly, Con A provoked the cellular protective pathway IL-22/STAT3, which was revoked by the escin pretreatment. In conclusion, escin shows extended antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinecrotic, and anti-apoptotic effects against Con A-induced immune-mediated hepatitis. These effects may collectively be via suppressing immune cell infiltration into the liver and selective modulation of Nrf2/HO-1, TNF-α/NF-κB, TNF-α/JNK, and IL-22/STAT3 signaling pathways."
TA044260_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the limitations of current autoimmune hepatitis treatments, which often lead to relapse and incomplete responses. The study explores escin's potential as an alternative by examining its effects on Con A-induced liver injury. Escin normalized liver enzyme levels and histopathology, demonstrating no hepatotoxicity. It suppressed neutrophil infiltration and nitrosative stress, while also reducing CD4+ T cell and monocyte recruitment. Escin enhanced antioxidant defenses via Nrf2/HO-1 and inhibited pro-inflammatory TNF-α/NF-κB and TNF-α/JNK pathways. Additionally, it attenuated the IL-22/STAT3 protective pathway, suggesting a comprehensive anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective role.","The current standard treatment regimens for autoimmune hepatitis are based on immune system suppression (Czaja) with an outcome of relapse in 50–85% of adults and 60–80% of children after treatment withdrawal (Mieli-Vergani et al.), treatment failure in 9% of patients, and incomplete response in 13% of patients (Manns et al.). Such data encouraged us to dig for new strategies in the management of immune-mediated hepatitis to increase the complete remission rates. Accordingly, the main objective of our study was directed at examining the possible protective effect of escin against autoimmune hepatitis, with elucidation of the main targeted signaling pathways underlying this type of hepatitis using Con A-induced hepatitis mouse model. The results showed a significant elevation of ALT, AST, and LDH in the Con A group compared to the control group denoting liver cell injury with concomitant release of liver enzymes into the circulation. Concordantly, the histopathological examination of the H&E hepatic sections showed normal histological findings in the control group unlike the Con A group that showed marked necroinflammatory changes. The mice group that was administered escin only showed normal serum liver enzymes and normal histology denoting that escin does not possess hepatotoxic nature. On the other hand, escin pretreated group normalized the pathological changes induced by Con A. Immune cell infiltration is substantial in the development of liver injury not only by producing pro-inflammatory mediators, but also via the recruitment of other leukocytes to the hepatic tissues, and thereby augmenting the inflammatory response (Adams et al.). Neutrophils arrive at the liver as soon as 4h after Con A administration, representing the first leukocyte type to arrive at inflammation sites and, therefore, form the first line of immune defense (Bonder et al.). Our results showed that Con A intoxication resulted in heavy neutrophil aggregation in the hepatic tissue as demonstrated by histopathological examination of the H&E stain. This was also confirmed by the immunohistochemical investigation of the neutrophil marker Ly6G that showed marked expression in the hepatic sinusoids. In addition, the nitrosative stress was significantly elevated in the Con A group which can be attributed to the hepatic infiltration with neutrophils that highly express the inducible nitric oxide synthetase. Pretreating the mice with escin for 4 days was sufficient to suppress hepatic infiltration with neutrophils, as manifested by the reduction of the neutrophil infiltration, Ly6G expression and hepatic content of NOx. It has been previously reported that CD4+ T lymphocytes are the paramount stimulator of Con A-induced liver injury. Adams et al. had confirmed this by canceling the effect of CD4+ T cells, where i.v. injection of Con A was not able to develop leukocyte recruitment and hepatic inflammation (Adams et al.). Neutrophils interpose inflammatory response via recruitment other leucocytes including CD4+ T cells, where depleting neutrophils by anti-mouse antibody directed against Ly6G resulted in a marked attenuation of Con A-instigated CD4+ T lymphocyte recruitment to the liver (Tiegs et al.). Moreover, neutrophils orchestrate recruitment and differentiation of macrophages (Selders et al.). These findings were in a good agreement with our results, where the immunohistochemical analysis of CD4+ T cells and the macrophage marker F4/80 showed strong positive expression in the lectin-mediated injury group, which can be linked in part to the observed elevated neutrophil infiltration. However, the intense expression was reduced in a significant way in the escin pretreated groups. Therefore, escin not only suppressed hepatic neutrophil infiltration, but also suppressed CD4+ T cell and monocyte recruitment into the liver as well. It has been found that escin boosts endogenous antioxidant capacity via scavenging free radicals and retards oxidative degradation of lipids (Vašková et al.; Jiang et al.). This was shown by the reduction in the lipid peroxidation product MDA in the pretreated escin before Con A-challenge. In the same context, NOx of the liver assessment exhibited a marked elevation in the Con A group which was substantially lowered in the escin group. Escin directly trap NO and hinder its interaction with O2 or , thereby preventing the generation of RNOS including the highly reactive peroxynitrite (ON) (Vašková et al.). Furthermore, escin prior to Con A challenge boosted the cellular antioxidant defense mechanism as shown by the elevated expression of the Nrf2 and HO-1. Nrf2 enhances cellular antioxidant capacity by increasing the expression of genes whose protein products detoxify and eliminate ROS (Ma). Moreover, Nrf2 is a positive transcription activator of HO-1 which is an antioxidant cellular defense enzyme (Sun et al.). Collectively, escin normalized cellular oxidant status by controlling ROS and RNS levels along with boosting the cellular antioxidant capacity. Thereby, this will interfere with the inflammatory signal transduction pathways including the TNF-α pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signaling cascades. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α is chiefly produced from the activated macrophages and T lymphocytes which are highly activated in the Con A model (Balkwill). TNF-α engagement to TNFR1 is involved in activating downstream effectors and mediating programmed cell death signaling via NF-κB and stress-mediated protein kinases, JNK 1 signaling (Wajant et al.). The pro-inflammatory downstream effectors of NF-κB include activation of naïve CD4+ T cells and their differentiation into Th-17 cells which are major producers of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A, which in turn mediates monocyte and neutrophil recruitment to the site of inflammation (Liu et al.). TNF-α activates the death signaling pathway, JNK 1 that turns on the apoptotic machinery by activation of pro-apoptotic genes with the expression of death factors such as the Bax protein. In addition, JNK turns off the cell survival pathway. Finally, JNK relieves the inhibition on caspase-8 to initiate the caspase-dependent apoptosis (Weston and Davis). This vicious cycle of inflammation has been investigated in our study to elucidate the underlying mechanistic signaling of escin. The expression of the pro-inflammatory TNF-α in both serum and liver tissue was significantly elevated in the Con A group compared to the normal control, denoting the beginning of the massive inflammatory signaling in response to tissue damage. As was foreseeable, the downstream effectors of TNF-α was statistically elevated in the Con A group, where NF-κB expression was evident in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm as well as IL-17A expression in the hepatic tissue, compared to the normal control. Furthermore, western blotting of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK revealed increased expression in the lectin-induced injury group that was concordant with the apoptotic indices Bax and caspase-3. Interestingly, all these pathological inflammatory markers were crippled in a significant manner in the escin pretreated group. Although activated T cells play a well-documented role in promoting the inflammatory response, they also have a hepatoprotective role to limit the inflammatory response; otherwise the inflammation would be fatal. Evidence suggests that activated T cells produce anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic cytokines, among which is IL-22. This member of the IL-10 family acts as a cellular protective cytokine in liver injury, especially those mediated by T cells, by inducing multiple downstream effectors including STAT3 (Pickert et al.). In our study, the expression of IL-22 in both liver tissue and serum was significantly elevated in the Con A group where the T lymphocytes were simultaneously activated, confirmed by CD4+ T cell expression. However, in the escin pretreated group, where the T cells activation has been interrupted, the IL-22 expression was reduced compared to the Con A group. At the same time, western blotting of the STAT3 showed consistent results, where STAT3 expression was escalated in the Con A group, but abrogated in the Con A group pretreated with escin."

TA040161_I_0001,"The introduction outlines the prevalence and impact of membranous nephropathy (MN), its autoimmune pathogenesis involving podocyte injury due to immune complex deposition, and the role of the NF-κB pathway and TRAF6 in inflammation and disease progression.","Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the prevailing etiology of nephrotic syndrome in adults. In recent years, the incidence of MN in our nation has increased, especially among younger individuals. Heterogeneity characterizes the treatment response and disease outcome in patients with MN. While approximately one-third of patients will experience spontaneous remission, nearly 50% of those who fail to achieve remission will eventually progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which imposes a substantial societal and familial burden. MN is an autoimmune glomerular disease, and its pathogenesis is primarily attributed to podocyte injury resulting from immune complex deposition on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The deposition of immune complexes and subsequent activation of the complement system can precipitate the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which lead to inflammatory responses. Recent studies have highlighted that the NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in MN. The genomic and transcriptomic involvement of the NF-κB pathway has been demonstrated in MN pathogenesis. Patients with MN exhibit increased protein expression of NF-κB p65, and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and IκBα was shown to increase in the MN model rats, demonstrating that activated NF-κB is linked with MN. Additionally, the suppression of NF-κB leads to a reduction in proteinuria, amelioration of renal damage and inflammation, and restoration of podocyte injury in experimental MN rat models. The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family, characterized by K63-ubiquitin chain modification, acts as a scaffold for upstream complexes to activate downstream signals such as the NF-κB signaling pathway. TRAF6, a member of this family, plays a role in the pathogenesis of various renal diseases by regulating the activation of NF-κB. In adenine-induced mice, elevated renal levels of TRAF6, NF-κB p65 and p-NF-κB p65 were observed. TRAF6 silencing can protect against inflammation in LPS-induced HK-2 cells, while TRAF6 overexpression mitigates the inhibition of p-NF-κB p65 and inflammation. These findings underscore the importance of the TRAF6-mediated NF-κB pathway in regulating inflammation in renal disease. Consequently, we hypothesized that TRAF6/NF-κB axis-mediated inflammation was associated with podocyte injury and MN progression."
TA040161_I_0002,"The introduction discusses current MN treatments, their limitations, and the potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), particularly Astragalus membranaceus and its active component Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), in mitigating MN through anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects, while highlighting the need for further research on its mechanism involving TRAF6.","Current treatments for MN include steroids and immunosuppressive agents, which have side effects. The exploration of alternative adjunctive therapeutic modalities is of great importance. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has substantial therapeutic effects on various chronic diseases, including renal disease. Nevertheless, due to the complex composition of traditional Chinese medicinal agents, the precise mechanisms by which these interventions ameliorate pathological conditions remain to be elucidated. Previous reports have shown that Astragalus membranaceus (Huang-Qi) is commonly used in the treatment of membranous nephropathy, which can reduce proteinuria and promote diuresis and detumorment by regulating immunity, anti-inflammation, antioxidation and other mechanisms, is commonly used to treat MN. Adjunctive use of A. membranaceus combined with supportive care or immunosuppressive therapy has shown to improve the response rate and serum albumin (ALB) concentration and reduce proteinuria and serum creatinine levels compared to immunosuppressive therapy alone in MN patients. In addition, MN patients resistant to cyclosporine and mycophenolate achieved complete remission after taking TCM containing A. membranaceus. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is a key active constituent of A. membranaceus. Its effects include reducing the serum creatinine concentration, mitigating proteinuria, and attenuating complications such as anemia and malnutrition. Studies have shown that AS-IV possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and immunomodulatory properties. It exerts kidney-protective effects by mitigating podocyte apoptosis, abating oxidative stress, and inhibiting the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway, all of which contribute to renal injury. However, there is currently an absence of direct evidence showing the impact of AS-IV on the function of TRAF6. In this study, we investigated the influence of AS-IV on TRAF6 using a passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) rat model and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms that drive podocyte inflammatory damage through the TRAF6/NF-κB pathway."
TA040161_M_0001,"The study utilized Sprague-Dawley rats to establish a passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) model by injecting sheep anti-rat FX1A serum. The rats were divided into control, model, low-dose Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), high-dose AS-IV, and prednisone groups. After a four-week treatment regimen, blood and urine samples were collected for biochemical analysis, and kidney tissues were harvested for histopathological evaluation. Techniques included hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Masson’s trichrome staining, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, and periodic acid-silver methenamine (PASM) staining to assess renal injury, fibrosis, and glomerular sclerosis.","Forty-five male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (5 weeks of age, weighing 150 ± 10 g) were purchased from Sibeifu Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing (Licence: SCXK (Beijing) 2019-0010). All rats were raised at a temperature of 20–25 °C, humidity of 30–40% and a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. The rats were provided unrestricted access to clean food and water for one week prior to the experiments. All experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (application no. 202307A045) and adhered to the guidelines stipulated by the National Animal Welfare Law of China. The handling of animals was in accordance with internationally relevant laboratory animal regulations. We established a PHN model in 36 male SD rats by injecting sheep anti-rat FX1A serum (0.8 mL/100 g body weight, PTX-002S; Probetex, San Antonio, TX), which shares a similar pathogenic mechanism and clinical manifestation of MN in humans. The nine rats in the control group received an equivalent volume of saline via intraperitoneal injection. One week after anti-Fx1 injection, the PHN rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 9 per group): a model group, a low-dose AS-IV group, a high-dose AS-IV group, and a prednisone group. Rats in the low-dose AS-IV group, high-dose AS-IV group and prednisone group were administered double distilled water (1 mL/100 g/d) containing AS-IV at doses of 20 mg/kg/d, 40 mg/kg/d, or prednisone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d, respectively. The control group and PHN model group rats received the same volume of double distilled water. All fluids and medications were administered through oral gavage one week after administration of sheep anti-rat Fx1A serum to establish the PHN model. Following a four-week treatment regimen, blood and 24-h urine samples were collected and centrifuged (3500 rpm, 4 °C). The collected urine samples were used to evaluate the 24-h urine protein excretion (24 h-UPE) levels, while the blood samples were used to measure serum creatine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), ALB, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α levels. Thereafter, all rats were intraperitoneally administered 1% pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). Kidney tissues from six rats per group were isolated and stored at −80 °C for subsequent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RT–qPCR, Western blot and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses. The remaining three rats were perfused with saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for histopathological assessment. Kidney samples were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in graded alcohol and dimethylbenzene and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned into 4 μm-thick slices for various staining techniques. The renal tissue slices were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining according to the manufacturer’s protocol and scored as previously described to evaluate renal structural injury. Renal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining using a Masson staining kit, and semiquantitative analysis was performed according to the percentage of collagen area stained in the visual field. For periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, renal tissue slices were incubated with a periodic acid solution for 5 min and sequentially with Schiff reagent for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark after being washed with ddH2O and then counterstained with hematoxylin. We used PAS staining to observe the mesangial matrix and basement membrane and evaluate glomerular sclerosis. Periodic acid-silver methenamine (PASM) staining was used to identify the GBM in kidney tissue. Kidney sections were preheated, treated with silver staining fluid and washed with distilled water. Then, the sections were incubated in 2% gold chloride solution, washed, treated in 2% sodium thiosulfate solution, washed, double stained with hematoxylin or eosin, dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and sealed with neutral gum."

MPC5 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were converted into single-cell suspensions, and the cell density was adjusted to 2 × 105 cells/mL. Subsequently, these cells were seeded in 60 mm dishes at 4 mL/well and cultured in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 overnight. The TRAF6 overexpression (TRAF6-OE) lentivirus (provided by Shanghai Genechem Co., Ltd.) was transiently transfected (MOI = 30) for 12–24 h (the specific time was determined according to the state of the cells). After that, the transfection reagent was removed, and the regular complete medium was replaced for continued culture. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were digested and replated, ensuring that the cell samples were appropriately prepared for the desired Western blot experiments. For a subset of cultured cells, the MPC5 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, blotted to dryness, and rinsed three times with 1× PBS for 5 min each. The cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10–15 min, after which the permeabilization solution was discarded, and the cells were subsequently washed three times with PBS for 5 min each. Blocks were incubated with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies against NF-κB (1:100, Abcam, ab16502) and TRAF6 (1:200, Abcam, ab137452). After washing with 1× PBS, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature in the dark for 1–2 h. Each sample was stained with propidium iodide (PI, Solarbio, C0080) for 10 min while kept in the dark. The slides were sealed with an anti-quench sealant. Fluorescence microscopy was used for observation and analysis. Total RNA was extracted from rat kidney tissues and treated MPC5 cells using a total RNA extraction kit (Solarbio, R1200), and qPCR was conducted with a TaqMan One Step RT–qPCR kit (Solarbio, T2210) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following primers were used (5′→3′) for the PHN rats: TNF-α (F): CGTGTTCATCCGTTCTCTACC, TNF-α (R): GCAATCCAGGCCACTACTT, IL-1β (F): TGATGTTCCCATTAGACAGC, IL-1β (R): GAGGTGCTGATGTACCAGTT, IL-6 (F): CCGTTTCTACCTGGAGTTTGT, and IL-6 (R): GTTTGCCGAGTAGACCTCATAG. The following primers were used for the MPC5 cells: TNF-α (F): AGGCACTCCCCCAAAAGATG, TNF-α (R): CCACTTGGTGGTTTGTGAGTG, IL-1β (F): GAAATGCCACCTTTTGACAGTGA, IL-1β (R): GTCCTCATCCTGGAAGGTCC, IL-6 (F): ACGATGATGCACTTGCAGAAA, IL-6 (R): CTGTGACTCCAGCTTATCTCTTG, GAPDH (F): GCCTCCTCCAATTCAACCCT, and GAPDH (R): CTCGTGGTTCACACCCATCA. The supernatants obtained from renal tissues and MPC5 cells were collected after lysis with prepared RIPA lysis buffer (containing 1% PMSF and 2% phosphatase inhibitors). To determine the protein concentration in the supernatant, a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Biyuntian, P0012S) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Equivalent quantities of proteins from each sample were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against nephrin (1:1000, Abcam, ab216341), desmin (1:100000, Abcam, ab32362), TRAF6 (1:2000, Abcam, ab137452), NF-κB (1:1000, Abcam, ab16502), phosphorylated NF-κB (p-NF-κB) (1:1000, Abcam, ab76302), K48 (1:1000, Abcam, ab140601), and GAPDH (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, 5174) at 4 °C overnight. Following incubation with primary and secondary antibodies and washing, the protein bands were visualized using a Tanon gel imaging system. Further analysis of the grey values associated with the protein bands was conducted using ImageJ software. The levels of IL-6 and IL-1β in the MPC5 cells were detected by commercial kits, including a mouse IL-6 ELISA kit (IC50325-1, mlbio, Shanghai, China) and a mouse IL-1β ELISA kit (mIC50300-1, mlbio, Shanghai, China), following the manufacturer’s protocol. IL-6 and IL-1β levels are expressed in pg/mL. Co-IP cell lysate was added to the tissue fragments or cells for lysis. These lysates were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for protein quantification. Lysates were incubated with an anti-TRAF6 antibody (Abcam, ab137452) or an anti-IgG antibody overnight at 4 °C. This mixture was then precipitated with 50% Protien A/G agarose bead solution and lightly shaken overnight at 4 °C. The resulting bound precipitate was separated by centrifugation. The precipitate was denatured with 1× loading buffer for 10 min at 100 °C. Western blots were subsequently performed. MPC5 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded in 60 mm dishes at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/well and allowed to adhere for 24 h. For the CHX assays, all experimental groups were treated with TNF-α + CHX (10 μg/mL; Sigma, 239765), with or without a high concentration of AS-IV. This treatment was carried out for intervals of 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h. Then, cells were harvested for Western blot experiments. For the MG132 assays, all experimental groups were treated with TNF-α + MG-132 (5 μM; Sigma, 474791) with or without a high concentration of AS-IV for 24 h. After the designated treatment period, cells were collected for Western blot and co-IP experiments."

TA040161_R_0001,"The study investigated the effects of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) on passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes, focusing on its anti-inflammatory properties and the TRAF6/NF-κB pathway. PHN rats exhibited elevated serum BUN, SCr, and 24-h urine protein excretion (UPE), along with decreased serum ALB levels, indicating kidney injury. AS-IV treatment significantly improved these parameters in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, AS-IV reduced IgG deposition in glomeruli and ameliorated renal pathology, including inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis, and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening. AS-IV also protected podocytes by restoring nephrin expression and reducing desmin expression.","To determine the effect of AS-IV on kidney injury, we treated PHN rats with AS-IV. As depicted in Figure 1(A–D), a marked increase in the serum BUN, SCr and 24 h-UPE levels occurred in the PHN rats compared with those in the control group (BUN: PHN vs. control, 56.82 ± 4.98 vs. 13.47 ± 2.51, p < 0.0001; SCr: PHN vs. control, 112.04 ± 7.71 vs. 50.40 ± 5.90, p < 0.0001; 24 h-UPE: PHN vs. control, 25.34 ± 5.04 vs. 4.22 ± 1.55, p < 0.0001). Correspondingly, there was a marked decrease in the serum ALB level (PHN vs. control, 20.30 ± 2.57 vs. 28.80 ± 1.35, p = 0.0034). In contrast, the rats in the low-dose AS-IV and high-dose AS-IV groups all exhibited decreased serum BUN, SCr, 24 h-UPE levels (BUN: PHN vs. low-dose AS-IV, 56.82 ± 4.98 vs. 45.19 ± 5.34, p = 0.0369, PHN vs. high-dose AS-IV, 56.82 ± 4.98 vs. 30.44 ± 4.83, p = 0.0002; SCr: PHN vs. low-dose AS-IV, 112.04 ± 7.71 vs. 88.57 ± 10.54, p = 0.0278, PHN vs. high-dose AS-IV, 112.04 ± 7.71 vs. 73.19 ± 7.28, p = 0.0011; 24 h-UPE: PHN vs. low-dose AS-IV, 25.34 ± 5.04 vs. 17.26 ± 3.75, p = 0.0001, PHN vs. high-dose AS-IV, 25.34 ± 5.04 vs. 13.49 ± 3.24, p < 0.0001), coupled with elevated serum ALB levels (PHN vs. low-dose AS-IV, 20.30 ± 2.57 vs. 23.65 ± 2.59, p = 0.2735, PHN vs. high-dose AS-IV, 20.30 ± 2.57 vs. 25.70 ± 2.48, p = 0.0484). In addition, immunofluorescence staining revealed that the deposition of IgG in the glomerulus was more pronounced in the PHN model group than in the control group and was substantially reduced after AS-IV treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1(E)). Together, these results confirmed that AS-IV mitigated renal injury and immune disorders in PHN rats. To detect the effect of AS-IV on renal pathology in PHN rats, we assessed glomerular lesions using HE, Masson, PAS and PASM staining. As shown in Figure 2, renal pathology, including inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 2(A)), renal fibrosis (Figure 2(B)), GBM thickening (Figure 2(C)) and GBM atrophy (Figure 2(D)), was more severe in the PHN model group than in the control group. However, AS-IV treatment significantly alleviated the above changes (Figure 2(A–D)). Notably, AS-IV improved the histopathology of kidney lesions in MN rats. To detect the effect of AS-IV on podocytes in PHN rats, we examined the expression of nephrin (the major component of podocytes) and desmin (a cytoskeletal protein in podocytes) in rat kidney tissue and observed the ultrastructure of the podocytes by electron microscopy. Compared with the control group, the fusion of podocyte foot processes was increased and the GBM was thickened in the PHN group. Compared with the PHN group, the AS-IV group exhibited some remission in foot process fusion and GBM thickening (Figure 3A). In addition, the expression of nephrin in the kidney tissue of the PHN group was reduced compared with that in the control group. In contrast, desmin expression was much greater in the PHN group than in the control group. We observed that AS-IV treatment facilitated the restoration of nephrin but decreased desmin expression (Figure 3(B–D)). The above results indicated that AS-IV successfully protected against podocyte injury."
TA040161_R_0002,"AS-IV demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) in PHN rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes. It suppressed the TRAF6/NF-κB pathway, decreasing TRAF6 and p-NF-κB levels while enhancing K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6, leading to its proteasomal degradation. In vitro studies on MPC5 cells confirmed that AS-IV inhibited TNF-α-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation and proinflammatory cytokine expression. Overexpression of TRAF6 (TRAF6-OE) reversed AS-IV's anti-inflammatory effects, confirming the critical role of TRAF6 in the NF-κB pathway and AS-IV's mechanism of action.","As illustrated in Figure 4, the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in the kidneys of the model group were greater than those in the control group (p < 0.05). In contrast, treatment with a low-dose or a high-dose of AS-IV significantly reduced the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β (Figure 4). These findings suggested that AS-IV effectively suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the kidneys of PHN rats. To understand the anti-inflammatory effects of AS-IV, immunofluorescence and Western blot were used to evaluate the expression profiles of targets of the TRAF6/NF-κB pathway. In parallel, the polyubiquitination status of TRAF6 was probed using co-IP. In the model group, the levels of TRAF6 and p-NF-κB were increased in the kidney tissues of PHN rats (Figure 5). Intriguingly, a concomitant decrease in K48-ubiquitination of TRAF6 occurred relative to the control group. Overall, AS-IV intervention alleviated the levels of TRAF6 and p-NF-κB and the ubiquitination of TRAF6 in PHN rats. MPC5 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and 6-well plates. Following pretreatment with different concentrations of AS-IV (low concentration: 25 μM, moderate concentration: 50 μM, high concentration: 100 μM), the cells were subsequently stimulated with TNF-α (40 ng/mL) for 24 h. The results underscore the substantial role of AS-IV in revitalizing cells (Figure 6(A)) while concurrently influencing the concentration-dependent decrease in the mRNA levels of key proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, elicited by TNF-α stimulation (Figure 6(B–D)). We found that in normal MPC5 cells, NF-κB predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Conversely, in TNF-α-activated MPC5 cells, an increase in nuclear NF-κB expression was detected. Interestingly, AS-IV attenuated the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 7(A,B)). Furthermore, TNF-α-activated MPC5 cells also expressed significantly more p-NF-κB, and AS-IV suppressed the production of p-NF-κB (Figure 7(C,D)). In addition, AS-IV significantly downregulated TRAF6 expression (Figure 7(C, E–G)) while concurrently enhancing the K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 in comparison to that in MPC5 cells stimulated with TNF-α alone (Figure 7(H,I)). To elucidate the mechanism by which AS-IV decreased the protein level of TRAF6, we investigated TRAF6 protein stability by evaluating the effects of AS-IV in the presence of CHX. As demonstrated in Figure 8(A,B), AS-IV treatment reduced TRAF6 protein stability. Notably, TRAF6 is degraded through proteasomal pathways that often involve K48-linked ubiquitination. Building upon previous findings that indicated that AS-IV induced upregulation of TRAF6 K48 ubiquitination, we incubated MPC5 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to determine whether AS-IV-mediated TRAF6 degradation was intricately linked to K48 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent processes. As shown in Figure 8(C,D), the addition of AS-IV substantially increased the number of K48-linked ubiquitin chains compared with the addition of MG132 alone. This observation indicated that AS-IV promoted TRAF6 degradation by enhancing K48 ubiquitination, thus enhancing the proteasomal pathway involved in TRAF6 turnover. First, the efficacy of TRAF6-OE was assessed using qPCR, and a significant increase in TRAF6 mRNA levels occurred (Figure 9(A,B)), suggesting successful transfection of the TRAF6-OE lentivirus. As depicted in Figure 9(C,D), TRAF6-OE led to an increase in p-NF-κB, IL-6 and IL-1β levels. In addition, AS-IV treatment of TRAF6-OE cells failed to attenuate the NF-κB pathway, whereas it effectively reduced p-NF-κB, IL-6 and IL-1β levels in the control group. Taken together, these findings suggested that TRAF6-OE inhibits the anti-inflammatory potential of AS-IV in MPC5 cells by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway."

Here, we investigated the effects of AS-IV on passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms of MN. Serum biochemical parameters, 24-h urine protein excretion and renal histopathology were evaluated in PHN and control rats. The expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (p-NF-κB), the expression of associated proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) and the ubiquitination of TRAF6 were measured in PHN rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes. We detected a marked increase in mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β and in the protein abundance of p-NF-κB and TRAF6 within the renal tissues of PHN rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes.

This effect was concomitant with the suppression of NF-κB pathway activation and decreased expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and TRAF6. AS-IV decreased TRAF6 levels by promoting K48-linked ubiquitin conjugation to TRAF6, which triggered ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In summary, AS-IV averted renal impairment in PHN rats and TNF-α-induced podocytes, likely by modulating the inflammatory response through the TRAF6/NF-κB axis. Targeting TRAF6 holds therapeutic promise for managing MN."
TA040161_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the role of inflammation and NF-κB in MN pathogenesis and AS-IV's therapeutic effects. AS-IV reduced proteinuria, serum creatinine, and renal pathology in PHN rats, while suppressing TRAF6 and NF-κB activation. In vitro, AS-IV enhanced podocyte viability and reduced inflammatory cytokines. The study also found AS-IV promotes TRAF6 degradation via K48 ubiquitination, inhibiting NF-κB. Previous research supports AS-IV's renoprotective effects, including anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties. The findings suggest AS-IV's potential in MN treatment by targeting TRAF6/NF-κB, though further clinical validation is needed.","Inflammation and the NF-κB pathway have been shown to play an integral role in podocyte injury in the pathogenesis of MN. Notably, TCM interventions using animal MN models showed promise in ameliorating this condition by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. This led to an exploration of the impact of TCM on renal inflammation and podocyte injury in MN patients. In the present study, we focused on elucidating the protective effects of AS-IV on podocyte injury, with a specific emphasis on the regulation of the TRAF6 and NF-κB signaling pathways in PHN rats and MPC5 cells. In our initial in vivo experiments using PHN rats, we observed that AS-IV administration led to reductions in proteinuria and serum creatinine levels that were coupled with increases in serum ALB in both the low- and high-dose AS-IV groups. Notably, the amelioration of clinical manifestations was dose-dependent. Furthermore, AS-IV administration mitigated pathological manifestations, including the fusion of podocyte foot processes, IgG deposition, GBM thickening and collagen fibrosis in renal tissues. The increase in the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in the kidneys of PHN rats was effectively reversed by AS-IV treatment. In vitro experiments involving MPC5 cells further revealed that AS-IV could enhance cell viability while concurrently reducing the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in response to TNF-α stimulation. Based on these results, we determined the key molecules and pathways by which AS-IV acted on MN. Our investigation revealed upregulated expression of TRAF6 and p-NF-κB, accompanied by increased translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus and decreased K48-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF6 in both the kidney tissues of PHN rats and TNF-α-activated MPC5 cells. Remarkably, AS-IV treatment counteracted these effects, leading to an attenuation of the observed changes. Furthermore, insights gained from experiments involving MG132 and CHX treatments suggested that the degradation of TRAF6 was predominantly governed by K48 ubiquitination and the proteasome-associated pathway. Finally, we discovered that TRAF6 overexpression inhibited the anti-inflammatory potential of AS-IV by activating the NF-κB pathway. These novel findings illuminate the therapeutic potential of AS-IV in ameliorating renal dysfunction and podocyte injury in MN patients. These effects are closely intertwined with the capacity of AS-IV to modulate inflammation mediated by TRAF6 ubiquitination and the NF-κB signaling pathway. The traditional Chinese herb A. membranaceus is a widely recognized for its therapeutic effects and low toxicity and is commonly used for treating infections, inflammation and cancer. Among its major bioactive ingredients, AS-IV possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and immune-promoting properties that safeguard multiple organs, such as the heart, lung, kidney and brain. Previous studies revealed that AS-IV has a wide range of renoprotective effects. For example, AS-IV can ameliorate renal tubular epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by high glucose through the CX3CL1-RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In addition, during the early stage of renal ischaemia–reperfusion injury (IRI), AS-IV can reduce proinflammatory responses and macrophage infiltration by inhibiting the NF-κB (p65)/Hif-1α pathway and enhancing Smad7 expression. The protective effects of AS-IV on podocytes have also been documented, with studies indicating its ability to inhibit podocyte apoptosis by attenuating oxidative stress via PPARγ-Klotho-FoxO1 axis activation in diabetic nephropathy. Moreover, AS-IV can alleviate cytoskeletal injury through the Wnt/PCP pathway in puromycin aminonucleoside-stimulated podocytes. In this study, we found that AS-IV increased the K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6, consequently suppressing the overexpression of p-NF-κB, a proinflammatory cytokine, and the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus in both PHN rats and TNF-α-stimulated MPC5 cells. Consistent findings from in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the protective effect of AS-IV on MN is due to its anti-inflammatory effects on podocytes. Podocytes play a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and regulating renal permeability to diverse molecules, making them primary targets for immune deposits that accumulate beneath the glomerular capillary wall and lead to the subsequent formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in MN. Podocyte injuries caused by the MAC include protein kinases, reactive oxygen species, transcription factors, growth factors, proteinases, and stress pathways. Among these factors, an accumulating body of evidence underscores the significance of the NF-κB signaling pathway in immune modulation and in the pathogenesis of MN. In this study, we established a PHN rat model and utilized TNF-α-stimulated MPC5 cells to simulate MN-related renal lesions and podocyte injury. Consistent with previous observations, we detected increased p-NF-κB levels in the kidney tissues of PHN rats and TNF-α-stimulated MPC5 cells and increased NF-κB nuclear expression in TNF-α-activated MPC5 cells. A prior study showed that AS-IV reinstated podocyte morphology and cytoskeleton structure in MAC-stimulated podocytes. In addition, AS-IV decreased NF-κB activity; suppressed TNF-α, MCP-1 and ICAM-1 expression in kidney tissue to protect against renal damage in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; and inhibited podocyte EMT via the SIRT1-NF-κB pathway in glucose-stimulated podocytes. This study revealed that AS-IV downregulated p-NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β expression in the kidneys of PHN rats and in TNF-α-stimulated podocytes. These findings demonstrate that the NF-κB pathway and related proinflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of MN and that AS-IV has potential for kidney protection through the NF-κB pathway. Recent studies have shed light on the role of TRAF6 polyubiquitination in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway activation. TRAF6 functions as an unconventional E3 ubiquitin ligase, with its K63-ubiquitin chain being capable of self-modification and consequent activation of NF-κB, thereby participating in the inflammatory process. Conversely, the K48-ubiquitin chain tags substrates for proteasomal degradation. The TRAF6-mediated suppression of ubiquitination impedes NF-κB signaling in podocytes, epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells in the kidneys of IRI rats. Studies have shown that TRAF6 is involved in various kidney diseases. Increased TRAF6 expression has been detected in renal tissues of MRL/Ipr mice (lupus nephritis model), acute kidney IRI model mice and LPS-induced podocytes. However, changes in TRAF6 expression and function in MN have not been studied. We speculated that TRAF6 might also be involved in the pathogenesis of MN by regulating the NF-kB pathway. Our findings revealed elevated TRAF6 expression and reduced K48-mediated TRAF6 ubiquitination in the kidney tissues of PHN rats and TNF-α-stimulated MPC5 cells. Li et al. discovered that AS-IV treatment can reduce the expression of TRAF6 and subsequently inhibit NF-κB phosphorylation. Our results are consistent with those of Li et al.; we observed that AS-IV reversed TRAF6 and p-NF-κB expression and promoted TRAF6 ubiquitination in PHN rats and TNF-α-induced MPC5 cells. Our results support the potential for AS-IV to regulate NF-κB through the modulation of TRAF6 expression and ubiquitination, indicating that AS-IV is a promising clinical target for treating MN patients. However, there are some limitations to our study. First, our investigations were limited to murine models and cultured cells, warranting further validation in MN patients to verify the clinical effect. Second, the impact of AS-IV on normal rats has not been explored and requires future examination."

TA037737_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the significance of influenza viruses, particularly H2N2 and H3N2, in causing pandemics and the role of neuraminidase inhibitors like oseltamivir in treatment, while also noting the emergence of resistant strains.","The influenza virus, which is one of the main causes of acute respiratory infections in humans, can lead to annual epidemics and infrequent pandemics. The two influenza pandemics of the 20th century, “Asian Influenza (1957/H2N2)” and “Hong Kong Influenza (1968/H3N2)” resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2–3 million people globally. Today, their descendants continue to cause the majority of influenza infections in humans. So far as it is learned that the most effective antiviral drug is the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor, which target the NA glycoproteins of influenza A and B virus.The release of new virions from the infected cell is a key step in the influenza life cycle and need neuraminidase (NA) to cleave the α-ketosidic linkage between terminal sialic acid and an adjacent sugar residue. The NA inhibitors were designed to prevent the key step by blocking the active site of enzyme and thus allow sufficient time for the host immune systems to remove infected viruses. Consistent efforts have been devoted to the development of NA inhibitors, using the crystal structure of the N2 sub-type NA protein. Indeed, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is the representative NA inhibitor that has proven to be uniquely applicable oral drug in clinical practice for the treatment of influenza infection. However, with an increase in medical use, the oseltamivir-resistant strains have been found and probably lead to a large scale outbreak of novel pandemic flu."

The essential oil is very appreciated for its characteristic pleasant and long lasting woody, earthy, and camphoraceous odor, as well as for its fixative properties, being suitable for use in soaps and cosmetic products.

Moreover, the plant is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as it presents various types of pharmacological activity according to the composition of the oil. Patchouli alcohol, as the major volatile constituent of patchouli oil, has been found to strongly inhibit H1N1 replication and weakly inhibit B/Ibaraki/2/85 replication. To the best of our knowledge, the anti-influenza virus (H2N2) activities of patchouli alcohol have not been evaluated yet. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-influenza A virus (H2N2) activity of patchouli alcohol by MTT assay and mouse influenza model. On such basis, explicitly solvated docking and molecular dynamic (MD) methods were applied to investigative the binding mode involving patchouli alcohol with influenza virus NA protein. We anticipate that the insight into the understanding of inhibiting mechanism will be of value in the rational design of novel anti-influenza drugs."
TA037737_M_0001,"The study utilized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. The cytotoxicity of patchouli alcohol was assessed using the MTT method, where cells were exposed to varying concentrations of the compound, and viability was measured via optical density. The inhibition of influenza A (H2N2) virus replication was similarly evaluated using the MTT method after viral infection. Additionally, time-of-addition experiments were conducted to determine the stage of the viral lifecycle affected by patchouli alcohol, including pretreatment of cells or virus, during adsorption, or post-penetration.","Patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA, purity > 99%) and was stored in glass vials with Teflon sealed caps at −20 ± 0.5 °C in the absence of light. MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) was purchased from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (Harbin, Heilongjiang, China). The cells were grown in monolayer culture with Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The monolayers were removed from their plastic surfaces and serially passaged whenever they became confluent. Cells were plated out onto 96-well culture plates for cytotoxicity and anti-influenza assays, and propagated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The influenza strain A/Leningrad/134/17/1957 H2N2) was purchased from National Control Institute of Veterinary Bioproducts and Pharmaceuticals (Beijing, China). Virus was routinely grown on MDCK cells. The stock cultures were prepared from supernatants of infected cells and stored at −80 °C. The cellular toxicity of patchouli alcohol on MDCK cells was assessed by the MTT method. Briefly, cells were seeded on a microtiter plate in the absence or presence of various concentrations (20 µM – 0.0098 µM) of patchouli alcohol (eight replicates) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 72 h. The supernatants were discarded, washed with PBS twice and MTT reagent (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the supernatants were removed, then 200 μL DMSO was added and incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min. After that the plates were read on an ELISA reader (Thermo Molecular Devices Co., Union City, USA) at 570/630 nm. The mean OD of the cell control wells was assigned a value of 100%. The maximal non-toxic concentration (TD0) and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) were calculated by linear regression analysis of the dose-response curves generated from the data. Inhibition of virus replication was measured by the MTT method. Serial dilution of the treated virus was adsorbed to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. The residual inoculum was discared and infected cells were added with EMEM containing 2% FCS. Each assay was performed in eight replicates. After incubation for 72 h at 37 °C, the cultures were measured by MTT method as described above. The concentration of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir which inhibited virus numbers by 50% (IC50) was determined from dose-response curves. Cells and viruses were incubated with patchouli alcohol at different stages during the viral infection cycle in order to determine the mode of antiviral action. Cells were pretreated with patchouli alcohol before viral infection, viruses were incubated with patchouli alcohol before infection and cells and viruses were incubated together with patchouli alcohol during adsorption or after penetration of the virus into the host cells. Patchouli alcohol was always used at the nontoxic concentration. Cell monolayers were pretreated with patchouli alcohol prior to inoculation with virus by adding patchouli alcohol to the culture medium and incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. The compound was aspirated and cells were washed immediately before the influenza A (H2N2) inoculum was added. For pretreatment virus, Influenza A (H2N2) was incubated in medium containing patchouli alcohol for 1h at room temperature prior to infection of MDCK cells. For analyzing the anti-influenza A (H2N2) inhibition during the adsorption period, the same amount of influenza A (H2N2) was mixed with the drug and added to the cells immediately. After 1 h of adsorption at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed and DMEM supplemented with 2 % FCS were added to the cells. The effect of patchouli alcohol against influenza A (H2N2) was also tested during the replication period by adding it after adsorption, as typical performed in anti-influenza A (H2N2) susceptibility studies. Each assay was run in eight replicates."
TA037737_M_0002,"The in vivo toxicity and antiviral efficacy of patchouli alcohol were evaluated in Kunming mice infected with influenza A (H2N2). Mice were administered patchouli alcohol or oseltamivir, and parameters such as weight loss, mortality, and mean day to death were monitored. For computational analysis, the neuraminidase (NA) protein structure of the influenza virus was obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Patchouli alcohol’s binding interactions with NA were studied using molecular docking and dynamics simulations, with energy calculations and trajectory analysis over 20 nanoseconds to identify key binding residues and mechanisms of inhibition.","Kunming mice, weighing 18–22 g (6 weeks of age) were purchased from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute Animal Co., Ltd. (Harbin, Heilongjiang, China). First, the toxicity of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir was assessed in the healthy mice by the loss of body weight compared with the control group (2% DMSO in physiological saline). The mice were orally administered with 10 mg/kg/dose patchouli alcohol, 2 mg/kg/dose patchouli alcohol or 2 mg/kg/dose oseltamivir (dissolved in 2% DMSO in physiological saline) one time daily for 7 days. The weight of mice was determined daily. We conducted procedures according to Principle of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH Publication No. 85 – 23, revised 1985) and the guidelines of the Peking University Animal Research Committee. Kunming mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and exposed to virus (A/Leningrad/134/17/1957) by intranasal instillation. Drugs were prepared in 2% DMSO in physiological saline and administered 4 h prior to virus exposure and continued daily for 5 days. All mice were observed daily for changes in weight and for any deaths. Parameters for evaluation of antiviral activity included weight loss, reduction in mortality and/or increase in mean day to death (MDD) determined through 15 days. The N2 sub-type neuraminidase crystal structure (PDB code 1IVD) was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. For convenience, the structure is named as NA hereafter. Geometry and partial atomic charges of the patchouli alcohol (Figure 1) were calculated with the Discover 3.0 module (Insight II 2005) by applying the BFGS algorithm and the consistent-valence force-field (CVFF), with a convergence criterion of 0.01 kcal mol−1 Å−1. The docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed by the general protocols in the Insight II 2005 software packages, consistent with the previous literatures. During the MD simulations, the canonical ensemble (NVT) was employed at normal temperature (300 K). The MD temperature was controlled by the velocity scaling thermostat. Integrations of the classical equations of motion were achieved using the Verlet algorithm. The systems were solvated in a large sphere of TIP3P water molecules with the radius of 35.0 Å, which is enough to hold the ensembles. The MD trajectories were generated using a 1.0-fs time step for a total of 20.0 ns, saved at 5.0-ps intervals. The interaction energies of patchouli alcohol with NA and the respective residues at the NA active site were calculated by the Docking module, over the 0.5~20.0 ns MD trajectories. All results are expressed as mean values ± standard deviations (SDs) (n = 3). The significance of difference was calculated by one-way analysis of variance, and values p < 0.001 were considered to be significant."
TA037737_R_0001,"The study investigates the anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity of patchouli alcohol through in vitro, in vivo, and in silico methods. Patchouli alcohol demonstrated low cytotoxicity (CC₅₀ > 20 µM) and effective inhibition of the virus (IC₅₀ = 4.03 ± 0.23 µM), with a selectivity index (SI) > 4.96, indicating its potential as an antiviral agent. Time-dependent experiments revealed its strongest activity during the replication phase, inhibiting viral replication by 97.68% ± 2.09% at 72 hours. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations showed patchouli alcohol binds to neuraminidase (NA) with an interaction energy of -40.38 kcal mol⁻¹, targeting key residues like Asp151, Arg152, Glu119, Glu276, and Tyr406, which are critical for NA function.","In the present study, the anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity of patchouli alcohol was studied in vitro, in vivo and in silico. The CC₅₀ of patchouli alcohol was above 20 µM. Patchouli alcohol could inhibit influenza virus with an IC₅₀ of 4.03 ± 0.23 µM. MTT assay showed that the inhibition by patchouli alcohol appears strongly after penetration of the virus into the cell. In the influenza mouse model, patchouli alcohol showed obvious protection against the viral infection at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Flexible docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that patchouli alcohol was bound to the neuraminidase protein of influenza virus, with an interaction energy of -40.38 kcal mol⁻¹. The invariant key active-site residues Asp151, Arg152, Glu119, Glu276 and Tyr406 played important roles during the binding process. Based on spatial and energetic criteria, patchouli alcohol interfered with the NA functions. Results presented here suggest that patchouli alcohol possesses anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus properties, and therefore is a potential source of anti-influenza agents for the pharmaceutical industry. First the efficacy of patchouli alcohol on influenza A (H2N2) virus replication and cell viability were examined. CC50 was used to express the cytotoxicity of patchouli alcohol on MDCK. The CC50 of patchouli alcohol was above 20 mM, which indicated that patchouli alcohol did not affect the growth of MDCK (Table 1). Thus, it seems that the antiviral effects of patchouli alcohol were not due to the cytotoxicity. Moreover, patchouli alcohol was found to inhibit influenza A (H2N2) virus with an IC50 of 4.03 ± 0.23 µM. Based on the IC50 and CC50 values, the selectivity index (SI) was calculated as >4.96. It is reported that a SI of 4 or more is appropriate for an antiviral agent, suggesting that patchouli alcohol can be judged to have anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity. Until now, it has been found that patchouli alcohol showed dose-dependent anti-influenza virus (A/PR/8/34, H1N1) activity, with an IC50 value of 2.635 µM. Furthermore, it showed weak activity against B/Ibaraki/2/85 (IC50 = 40.82 µM). With the addition of the above H2N2 inhibitory activity, we have a comprehensively view of the anti-influenza activity of patchouli alcohol. Cells were pretreated with patchouli alcohol prior to virus infection (pretreatment cells), viruses were pretreated prior to infection (pretreatment virus), and patchouli alcohol was added during the adsorption period (adsorption) or after penetration of the viruses into cells (replication). Experiments were repeated independently three times and data presented are the average of three experiments. The symbols * indicated very significant difference p < 0.01 with respect to other mode (pretreatment virus, adsorption and pretreatment cell). As shown in Figure 2, patchouli alcohol showed anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity in a time-dependent manner. It showed best antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 8 µM during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 97.68% ± 2.09% for influenza A (H2N2) at 72 h. However, no significant effect was detected when patchouli alcohol was used for pretreatment of cells or viruses or when patchouli alcohol was only added during the adsorption phase. These results suggested that the inhibition of influenza A (H2N2) virus by patchouli alcohol appears to occur much more strongly after penetration of the virus into the cell. Besides, biochemical studies have indicated that the bioactivity of NA protein is essential determinant after the replication of influenza A (H2N2) virus. Hence, we conclude that the function of NA protein may be suppressed by patchouli alcohol."
TA037737_R_0002,"In vivo studies confirmed patchouli alcohol's protective effects against influenza A (H2N2) in mice, with no toxicity observed at tested doses (2–10 mg/kg/day). At 5 mg/kg/day, it significantly delayed mortality (mean day to death: 11.8 ± 1.1) compared to untreated controls. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed stable binding of patchouli alcohol to NA's active site, forming hydrogen bonds with Glu119 and Tyr406 and interacting with residues critical for NA function (e.g., Asp151, Arg152, Glu276). These findings suggest patchouli alcohol disrupts NA activity, supporting its potential as a novel anti-influenza lead compound.","To evaluate the toxicity of patchouli alcohol, the mean value of body weight of mice in each group was statistically analyzed. The mean weights of mice administered at the 2 mg/kg/dose oseltamivir, 2 mg/kg/dose patchouli alcohol and 10 mg/kg/dose of patchouli alcohol one time daily for 7 days were not significantly different compared with the normal control mice, showing no toxicity of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir within the testing concentration (P > 0.05). Physiological status was observed in virus infection mice. Three days after viral infection, some mice, especially mice in the H2N2 infected control group showed changes in behavior, such as a tendency to huddle, diminished vitality, and ruffled fur, etc. In the mouse influenza model, viral infection leads to loss of body weight and high mortality. Therefore, the efficacy of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir were evaluated on the basis of survival rate measured for 15 days post-infection, for treated infected animals relative to untreated infected (control) animals. A comparison of efficacy of patchouli alcohol and oseltamivir in vivo mouse influenza model (oral treatment) showed that at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day, patchouli alcohol showed obvious protection against the influenza virus, as the mean day to death was detected as 11.8 ± 1.1 (Table 2). When the dose was lowered to 1 mg/kg/day, patchouli alcohol showed weaker protection (measured by Survivors/total) than that of 5 mg/kg/day, the mean day to death was 7.5 ± 1.8. Whereas oseltamivir at this dose level (1 mg/kg/day) showed 50% protection (measured by survivors/total) against the influenza virus. In the H2N2 infected control group, there were no survivors. In view of both in vitro and in vivo data, we conclude that patchouli alcohol could be used in the treatment of human influenza virus infections. Based on the above experiment data, patchouli alcohol is determined to be bound within NA protein. As the total energies and backbone root-mean-square-deviations (RMSD) in Figure 3 indicate, the energy-minimized patchouli alcohol-NA complex has been in equilibrium since about 0.5 ns, and then retains quite stable in the last 19.5 ns. It is consistent with the previous MD results of other NA inhibitors. Accordingly, the geometric and energetic analyses were made on the average structures of 0.5~20.0 ns MD trajectories, where the system has been already at equilibrium. The interaction energy (Einter) of patchouli alcohol with NA was calculated at −40.38 kcal mol−1, where the vdW rather than electrostatic interactions were found to play a dominant role, contribute to about 72% (−29.18 kcal mol−1). As shown in Figure 4, the patchouli alcohol was bound at the active site which also bound to oseltamivir and zanamivir. As Figure 5 shows, the oxygen atom of patchouli alcohol was oriented towards the sidechains of residues Glu119 and Tyr406, with one H-bond formed with each residue. The values of distances in Figure 6 further reveal that the docked complex remains rather stable throughout the simulation, with the average distances of Glu119:OE2 — patchouli alcohol:O and Tyr406:OH — patchouli alcohol:O less than 2.8 Å. The sum contributions (Esum) of residues Glu119 and Tyr406 amounted to −8.46 and −7.37 kcal mol−1, respectively (Table 3). Besides, patchouli alcohol was stabilized by residues Arg118, Asp151, Arg152, Trp178, Ala246, Glu276, Arg292, Asn294 and Gln347, especially residues Asp151, Arg152 and Glu276 (Figure 5 and Table 3). As a matter of fact, residues Asp151, Arg152, Glu119, Glu276 and Tyr406 of the NA protein have already received enough attention from rational drug designs. The catalytic residues Asp151, Arg152 and Glu276 are crucial to the NA functions and the residues Glu119 and Tyr406 are important to stabilize the NA active sites. It suggests that the NA functions will be affected by the presence of patchouli alcohol, consistent with the above experiments. Patchouli alcohol matches with the NA active site and has an acceptable interaction energy. Considering the obvious structure discrepancies against current NA inhibitors, it represents an ideal lead compound for the designs of novel anti-influenza agents."

TA040266_I_0001,"Geraniol, a monoterpene with high bioavailability and neuroprotective properties, was investigated for its anticonvulsant effects in vitro using glutamate-injured NGF-induced PC12 cells and in vivo using PTZ-induced kindling in mice, focusing on the GABAergic pathway.","Geraniol (Ger) is a common ingredient of numerous essential oils such as ninde oil, rose oil, palmarosa oil and citronella oil. Ger has a distinguished rose-like odour and taste and is thus extensively utilised as a fragrance material in cosmetic and household products. Pavan et al performed a study to identify Ger’s pharmacokinetics and bioavailability and concluded that Ger has high bioavailability and is able to permeate the central nervous system following its oral administration, reaching detectable amounts in the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ger exhibits various pharmacological properties including antimicrobial, anti-oxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory proposing this monoterpene alcohol as a promising drug candidate. Ger exhibited neuroprotective effects in diverse neurological conditions including spinal cord injury (SCI). Also, Ger improves functional outcomes in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), diminished the neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) and attenuated behavioral and neurochemical impairments in animals exposed single-prolonged-stress (SPS) provoked post-traumatic disorder (PTSD). Also, Ger exerted an antidepressant action in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), protected against rotenone-induced PD.Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder, is a recurrent seizure caused by an abnormal discharge of cerebral neurons. At present, the existing antiepileptic medications have inadequate efficiency and are associated with several their adverse effects that limit their use. Thus, a key objective in epilepsy investigation is to identify new medications with greater efficacy as well as fewer toxicities. The disproportion between excitatory neurotransmitters (Glutamate (Glu)) and inhibitory neurotransmitters (γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)) is a leading element in epilepsy. Multiple studies demonstrated the enhancement of endogenous GABA signaling as well as exogenous GABA delivered to the brain, which could regulate and restore the excitation/inhibition imbalance to prevent seizures in the epileptic brain.GABA signaling includes GABA receptors, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADs) and GABA-transporters (GATs) mainly. Stimulation of GABA receptor leads to the opening of Cl channel, causing Cl− current to enter rapidly, leading to the hyperpolarization consequently preventing the over discharge. GABA receptors are allocated into GABAA, GABAB and GABAC, from which GABAA is utmost closely correlated to epilepsy. GADs, motivate synthesize of GABA, are encoded by two genes, GAD2 (GAD 65) and GAD1 (GAD 67). GATs specifically, GAT 1 and GAT 3 are expressed in nerve terminals and glia to remove GABA from the synaptic cleft.PTZ is regularly utilized to identify the neurobiology associated with epilepsy as well as to estimate the efficiency of novel treatments. Additionally, PC12 cells (pheochromocytoma cells) are generally considered as an in-vitro model for neurological diseases, including epilepsy. PC12 neuron-like cells promoted by nerve growth factor (NGF), which promote neuronal differentiation, and regeneration, are frequently used for examining nerve cell differentiation. Glu mediates excitatory neurotransmission and is involved in neural development and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, NGF-induced PC12 cells injured by Glu were chosen to explore neurological conditions in-vitro, such as epilepsy. NMDAR1, Glu receptor, is closely correlated with epilepsy, and over stimulation of NMDAR receptor is associated with epilepsy pathogenesis.The current study explored the anticonvulsant effect of Ger in-vitro using NGF-prompted PC12 cell injured by Glu and in-vivo using PTZ-induced seizures in mice through considering the GABAergic pathway."

The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of King Faisal University endorsed the study procedure (KFU-REC-2024-JUN-ETHICS1883). Forty Mice were haphazardly clustered into five groups (n = 8). Normal group in which mice were given saline (0.9%). PTZ group in which mice administered PTZ (35 mg/kg, 14 ip injections, every other day). PTZ + Ger 100, PTZ + Ger 200 and PTZ + SV groups in which mice were administered Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) and sodium valproate (SV, 300 mg/kg) orally, respectively, and injected with PTZ. Mice were monitored for half an hour after PTZ injection to evaluate the seizure following Racine score. Mice displayed with stage 5 seizures on two continual PTZ doses were assumed to be entirely kindled and used in the behavioral tests as illustrated in Figure 1. Two-compartment avoidance device was used. The sessions occurred after 1 and 24 h of animals training to evaluate the animals short-term as well as long-term memory. On the behavioral test first day, animals were positioned in the white start compartment. After 5 second, the sliding door was raised to allow mice to go into the darkened chamber. Then, the door was closed for 20s, and the mice were kept there for habituation. After 30 minutes, the acquisition trial was conducted. Each mice was located in the light partition; after 5 s, the door was opened. As soon as the animal entered the dark chamber, the door was locked, and the foot shock (0.5 mA for 2 s) was provided. After twenty second, the mice were located in a temporary cage for attainment training. This test was recurred after two minutes. Mice had a foot shock each time it walked into the dark compartment with all its four paws. When the animal was kept in the light room for two minutes sequentially, the learning training was completed. All the animals learned the task with 2 maximum trials in the control group. On the second day, long-term memory was evaluated by a recovery test. Each mice was positioned in the illuminated compartment for twenty second, subsequently the door was opened, and the step-through latency was documented (up to 400 s) with no electric shocks were delivered to mice throughout that time. Mice suffering from cognitive deficits tends to enter the aversive stimuli zone. Y-maze test appraised the spatial short-term memory in PTZ tested animals as mentioned before in which arms entries no and the unplanned fluctuations were calculated. The device comprised three identical arms (A, B, C) arranged at 120° angles to form a Y-shape. On the last day of the study, 1 hour after different treatment administrations, mice were positioned separately in one of the three starting arms for 8 min for exploration. The number of arms entries and the spontaneous alternations were assessed. Spontaneous alternation is the repeated entrance into the 3 different Y-maze arms in any sequence. The spontaneous alternation percentage was assessed following this equation: . Novel object recognition was applied to appraise mice’s recognition memory as stated before. This test was accomplished using an open field with 40 cm length × 40 cm width × 25 cm high. The day before the last day of the experiment, mice were placed separately in the open field arena for five minutes for place familiarization. After 1 h of the last PTZ dose and for two days, both the acquisition and retention phases were performed. In the retention part, two identical objects (A and A) were offered to each mice for five minutes as an exploration session. Exploration is considered when the animal touches the object or point its nose less than 2 cm towards the object. On the subsequent day, one of the objects that was displayed throughout the acquisition phase was exchanged into a new entity (B) and each mice was permitted to inspect the two items (A+B) for five minutes as the day before. The time needed by each animal to recognize entity A or entity B was noted as tA and tB, respectively. Lastly, discrimination index (DI) was examined . Animals were located in the open field test (dimension: 40 cm length × 40 cm width × 45 cm high; divided into 16 smaller squares of equal (10 cm × 10 cm)) to assess the exploratory behavior, motor coordination, and locomotor ability. One-hour subsequent to the novel object recognition test, animals were submitted to the open field test. The number of lines crossed, rearing, grooming, and the time consumed in the center were documented. The motor coordination was estimated via the rotating rod to conclude the neuroprotective actions of Ger in PTZ administered animals as stated before. One hour after the open field test, each mice was placed on the rotating bar of the rotarod apparatus with a speed of 16 revolutions/minutes for 60 second to evaluate animal stability, which indicates the motor coordination of mice. Subsequent to the behavioral investigations, animals were sacrificed to separate the brains, which were washed with saline. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampus regions were obtained. Four μm hippocampal sections were obtained and stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Hippocampal sections were randomly chosen, photographed, appraised. The morphological changes in the neurons, such as cytoplasmic vacuolation, nuclear chromatin clumping, condensed cytoplasm, and fragmentation of cells, were examined by an independent pathologist to clarify the neuronal damage and scored as follows normal or no injury = 0; rare neuronal injury (< 5 clusters) = 1; occasional neuronal injury (5–15 clusters) = 2; frequent neuronal injury (> 15 clusters) = 3; diffused neuronal injury = 4 as mentioned before. GABA content (μg/g of tissue), GAD and γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) (both expressed as μg/min/mg of tissue) were assessed within the cortex and hippocampus homogenates. Glutathione (GSH, Cat. No. ab239727) content (mol/g of tissue), Catalase (CAT, Cat. No. ab118184) (mmol H2O2/min/g tissue) and superoxide dismutase (SOD, Cat. No. ab285309) activities and Malondialdehyde (MDA, Cat. No. ab238537) level, stated as µmol/g of tissue, were assessed using the specified ELISA kits obtained from Abcam Co., Eugene, OR, USA. In addition, NO, which induces various harmful situations known as nitrosative stress, was assessed using the Griess reagent. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α, Cat. No. ab46070), interleukin-1β (IL-1β, Cat. No. ab100768), interferon-gamma (INF-γ, Cat. No. ab239425), and interleukin-6 (IL-6, Cat. No. ab100772), were calculated consuming specific ELISA kits attained from Abcam Co., USA. GFAP (Cat. No. ab233621), brain astrocyte activation indicator, and BDNF (Cat. No. ab213899) were analyzed using their relevant ELISA kits, which were secured from Abcam Co., USA. The hippocampus obtained from different groups was instantly frozen and stored to be designed for total RNA extraction, as mentioned before. The relative changes in gene expression were accomplished using the 2 - ΔΔCT method. The primers used are as follows GAT-1 (NM_178703.4) F: 5’-GAAAGCTGTCTGATTCT GAGGTG-3’, R: 3’-AGCAAACGAT GATGGAGTCCC-5’; GAT-3 (NM_172890.3) F: 5’- ATTATGTCT CCTGGCGGCCT3’, R: 3’- AAAAGATCTGCGTCCCAGCG-5’; Bcl-2 F: 5’-GTGGATGACTGAGTACC T −3′, R: 5′- CCAGGAGAAATCAAACAGAG −3′, Bax: F: 5’- CTACAGGGTTTCATCCAG −3′, R- 5′- CCA GTTCATCTCCAATTCG −3′; β actin F: 5’-ACGGCCAGGTCATCACTATTG-3’, R: 3’-CAAGAAGGAAG GCTGGAAAAGA. Protein was separated via SDS PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes, which were blocked, washed with TBS, incubated with the primary antibodies (1:2000 dilution) for 2 hours, followed by the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated, 1:5.000 dilution). The chemiluminescence developed from the luminol reagent was detected with the C-DiGit chemiluminescence scanner, and the band intensity was analyzed using the scanner software. Caspase- 3 (Cat. No. ab39401 and caspase 9 (Cat. No. ab65608) were evaluated in hippocampus homogenates using ELISA kits acquired from Abcam Co., USA. Numbers are revealed as mean ± SD. Graph Pad software was utilized to perform one-way ANOVA then Tukey–Kramer as a post hoc test for multiple comparisons using 0.05 level of probability as a significance level."
TA040266_R_0001,"Geraniol (Ger) demonstrated neuroprotective effects in NGF-induced PC12 cells injured by glutamate (Glu), showing no toxicity up to 400 μg/mL. It reduced Glu-induced injury, modulated GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways by increasing GABAA-Rα1, GAD65, and GAD67 expression while decreasing GAT1, GAT3, and NMDAR1. Ger also elevated GABA and 5-HT levels and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, TNF-α).","Ger at different concentrations up to 400 μg/mL did not display any toxicity or injury in PC12 cells as displayed in Figure 2A. Ger diminished the injury induced by Glu from concentrations of 100 to 500 μg/mL, when compared to the model cells (P < 0.001) indicating that Ger had a possible neuroprotective action against the Glu prompted damage in NGF-induced PC12 cells (Figure 2B). In subsequent experiments, the current study focused on these two efficient doses of Ger which are 100 and 200 μg/mL. To scrutinize the shielding action of Ger on NGF prompted PC12 cells damaged by Glu, gene expressions of GABAA-Rα1, NMDAR1, GAD 65, GAT 1, GAT 3 and GAD 67 were identified. The model cells showed elevated gene expressions of NMDAR1, GAT 1, and GAT 3 as well as diminished GABAA-Rα1, GAD 65 and GAD 67 expression (P < 0.001). On the other hand, Ger (100 and 200 μg/mL) considerably amplified GABAA-Rα1, GAD65 and GAD67 and decreased GAT 1, GAT 3 and NMDAR1 expressions relative to the model cells (Figure 2C–H). As revealed in Figure 3, GABA and 5-HT levels were substantially declined (P < 0.001) in model cells. In Ger-treated cells (100 and 200 μg/mL), GABA level was clearly amplified compared with the model cells. As for 5-HT, only Ger (200 μg/mL) instigated significant elevation related to the model cells. IL-1β, IL-4 and TNF-α were augmented in model cells, while Ger (100 and 200 μg/mL) considerably reduced them (P < 0001)."
TA040266_R_0002,"In vivo, Ger ameliorated PTZ-induced kindling in mice, reducing seizure scores and improving memory deficits in passive avoidance and Y maze tests. It restored GABA synthesis (increased GAD, reduced GABA T) and enhanced GAT1/GAT3 expression in the hippocampus and cortex. Ger also mitigated oxidative stress (reduced MDA, NO; increased GSH, SOD, catalase) and neuroinflammation (lowered IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ) while upregulating BDNF and anti-apoptotic markers (Bcl2) and downregulating pro-apoptotic markers (caspase-3/9, Bax). Histological analysis confirmed reduced neuronal degeneration in Ger-treated mice.","No seizures were witnessed in the control group. Kindling (score 5/5) was attained after repetitive PTZ injections (35 mg/kg, 14 ip injections, every other day) showing Racine score of 5. Ger administration (100 or 200 mg/kg) with PTZ injections suppressed the development of kindling considerably (P < 0.001) as established by the reduction in seizure scores in correlation with the PTZ alone (Figure 4A). Repetitive seizures were associated with significant comorbidities, such as, learning and memory insufficiency. Kindling prompted by PTZ (35 mg/kg, 14 ip injections, every other day) drastically declined memory retrieval, which can be assessed by passive avoidance and Y maze tests. In passive avoidance tests, the latency to go in the dark room was considerably reduced in full-kindled animals, whereas Ger administration improved the latency to enter the dark room compared to the PTZ (P < 0.001) (Figure 4B). In the Y maze, kindling induction by PTZ considerably lessened the % of spontaneous alternations, reaching 28.17± 2.64% from 91.5 ± 4.73% in the normal group. Ger and SV increased spontaneous alternations percentage, reaching 38.98 ± 4.45%, 51.18 ± 2.35%, and 61 ± 2.56%, respectively, when related with the PTZ, as illustrated in Figure 4C. Similarly, arms entries escalated from 11.81 ± 1.85 in the PTZ administered animals to 24.73 ± 2.52, 31.06 ± 1.84, and 33.56 ± 1.82 in mice administered Ger and SV, respectively (Figure 4D). These outcomes suggest that Ger modified the memory impairments occurring in PTZ prompted kindling. PTZ amplified the exploration time of the familiar entity and diminished the exploration time of the novel entity as well as DI, as presented in Figure 4E and F. On the other hand, Ger considerably lowered the exploration time of the familiar entity and augmented the time of the novel entity and DI (Figure 4G). PTZ amplified the number of rearing and reduced the number of crossing and grooming and the center time in the open field, as depicted in Figure 4H and K. Whereas Ger-administered mice showed lowered number of rearing as well as increased number of crossings, grooming, and the center time in the open field. In addition, the period consumed on the rotating bar was considerably diminished in the PTZ-administered animals. An effect that was inverted by Ger and SV (Figure 4L). As GAD is one of the chief regulators in GABA synthesis and GAT-1 and GAT-3 are responsible for the regulation of extracellular GABA levels. Therefore, in the current study, GABA, GAD and GABA T were evaluated in hippocampus and cortex as well as GAT 1 and GAT 3 gene and protein expression were measured (Figure 5). In PTZ induced kindled animals, GABA and GAD were suppressed reaching a reduction percentage of 61.30% and 64.13% for GABA and in 70% and 62.97% for GAD in both hippocampus and cortex, respectively, whereas GABA T was increased in both hippocampus and cortex. These outcomes indicate that PTZ is associated with lowered GABA synthesis and availability in synapse. On the contrary, Ger significantly restored GABA level and GAD activity and lowered GABA T in both hippocampus and cortex as presented in Figure 5. Additionally, PTZ induced kindled animals, GAT 1 and 3 gene and protein expression were suppressed, whereas Ger significantly increased GAT 1 and 3 gene and protein expression as presented in Figure 6. PTZ induced a considerable escalation in the MDA level. However, management with Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) lessened MDA when linked with PTZ-group (Figure 7A and B). Likewise, NO levels were extensively amplified in PTZ. However, Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) and SV exhibited a substantial reduction in NO, causing a % reduction of 22.6%, 51.78%, and 60% in the hippocampus and 20.65%, 42.63% and 57.8% in the cortex, respectively (Figure 7C and D). Oral administration of Ger reversed the GSH insufficiency produced by PTZ, as illustrated in Figure 7E and F. PTZ produced a % decline of 66.45% and 60.9% in GSH in hippocampus and cortex respectively. Whereas Ger (100 and 200mg) amplified GSH in the hippocampus and cortex, when compared to PTZ. In the same way, PTZ prompted a % deficiency in the SOD and catalase activities in the hippocampus and cortex when compared with normal animals, while Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) augmented SOD catalase activities (Figure 7). PTZ alone administered to mice experienced a boost in IL-1ß. However, Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) exhibited an attenuation in IL-1β, attaining a percentage decline of 12.70% and 32.3% in the hippocampus and 21.47% and 34.53% in the cortex, respectively (Figure 8). Whereas Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) administration significantly lowered IL-6 levels. In the same way, TNF-α level was augmented by PTZ application alone when compared to the normal animals. PTZ administered mice that were treated with Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) exhibited a percentage decline of 20.49% and 36.92% (P < 0.001) in the hippocampus and 14.97%, and 37.53% (P < 0.05) in cortex, respectively, when related with PTZ alone group. Alike, PTZ animals displayed an elevation in IFN-γ in the hippocampus from 116.03 ± 7.67 pg/mL in normal group to 307.08 ± 11.9 pg/mL in PTZ given mice and in the cortex from 101.54 ± 8.57 pg/mL in normal animals to 281.75 ± 8.46 pg/mL in the PTZ group. On the other hand, Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) exhibited a percentage decline of 18.55% and 40.31% (P < 0.001) in the hippocampus and 19.54%, and 39.56% (P < 0.001) in cortex, respectively. GFAP and BDNF levels were presented in Figure 9A and B. PTZ- group exposed a noteworthy upsurge in GFAP levels, indicating astrocyte triggering, and a diminishing in BDNF protein levels. On the contrary, Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) administration significantly lowered GFAP by 16.63% and 30.54%, respectively, and increased BDNF levels by 46.55% and 86.02%, respectively, in the hippocampus. PTZ increased caspase-3 and −9 levels and Bax gene expression and diminished Bcl2 gene expression (Figure 9). Alternatively, Ger (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly reduced caspase-3 and −9 levels and Bax gene expression and escalated Bcl2 gene expression. The hippocampal CA1 region in PTZ kindling mice displayed fragmented, contracted, and pyknotic neurons complemented with perineuronal edema, which presented apparent regular hippocampal layers. Ger-administered animals exhibited inferior neural degenerative as well as intercellular edema with a decline in the scoring when compared to the PTZ group (Figure 10)."
TA040266_D_0001,"The study investigates the anticonvulsant effects of Geraniol (Ger) through in vitro and in vivo models, focusing on the GABAergic pathway. Ger demonstrated neuroprotective effects in NGF-induced PC12 cells injured by glutamate (Glu) by modulating GABA-related gene expressions and reducing neuroinflammation. In vivo, Ger ameliorated PTZ-induced seizures, oxidative stress, and memory impairment in mice.","Several plant extracts that contain Ger were assessed for anticonvulsant activity such as Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt (Poaceae) leaf essential oil and Ocimum basilicum leaf essential oil, hydro-alcoholic extract of R. damascena and Cymbopogon citratus Stapf leaves essential oil and hydroalcoholic extract in zebra fish. However, robust is known about the anticonvulsant effect of Ger alone. Therefore, the current study tried to scrutinize the antiepileptic effect of Ger using both in-vitro via NGF-prompted PC12 cell injured by Glu and in-vivo models via PTZ-induced seizures in mice through with regard to the GABAergic pathway.The neuron-like PC12 cell is extensively utilized to develop neuroprotective agents and identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. Ger reduced the injury induced by Glu, indicating that Ger had a possible defensive action in Glu prompted injury in PC12 cells. The next step was to explore GABA signaling pathway. In brain tissues, the GABA accessibility is synchronized by GABA synthesizing glutamate decarboxylases (GAD65 and GAD67) activity, the GABA degrading GABA aminotransferase (GABAT), and the GABA transport proteins (GAT1–3 and BGT-1). Loss-of-function mutations in GABAAR genes are an essential mechanism in the pathophysiology of familial idiopathic generalized epilepsy. GABAAR α-subunit changes play a significant role in the process of epileptogenesis. GAT 1 and GAT 3, as GATs, are expressed in nerve terminals and glia to remove GABA from the synaptic cleft in the brain, and lack of expression of GATs would enhance the ability of GABA to spread through the extracellular space. In PTZ-induced kindling was associated with an upregulated gene expression of GAT-1 and GAT-3 indicating that PTZ might affect GABA homeostasis by regulating the GABA transporters. GAD65−/− mice develop spontaneous seizures associated with increased mortality, whereas GAD67−/− mice showed a 93% reduction in GABA concentration in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, clinical confirmations further showed that lowered GAD activity is associated with several forms of epilepsy.The results showed Ger (100 and 200 μg/mL) amplified the gene expressions of GABAA-Rα1, GAD65 and GAD67 and decreased GAT 1, GAT 3 and NMDAR1 expression in NGF prompted PC12 cells damaged by Glu. Additionally, GABA and 5-HT levels were increased in Ger-treated cells (100 and 200 μg/mL). These outcomes signify that Ger escalates the GABA signaling pathway, which is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter.Regarding inflammatory mediators, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-1β contents were increased in NGF prompted PC12 cells damaged by Glu whereas Ger reduced these inflammatory cytokines by demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effect."
TA040266_D_0002,"Geraniol (Ger) showed protective effects against PTZ-induced seizures, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in mice. It improved memory and motor functions, modulated GABAergic neurotransmission, and exhibited antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. The study highlights Ger's potential as an anticonvulsant agent but notes limitations such as the lack of pharmacokinetic data.","The in-vitro outcomes achieved displayed that PTZ chronic administration caused a intense alteration of memory. These effects are in line with preceding outcomes that disclosed that PTZ induced kindling in mice disturbs short-term as well as long-term memory. The Y-maze and the novel object recognition task are extensively applied to recognize the implication of diverse brain areas in cognitive abilities. The passive avoidance test estimates the capability of the animal to learn and to maintain an associative rule. In the current study, Ger increased the percentage of spontaneous alternations suggesting that it may protect mice from memory impairment. Also, Ger mitigated PTZ prompted spatial and recognition memory deficiency signifying anti-amnesic effects of Ger in epileptic animals. Moreover, the outcomes of the open field and rotarod tests propose that locomotion, exploratory behavior and motor coordination are enhanced by Ger in PTZ kindled mice. Earlier studies showed that Ger abated SPS-induced locomotor and memory diminishing, as well as behavioral despair in SPS-induced PTSD. Also, Ger improved passive avoidance memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits in Alzheimer’s disease and enriched neuronal construction and spatial memory in D-galactose (D-gal) generated cognitive diminishing.In the current study, Ger diminished PTZ induced escalations in GABA-transaminase activity and reductions GABA, GAD and GABA receptor in hippocampus and cortex. These effects advocate that Ger has anticonvulsant, antiepileptogenic, as well as anti-amnesic properties via affecting GABAergic pathway.Formerly, Ger increased DA, 5-HT concentrations and GAD enzyme activity in SPS-induced PTSD. Also, Ger showed antipruritic abilities of on acute and chronic itch via modifying spinal GABA/GRPR signaling. A prior study investigated the neuroprotective actions of C. citratus essential oil and hydroalcoholic extract, as well as of its correlated ingredients citral and geraniol in PTZ provoked seizures in zebrafish. The increase in the latency time for the first seizure, was reduced when zebrafish were pretreated with Flumazenil, signifying the contribution of GABAA receptor in the anticonvulsant actions of Ger in zebrafish.Oxidative stress is another contributor in the pathogenesis of seizures. The existing study exposed that PTZ persuaded oxidative stress, manifested as provoked MDA and NO levels and reduced GSH level, and CAT and SOD activities. Whereas Ger inhibited NO and lipid peroxidation as well as increased GSH level, CAT and SOD activities, proposing that Ger protected brain cells against the destructive actions of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Previous studies revealed that Ger exhibited antioxidant effects through which it exerted neuroprotective potential in the cerebral I/R injury, acrylamide, and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, Ger efficiently amended aging-related memory weakening through intensifying GSH, BDNF, Ach levels, and SOD activity in D-gal prompted cognitive diminishing.Another participant involved in the epilepsy pathophysiology is the neuroinflammatory response to epileptogenic insults. PTZ-induced kindling triggered neuroinflammatory response causing an elevation in the brain cytokines. Remarkably, Ger prevented the escalation in brain cytokines prompted by PTZ implying that Ger exerts anti-inflammatory properties in epileptic mice. Previous reports revealed that Ger exhibited anti-inflammatory against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammation, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) instigated in liver fibrosis, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis. As for neurological actions, Ger exhibited anti-inflammatory potential against SPS-induced PTSD. Prior studies revealed the molecular mechanisms of the potent anti-inflammatory effect of Ger. For instance, Ger protected against traumatic SCI by downregulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways in SCI rats. A another study demonstrated that in Ox-LDL-stimulated HUVECs, Ger suppressed the nuclear translocation and activity of NF-ᴋB as well as phosphorylation of IkBα. Also, Ger effectively reduces the expression of COX-2, mPGES-1 (produces PGE2), PTGDS (produces PGD2) and MMP-1 expressions in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory arthritis (IA) in rats.Both oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory are associated with apoptosis. In the current, Ger reduced caspase-3, and −9 levels and Bax gene expression and escalated Bcl2 gene expression, indicating deterring PTZ associated apoptosis. Similarly, Ger relieved LPS-induced acute lung damage via deterring lung inflammation and apoptosis. Also, Ger defended against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in liver I/R damage.In the existing study, SV was administered as a positive control in PTZ kindling-induced seizures. SV associated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and neuronal damage-preventing effects in mice were due to its ability in preventing seizures and subsequent lower neuronal damage and therefore lesser oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis occurring in the animals’ brains. On the other hand, valproic acid alone can be used to induce brain damage and autism-like symptoms in animals, and in zebra fish.The limitations of the current study include the lack of pharmacokinetics and bioavailability experiments for Ger in the CNS and the absence of cell death-specific assays such as TUNEL assay."

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Geraniol (Ger), a monoterpene, is a common constituent of several essential oils. This study explored the anticonvulsant effect of Ger in-vitro using nerve growth factor (NGF) prompted PC12 cell injured by Glutamate (Glu) and in-vivo using Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling through the GABAergic pathway. MATERIALS: To assess the effect of Ger on NGF prompted PC12 cells injured by Glu, Ger at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 μg/mL was used. GABA, 5-HT, IL-1β, IL-4, and TNF-α levels and the gene expressions of GABAA-Rα1, NMDAR1, GAD 65, GAD 67, GAT 1 and GAT 3 were measured in NGF-induced PC12 cells treated with Ger (100, and 200 μg/mL). Mice were randomly separated into five groups. Normal and PTZ groups in which mice were injected with saline or PTZ, respectively. PTZ + Ger 100, PTZ + Ger 200 and PTZ + SV groups in which mice orally administered Ger or sodium valproate (SV), respectively, then injected with PTZ. RESULTS: Ger up to 400 μg/mL did not display any toxicity or injury in PC12 cells. Ger (100 to 200 μg/mL) reduced the injury induced by Glu, increased the gene expression of GABAA-Rα1, GAD65 and GAD67 and decreased GAT 1, GAT 3 and NMDAR1 expression in NGF-induced PC12 cells damaged by Glu. Ger (100 to 200 μg/mL) increased GABA and reduced TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-1β levels in NGF-induced PC12 cells injured by Glu. As for the in-vivo results, Ger increased GABA, GAD, GAT 1 and 3 and lowered GABA T. Ger mitigated MDA, NO, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ, GFAP, caspase-3, and -9 levels and Bax gene expression and escalated GSH, SOD, catalase, BDNF and Bcl2 gene expression. CONCLUSION: Ger reduced the oxidative stress status, neuroinflammation and apoptosis and activated GABAergic neurotransmission, which might clarify its anticonvulsant. Ger protects animals against PTZ prompted kindling as established by the enhancement in short term as well as long-term memory. Ger mitigated the injury induced by Glu in NGF prompted PC12 cell."

TA039874_I_0001,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon with unclear etiology, involving genetic, immune, and environmental factors, and is characterized by intestinal barrier dysfunction and systemic symptoms.","Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic non-specific inflammatory disease of the colorectum of unknown etiology, mostly located in the sigmoid colon and rectum, with lesions generally confined to the mucosal and submucosal layers. The occurrence of UC may be due to genetic predisposition, immune dysfunction, intestinal microecological dysregulation, and altered environmental factors, among others. In the 21st century, UC has become one of the major challenges in global public health. In Europe and North America, the number of patients exceeds 1.5 million and 2 million, respectively, and the prevalence in regions such as Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa is continuously increasing. Patients with UC tend to present with intestinal reactions with varying degrees of systemic symptoms, particularly disturbed bowel habits, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and mucopurulent bloody stools. Although abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in stools are not life-threatening complications perse, they are associated with decreased quality of life, and the ensuing damage to the colonic mucosal barrier, and imbalance of intestinal flora are much more serious problems. The mucosal epithelium, as a natural protective barrier of the intestinal tract, not only regulates the selective permeability of the intestinal epithelial cells for material transport, but also prevents pathogenic antigens in the intestinal lumen, such as endotoxin, viruses, bacteria, and their metabolites, from entering into the intrinsic layer of the mucosa. When the intestinal tract is under an inflammatory state, the intestinal epithelial barrier will lose the normal transport and defense function, and harmful substances continuously enter the internal environment of the intestine, leading to excessive activation of the immune response, further damaging the intestinal barrier, and ultimately resulting in a series of inflammatory manifestations both inside and outside the intestine. Based on the development of disease understanding, the current therapeutic goal for UC has changed from controlling inflammation and relieving clinical symptoms to promoting intestinal mucosal repair, a great goal that not only reduces the use of hormonal drugs and surgical treatments but also dramatically improves the long-term prognosis and enhances the quality of patients’ lives."
TA039874_I_0002,"The dysregulation of the intestinal mucosal barrier in UC involves multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, TCF-4, MAPK, and Notch, with conflicting reports on PI3K/AKT activity in colitis, highlighting the need for further research and potential inhibitors like Astragaloside IV (AS-IV).","As above mentioned, dysregulation of the intestinal mucosal barrier is an important feature of UC disease, and this phenomenon is usually attributed to protein kinase B (AKT1), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), transcription factor 4 (TCF-4), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and so on. AKT is a protein kinase B with serine and threonine kinase activity, and its role is mainly related to the information linkage activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) initiation. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regulates the activation of inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators and has a clear intervention role in UC immune inflammation. NF-κB is an important intracellular nuclear transcription factor that participates in the body’s inflammatory response, and immune response, and regulates apoptotic and stress response. Christian F et al. found that the NF-κB signaling pathway in UC and colitis-associated colon cancer mice models was increased, which will lead to pathological changes in the UC intestine and trigger positive feedback for further NF-κB activation and exacerbated inflammation. The Wnt pathway plays a crucial role in the intestinal epithelium, especially in regulating the behavior, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of stem cells. Reduced Wnt pathway, especially the specific defect in TCF-4 expression induces deficiencies in Paneth cell defensins, which is one of the major factors in the pathogenesis of UC. The Notch signaling pathway is involved in the differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells and promotes the expression of tight junction proteins. The aberrant activation of the Notch pathway induces an increase in the expression of the HES1 transcription factor in human colon cell lines, thereby inhibiting the differentiation of the secretory cell lineage and weakening the mucus barrier. In addition, it also promotes inflammatory responses and accelerates the disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier through activation of macrophage activation. It is worth noting that in the above UC-related signaling pathway, we found that there are some important discrepancies seen in studies about the PI3K/AKT signal pathway. Firstly, while most studies suggest that PI3K/AKT signaling becomes overactive under colitis conditions, a few studies report reduced activities of PI3K/AKT in colitis animals. Secondly, it is in the preliminary research stage about clinically administrable chemical inhibitors and/or agonists for PI3K/ AKT at present. Thus, there is an urgent need to elucidate and validate the real function of the PI3K/AKT1 signal pathway in IBD."
TA039874_I_0003,"Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a terpenoid from Astragalus membranaceus, exhibits barrier-protective effects in various diseases by modulating the PI3K/AKT pathway, prompting investigation into its role in DSS-induced colitis and intestinal barrier repair.","Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is a terpenoid extracted from Astragalus membranaceus, which is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine therapy and health care for its various pharmacological effects such as immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant, anti-tumor, and hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that AS-IV is extensively involved in the barrier function regulation of various diseases and the regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. AS-IV has been reported to have a significant protective effect on human glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) by inhibiting AKT activation and increasing GSK activation in the form of GSK3α, which promotes glucose uptake in GEnCs and enhances energy metabolism to participate in the protection of the filtration barrier in GEnCs. AS-IV prevents tight junctions (TJs) disruption and intestinal barrier damage by inhibiting activation of RhoA/NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle signaling in an in vivo cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis model and an in vitro Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed Caco-2 monolayer barrier model. AS-IV promotes the phosphorylation level of AKT, inhibits GSK-3β activity, leads to nuclear translocation and accumulation of β-catenin, improves cell viability, and promotes the expression of TJ proteins and wound healing to alleviate Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)-associated intestinal dysfunction. Given that AS-IV plays an important role in the repair of barrier function in vivo, we sought to explore the potential impact of the administration of AS-IV on barrier function in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice, and whether PI3K/AKT plays a role in it. In this study about UC, we worked to investigate the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in intestinal inflammation, and the pharmacological activities of AS-IV such as anti-inflammatory and the repair of the intestinal epithelium. Simultaneously, we explored whether AS-IV acts as a potential ligand of PI3K/AKT. Finally, the potential microbial-dependent mechanism of AS-IV was also probed."
TA039874_M_0001,"The study employed a variety of techniques to investigate the therapeutic effects of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) on ulcerative colitis (UC). These included immunofluorescence staining to assess mucosal barrier function, colonoscopy to observe intestinal inflammation, and histopathological staining to evaluate tissue damage. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine ultrastructural changes in the intestinal epithelium. ELISA, qRT-PCR, and western blotting were utilized to measure cytokine levels, gene expression, and protein phosphorylation, respectively. Molecular docking and network pharmacology were applied to predict the interaction between AS-IV and the PI3K/AKT pathway. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to analyze gut microbiota composition.","The intestinal tissues from UC patients and colitis mice were collected, intestinal inflammation was observed by colonoscopy, and mucosal barrier function was measured by immunofluorescence staining. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activator YS-49 and inhibitor LY-29 were administered to colitic mice to uncover the effect of this pathway on gut mucosal barrier modulation. Then, network pharmacology was used to screen Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a core active component of the traditional Chinese medicine Astragalus membranaceus. The potential of AS-IV for intestinal barrier function repairment and UC treatment through blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway was further confirmed by histopathological staining, FITC-dextran, transmission electron microscopy, ELISA, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and western blotting. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to uncover whether AS-IV can ameliorate UC by regulating gut microbiota homeostasis."
TA039874_M_0002,"Animal experiments were conducted to establish UC models using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Disease activity index (DAI) was scored based on body weight, diarrhea, and blood in stool. FITC-dextran assay and small animal imaging were used to assess intestinal permeability. Caco-2 cells were cultured to simulate intestinal epithelial barrier function, and cell viability was measured using a CCK-8 assay. These methods were applied to evaluate the protective effects of AS-IV on intestinal barrier integrity and inflammation.","The animal experiments in this study were divided into three parts: In the first part, mice were divided into two groups: control and DSS groups. The control group was given normal drinking water and the DSS group was given drinking water containing 2.5%DSS for 7 d. In the second part, mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, DSS, LY29, and YS49 groups. Drinking water containing 2.5%DSS was provided to the DSS and LY29 groups for 7 d, and the other two groups were given normal drinking water. During the period, LY29(5 mg/kg) and YS49(5 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally once into the LY29 or YS49 group every day respectively. In the third part, mice were divided into 4 groups: control, DSS, AS-IV treatment, and 5-ASA treatment groups. Except for the control group mice were provided with normal drinking water, the other groups of mice were given 2.5% DSS drinking water for 7 d. Mice in all groups were given normal drinking water from day 8 to day 10. All group mice gavage therapy was administered once a day from day 0 to 10. Mice in the AS-IV and 5-ASA treatment groups were gavaged 100 mg/kg AS-IV and 150 mg/kg 5-ASA respectively, and the control group and DSS group were gavaged 0.5% CMC-Na solution (solvent for AS-IV and 5-ASA). Each group of the three-part animal experiments contained 10 mice. We defined the starting point of the animal experiment as day 0 and recorded the weight and stool of the untreated mice. After the molding was done, all mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (ip, 50 mg/kg) before sampling. Body weight, diarrhea, and blood in stool were recorded at the same time each day during the modeling process, and the disease activity index (DAI) was scored. At the end of the modeling period, feces and blood were collected from the mice. The colon was photographed and recorded, collected 1 cm from the end of the anus, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, the remaining tissue was stored at -80 °C for RNA and protein extraction. Anesthetized mice with 1% pentobarbital sodium (ip, 50 mg/kg). Colonoscopy with a high-resolution mouse video endoscopic system (KARL STORZ, Tuttlingen, Germany) was used to inflate the colon with air and observe on mice’s colon. After the animal model was completed, 3 mice were fetched randomly in each group. Every mouse was gavaged FITC-Dextran (40 mg/kg) after 8 h of fasting, and the abdomen was exposed carefully after 6 h to observe the distribution of FITC-Dextran in intestinal tissues using a small animal imaging system (Boloteng, Guangzhou, China). Meanwhile, the serum was separated to detect the fluorescence intensity after collecting the blood, and the concentration of FITC-Dextran in the serum was calculated by plotting a standard curve according to the instructions. The human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) is similar in structure and function to differentiated small intestinal epithelial cells, with microvilli and enzymes associated with small intestinal brush epithelium, and can be used to simulate intestinal transport in vivo. Caco-2 cells from ATCC/LGC Standards GmbH (HTB-37, Wesel, Germany) were cultured with MEM medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 cell culture incubator. AS-IV was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for treatment of Caco-2 cells and the final concentration of DMSO was kept less than 0.1% (v/v). Caco-2 cells (1×104 cells) were inoculated in 96-well plates and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to confluent, followed by stimulation with LPS (100 µg/ml) and AS-IV (150 µM) for 24 h. Then 10 µl/well CCK-8 (Yeasen Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h further. Finally, absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)."

Subsequently, sections were incubated with anti-mouse IgG (Alexa Fluor® 488 Conjugate) and anti-rat IgG (Cy3 Conjugate) in the dark at room temperature for 60 min, followed by incubation with 30 µL DAPI for 10 min. Finally, sections were observed using a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan). RNA was extracted from colon tissue and Caco-2 cells by TRIzol, and reverse transcription (Takara, Japan) and real-time PCR (Vayme, China) were performed according to the instructions of the kit. All primer sequences were synthesized by Sangon Biothen Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and the primer sequences are shown in Table S1. All qRT-PCR analyses were carried out with a 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).

The relative fold change in expression was finally calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method. All samples were assayed in triplicate and expression levels of mRNA were normalized using the endogenous control β-actin. Intestinal tissues and cells were collected and fully lysed with the pre-cooled RIPA mixture + 1% PMSF + 1% phosphatase inhibitor. The supernatant was collected with centrifugation. Protein concentration was then determined using BCA quantification (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany), and heated at 100 °C for 10 min added 5x loading buffer. After being separated by electrophoresis using a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Then, the PVDF membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder for 2 h at room temperature, and incubated with specific primary antibodies against EpCAM, Occludin, AKT1, p-AKT1(Ser473), PI3K, and p-PI3K (Tyr458) and secondary antibodies at 4 °C.

TA039874_M_0004,Molecular docking was performed to predict the binding affinity of AS-IV to AKT1. Network pharmacology and PPI network analysis were used to identify core targets of AS-IV in UC treatment. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were conducted to explore the biological pathways modulated by AS-IV. These computational methods provided insights into the molecular interactions and signaling pathways involved in AS-IV's therapeutic effects.,"AKT1 protein complex PDB file (PDB ID: 7NH5) from RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/), the potential active site residues are obtained from the site finder module of the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software and protein plus (https://proteins.plus/). This operation establishes the structure-function relationship of the predicted AKT1 protein complex and identifies potential binding regions of antagonists or agonists. AS-IV (Compound CID: 13,943,297), Formononetin (Compound CID: 5,280,378), and Kaempferol (Compound CID: 5,280,863) structure information is from the PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). For the optimization of receptor and ligand molecules, hydrogenation and energy minimization are performed using MOE software. The DOCK module in MOE software is used for molecular docking, and the docking method is Induced Fi. To eliminate false positive results, we restricted the docking score of AS-IV and AKT1 to less than − 5.0 kcal/mol. Pymol was used to further display the docking results and analyze the interactions. Relevant targets of AS-IV were collected from Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP, http://tcmspw.com/ tcmsp.php/) and Swiss target prediction databases (http://www.Swisstargetprediction.ch/) based on oral bioavailability (OB) ≥ 30% and drug-likeness (DL) ≥ 0.18. The Gene Cards database (https://www.genecards.org/) and Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org/) were used to search for UC-related target genes. Then, all the selected targets were imported into Cytoscape software to establish the active drug and disease target networks. To find the core targets for AS-IV intervention in UC, the STRING database (https://string-db.org/) was used to establish a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of active drugs and common targets of diseases. The obtained data were imported into Venn diagram webtool (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) and Cytoscape software to be analyzed and screened for possible core targets (the higher the degree indicates that the target is more important in this PPI network).

TA039874_R_0001,"The study investigates the therapeutic potential of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) in ulcerative colitis (UC) by targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to improve intestinal epithelial barrier function. UC patients and DSS-induced colitis mice showed disrupted intestinal barrier integrity, evidenced by reduced expression of tight junction proteins (Villin, ZO-1, Occludin) and increased permeability. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway worsened colitis, while its inhibition improved barrier function. Network pharmacology identified AS-IV as a potent AKT1 inhibitor, supported by molecular docking and enrichment analyses. AS-IV treatment alleviated inflammation, restored barrier proteins, and modulated gut microbiota, suggesting its dual role in UC therapy.","The patients who were diagnosed with acute stage UC and had diarrhea, pain, and bloody stools were selected as study subjects. Colon mucosal congestion, edema with erosion, ulceration, bleeding spots on the intestinal mucosa, and the ulcer surface with white moss were observed under the colonoscope (the colon mucosa of healthy objects is smooth, with a clear vascular texture, and there is no erosion, ulceration, or bleeding) (Fig. 1A). Surgical resected colon tissues were collected from the subjects, and the intestinal barrier function was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Results showed that the expression of Villin, ZO-1, and Occludin, classical TJs-related proteins, on the inflamed colonic tissues was significantly decreased compared with that in normal control (Fig. 1B-C), indicating that gut barrier integrity is disrupted in the inflamed colonic tissues in UC patients. We wonder whether this phenomenon also exists in the murine colitis model. Therefore, C57BL/6 mice were fed with 2.5% DSS solution, and body weights, DAI scores, colon lengths, and colonoscope intestinal luminal manifestations were recorded and evaluated in conjunction with pathologic scores for the successful construction of a mouse model of colitis (Fig. 1D-J). Considering increased intestinal permeability is the main manifestation of mucosal barrier disruption and one of the basic features of UC, FITC-Dextran was orally administered to the colitic mice, and fluorescence intensity was detected in colonic tissues and sera. As shown in Fig. 1K, FITC-Dextran was widely distributed throughout the intestinal tissues up to the anus in the colitic mice as compared with the control mice. In addition, obvious rupture of the TJs structure of the epithelial cells and atrophy of the villi of the intestinal wall were observed under transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1L). Consistently, the immunofluorescence results showed a significant reduction in the expression of intestinal TJs proteins Villin, ZO-1, and Occludin (Fig. 1M-N). These data collectively demonstrated that gut barrier integrity is disrupted and intestinal permeability is increased in the inflamed colonic tissues of UC patients and UC mice."
TA039874_R_0002,"The PI3K/AKT pathway's role in UC was confirmed using activator YS-49 and inhibitor LY29, showing that pathway activation exacerbates barrier damage while inhibition ameliorates it. AS-IV, identified as a high-affinity AKT1 inhibitor via molecular docking, demonstrated anti-inflammatory and barrier-restorative effects in DSS-induced colitis mice and LPS-treated Caco-2 cells. Network pharmacology and enrichment analyses linked AS-IV to the PI3K/AKT pathway and UC-related biological processes. AS-IV treatment reduced proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α), restored tight junction proteins, and improved gut microbiota diversity, particularly enriching beneficial taxa like Akkermansia and Ruminococcaceae.","As above mentioned, various signaling pathways have been reported to be extensively involved in UC occurrence and progression, and the PI3K/AKT axis participates in regulating the barrier function of various tissues in the human body, especially in intestinal barrier regulation. Whereas the conclusions are often contradictory, the real role and the detailed mechanisms of the PI3K/AKT axis in UC are still largely unknown. To clarify the effects of PI3K/AKT on UC, the activator YS49 is administered to normal mice, and the inhibitor LY29 is administered to DSS-induced colitis mice (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B-F, YS-49 alone significantly reduced body weight (Fig. 2B), elevated DAI (Fig. 2C), shortened colon tissues (Fig. 2D-E), and increased intestinal permeability (Fig. 2F) of the C57BL/6 mice as compared with the control mice (P < 0.05), although not so significantly changed as DSS-treated mice (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001). Notably, LY29 remarkably inhibited DSS-induced colitis in mice as indicated by the recovered weight loss, colon length, DAI, and gut mucosa barrier. These data suggested that PI3K/AKT signal pathway activation damages intestinal barrier integrity and aggravates UC in mice. Then, we further confirmed this effect in intestinal epithelial-derived Caco-2 cells. Results showed that LPS stimulation greatly accelerated TJ disruption between Caco-2 cells via suppressing the expressions of ZO-1 and Occludin, which was potently restored in the presence of LY29 (Fig. 2G-H), indicating PI3K/AKT axis activation is essential for intestinal barrier damage. Considering PI3K/AKT might be a potential target for UC treatment, molecular docking modeling was used to screen 'AKT1 inhibitors' from dozens of compounds extracted from traditional Chinese medicine. Among them, AS-IV, kaempferol, and formononetin were found to have a relatively high affinity to AKT1. AS-IV is the most binding compound, the calculated binding energy is -12.596 kcal/mol, and four covalent bonds (Glu191, Lys276, Glu278, and Asp292) are possibly formed to tightly bind to AKT1 (Fig. 3A). Although we reported previously that AS-IV ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in mice via promoting macrophages M2 polarization, the direct target and detailed mechanism of AS-IV is almost completely unknown. Therefore, network pharmacology was used to explore the complex mechanisms of AS-IV in UC. The TCMSP and Swiss target prediction databases were utilized to collect targets corresponding to AS-IV, and a total of 28 drug targets were obtained (Fig. 3B). Disease targets were screened using the Gene Cards database, and the relevance of the targets to the disease was evaluated by relevance score, where we screened a total of 4917 disease targets with relevance. Then the Venny data visualization tool was used to screen the drug-disease co-targets and draw Venny plots, and a total of 14 potential drug-disease combination targets were obtained (Fig. 3C-D). To further analyze the core targets of AS-IV in UC, the relevant data were imported into the STRING database and Cytoscape software to establish and analyze the PPI network, and the centrality of the nodes was analyzed by betweenness centrality (BC), closeness centrality (CC), and degree centrality (DC), and 11 meaningful targets were filtered out (Fig. 3E-F). Among them, AKT1 is the target gene with the highest number of nodes. Then KEGG and GO enrichment analysis of the above common targets was performed using the David database. Suggesting that AS-IV is involved in many biological processes in UC (Fig. 3G), including positive regulation of protein kinase B signaling and positive regulation of cell proliferation, the regulation of cellular components mainly focuses on the cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleoplasm, and also plays a role by regulating molecular functions such as ATP binding, identical protein binding, and protein kinase activity. KEGG signaling pathway analysis showed that AS-IV was associated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, proteoglycans and pathways in cancer, chemical carcinogenesis-receptor activation, endocrine resistance, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was also highly correlated (Fig. 3H). PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (p-value = 1.40E-04, gene count = 6) was the most widely studied in UC and AKT1 was the key hub with the highest node degree in the PPI network. Combined with the above results and related literature hints, AS-IV may play a role in UC by regulating the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT."
TA039874_R_0003,"AS-IV treatment in DSS-induced colitis mice and LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects, including reduced weight loss, lower disease activity index (DAI), and improved histopathology. AS-IV restored intestinal permeability, mucus production, and tight junction protein expression (Occludin, ZO-1, Claudins) while suppressing PI3K/AKT phosphorylation. Gut microbiota analysis revealed AS-IV's ability to enhance microbial diversity, reduce pathogenic Escherichia-Shigella, and promote beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia, Ruminococcaceae), further supporting its therapeutic potential in UC via dual mechanisms of barrier repair and microbiota modulation.","As shown in Fig. 4A-C, E-H, the colitis mice after AS-IV intervention had less weight loss, lower DAI and pathology scores, and attenuated colonic length shortening as compared with the model mice. Meanwhile, the treatment of 5-ASA, which is identified as the routine medicine for IBD, was considered as the positive control. The AS-IV group showed smoother intestinal wall mucosa, improved congestion, and edema, and no obvious ulceration and bleeding spots compared to the DSS group under colonoscopy (Fig. 4D). In addition, both the mRNA and protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were significantly suppressed in colon tissues and sera (Fig. 4I-J). The effects of AS-IV on UC were further identified in an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) inflammation model established by treating Caco-2 cells with LPS. As shown in Fig. 4 K, LPS stimulation significantly inhibited IEC viability, which was potently reversed in the presence of AS-IV. In addition, LPS induced strong proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and TNF-α transcription (Fig. 3L) and expression (Fig. 3M) in IEC, while AS-IV treatment greatly suppressed this effect. Thus, AS-IV plays an anti-inflammation role in the murine colitis model. Subsequently, we assessed the effects of AS-IV on the intestinal permeability and mucosal barrier function in each group of the mice, results showed that the colons were significantly less permeable to FITC-Dextran after AS-IV intervention (Fig. 5A-B), and the disruption of the intestinal villi was alleviated under the transmission electron microscope, which was more neatly and densely arranged and tightly connected structures (Fig. 5C). AB-PAS staining was then performed on the colonic tissues of the mice, and results showed that AS-IV was able to alleviate the erosion of intestinal epithelium, crypt damage, and loss of mucus-secreting goblet cells induced by DSS (Fig. 5D-E). When the mRNA level of the TJs barrier-associated genes such as Occludin, Muc2, ZO-1, Villin, Claudin-2, Claudin-5, and Claudin-7 in the inflamed colonic tissues was detected by qRT-PCR, we found that the negative TJs regulatory gene Claudin-2 was suppressed, whereas the other positive TJs regulatory genes were significantly upregulated by AS-IV (Fig. 5F). In addition, immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate mucosal barrier TJs in the colon. Results showed that the expression of Villin, Occludin, and ZO-1 were all increased in the AS-IV group (Fig. 5G-H). These aforementioned data collectively suggested that AS-IV ameliorated murine colitis by improving the intestinal mucosa barrier function. Similar data were obtained in Caco-2 cells in which LPS stimulated significantly decreased, whereas AS-IV intervention increased the production of intestinal mucosa barrier-associated genes (Fig. 5I). Thus, AS-IV can directly regulate IEC-mediated gut barrier maintenance in the colitic mice. Although we predicted that AS-IV may directly target the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, it is still unknown whether AS-IV regulated intestinal barrier function via this AKT molecule, and how about the effect of AS-IV on AKT activation. To clarify these problems, we detected the levels of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT1, and p-AKT1 in colitis mice, and results showed that DSS stimulation strongly induced PI3K/AKT activation as indicated by the elevated phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT1. However, AS-IV significantly inhibited this effect (Fig. 6A-B). In addition, both the TJs-associated Occludin and adhesion junction-associated EpCAM were reversely changed (Fig. 6C-D), suggesting that AS-IV regulates the intestinal barrier via blocking PI3K/AKT activation. To confirm this, Caco-2 cells were treated as indicated and immunofluorescence was carried out to detect the changes of ZO-1 and Occludin, we found that LPS greatly inhibited ZO-1 and Occludin expression on Caco-2 cells, which can be restored by AS-IV. However, this effect of AS-IV was almost completely shielded by the PI3K/AKT activator YS-49 as exhibited by the downregulated ZO-1 and Occludin production (Fig. 6E-F). Therefore, we concluded that AS-IV regulates intestinal barrier maintenance in colitis via inhibiting PI3K/AKT activation. Based on the therapeutic effect of AS-IV on colitis, we wonder whether AS-IV can regulate IECs and gut microbiota simultaneously as both of them play pivotal roles in colitis-associated inflammation and intestinal barrier disruption. Therefore, we analyzed the fecal samples by 16 S rRNA identification in the V3-V4 region, and the results showed that the bacterial species richness and diversity in feces in the AS-IV–-treated group were significantly increased compared to the control. The depth of sequencing of the OTUs of the Venny diagram covered all common species in the samples, and the overlap of the four groups represented the common OTUs, totaling 375, and group-specific OTUs of 203, 148, 250, and 116, respectively (Fig. 7A). In ecology, α diversity is commonly used to measure the diversity of intra-individuals. By analyzing α diversity associated with OTU levels, such as Chao1, ACE, and Shannon indices, gut microbial was significantly reduced in the DSS group. However, the α diversity of the fecal microbial community in the AS-IV groups was restored after treatment with pharmacological interventions (Fig. 7B-D). Abundances of the taxa in all taxonomic ranks in each sample were used to construct sample-similarity matrices by the Bray-Curtis algorithm and analyzed the relative similarity of microbiota composition between groups according to non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). As shown in Fig. 7E-F, the results of NMDS and PCoA showed that there were differences in microbial profiles among the four groups, with a relatively large distance between the control and DSS groups as indicated by a more unique microbiota composition, especially in terms of principal component 2 (PCoA2). Based on the results of the above analyses, we continued to investigate the microbial population composition at the phylum level, and most of the samples exhibited high levels of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia at the phylum level. DSS intervention significantly down-regulated the proportion of Bacteroidetes and increased the proportion of proteobacteria in the intestinal flora. However, the increase in the proportion of firmicutes was accompanied by a down-regulation of the proportion of proteobacteria in the AS-IV group (Fig. 7G). At the genus level, we observed ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (secreting butyrate), Escherichia-Shigella (producing the inflammatory factor IL-1β), Alloprevotella (producing short-chain fatty acids), and Akkermansia (the most promising next-generation probiotics) are as the dominant bacteria. Escherichia-Shigella was increased by DSS but recovered after AS-IV treatment. In addition, the content of ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Alloprevotella, and Akkermansia was significantly increased in the AS-IV group (Fig. 7H). It is known that Akkermansia is effective in increasing mucus thickness and strengthening intestinal barrier function. The above results suggested that AS-IV plays a role in regulating the mucosal barrier by interfering with gut microflora homeostasis."
TA039874_D_0001,"The study investigates the therapeutic potential of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) in ulcerative colitis (UC) by targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to improve intestinal epithelial barrier function. UC pathogenesis involves intestinal barrier dysfunction, and current treatments have significant side effects. AS-IV, derived from Astragalus root, shows promise in alleviating colitis by inhibiting PI3K/AKT activation, reducing inflammation, and restoring barrier integrity. The study employs in vivo and in vitro models, network pharmacology, and 16S rRNA sequencing to validate AS-IV's effects on mucosal barrier repair and gut microbiota homeostasis.","The elimination of intestinal inflammation is a complex biological process, involving multiple stages such as the repair of damaged intestinal mucosa and the regeneration of intestinal epithelial cells, and finally the termination of inflammation and the return of tissue homeostasis. At present, the conventional treatment of UC mainly includes aminosalicylic acid, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants, but these drugs are often accompanied by serious adverse effects and can even be life-threatening. It is worth noting that as one of the main active ingredients of Astragalus, AS-IV can exert biological effects by regulating the activity of proteins, thus inhibiting the overactivation of the immune response in vivo. We demonstrated that the expression of intestinal mucosal epithelial TJs in UC patients and colitic mice was significantly decreased accompanied by an over-activated PI3K/AKT axis. However, AS-IV was able to effectively reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, promote the expression of TJs barrier proteins, and ameliorate the damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier to alleviate murine colitis to a great extent. Meanwhile, 16 S rRNA sequencing showed that AS-IV significantly improved the intestinal flora disorders in colitic mice by increasing the proportion of Firmicutes decreasing the proportion of Proteobacteria, and significantly increasing the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria such as AKK. As the most promising next-generation probiotic, AKK can regulate glucose and lipid metabolism as well as mucus secretion, and limited studies have shown that AKK has the function of monitoring and regulating immune homeostasis and can alleviate inflammation in IEC by down-regulating PI3K/AKT expression. These data collectively suggested that inhibiting the activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is a potential mechanism of AS-IV in UC treatment."
TA039874_D_0002,"The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway's role in UC is explored, highlighting its activation leading to inflammation and mucosal damage. AS-IV's inhibition of this pathway reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines and restores barrier function. The study also discusses the limitations of using Caco-2 cells instead of primary intestinal epithelial cells and the absence of AKT1 mutant mice, proposing future research directions to address these gaps.","As a lipid kinase located near the inner layer of the plasma membrane, PI3K has Ser/Thr and phosphatidylinositol kinase activity. It is composed of a regulatory subunit, p85, and a catalytic subunit, p110, with the catalytic subunit having auto-suppressor properties, leading to near inactivation of the enzyme in the resting state. Upon activation, PI3K will phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). AKT is a subgroup of the Ser/Thr kinase family of AGC proteins that are a central node for cell signaling downstream of growth factors, cytokines, and other cellular stimuli. It can be activated with the help of the PI3K downstream effector phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). The activating of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway can induce NF-κB, LPS, and TNF-α-mediated pro-inflammatory and apoptotic signals by enhancing the phosphorylation of IκB (mainly IκBα) and reducing the synthesis of IκB, leading to the imbalance of cytokine secretion and enlarging the inflammatory chain reaction. Eventually, inflammation and intestinal mucosal damage persist. American cockroach extracts Ento-A effectively increased the expression levels of IL-4 and forkhead transcription factor protein 3 (Foxp3) while decreasing the expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-17 in splenic lymphocytes, inhibited the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway, and ameliorated UC symptoms. Hany et al. revealed that dapagliflozin exerts ameliorative effects on experimental colitis by inhibiting the HMGB1/RAGE/NF-κB cascade through activation of the AMPK/mTOR and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways, augmenting colon autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis. Our study and the above literature have firmly supported that activated PI3K/AKT1 can lead to damage of intestinal mucosa by increasing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, we have reason to think that the inhibition of PI3KAKT1 might be beneficial for the treatment of UC because it is more critical for the healing of mucosa to decrease the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The latter has been demonstrated to be a main factor directly causing mucosal damage. Intestinal mucosal barriers mainly include mechanical, microbial, immune, and chemical barriers, we mainly studied the mechanical and microbial barriers in this study. Our group previously reported that AS-IV can effectively inhibit pro-inflammatory macrophages and promote alternative macrophage polarization to improve the immune barrier of colitis by regulating the STAT signaling pathway. These two studies provided a more comprehensive theoretical basis for the clinical research and application of AS-IV. However, there are some shortcomings in this study. First of all, the use of Caco-2 cells as an in vitro intestinal barrier model instead of primary intestinal epithelial cells is a limitation. Currently, in vitro culture and processing of primary intestinal epithelial cells is still relatively difficult. Normally, organ cells gather together and adhere tightly to the extracellular matrix, and form a self-executing “home” that depends on the nutrient supply of growth factors for their function and survival. However, disturbance of the extracellular matrix or lacking growth factors usually leads to programmed cell death of IEC, thus greatly limiting the culture of intestinal epithelial primary cells in vitro. Secondly, genetically modified mice with mutant AKT1 which maintains its kinase activity but loses the AS-IV binding sites were not introduced is another limitation of this study. In future studies, we will attempt to be able to isolate and culture primary IECs from mouse intestines, obtain intestinal organoids, and build AKT1 mutant transgenic mice for in-depth exploration."
TA039874_C_0001,"The study investigates the therapeutic potential of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) in ulcerative colitis (UC) by targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to improve intestinal barrier function. UC's pathogenesis involves intestinal barrier defects, and AS-IV, derived from Astragalus root, shows promise in repairing this barrier. Methods include tissue analysis, pharmacological interventions, and microbiome sequencing to confirm AS-IV's efficacy.","Title: Blockade of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by Astragaloside IV attenuates ulcerative colitis via improving the intestinal epithelial barrier. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The specific pathogenesis of UC is still unclear, but it has been clear that defects in intestinal barrier function play an important role in it. There is a temporary lack of specific drugs for clinical treatment. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is one of the main active ingredients extracted from Astragalus root and is a common Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. This study aimed to determine whether AS-IV has therapeutic value for DSS or LPS-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in vivo and in vitro and its potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The intestinal tissues from UC patients and colitis mice were collected, intestinal inflammation was observed by colonoscopy, and mucosal barrier function was measured by immunofluorescence staining. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activator YS-49 and inhibitor LY-29 were administered to colitic mice to uncover the effect of this pathway on gut mucosal barrier modulation. Then, network pharmacology was used to screen Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a core active component of the traditional Chinese medicine Astragalus membranaceus. The potential of AS-IV for intestinal barrier function repairment and UC treatment through blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway was further confirmed by histopathological staining, FITC-dextran, transmission electron microscopy, ELISA, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and western blotting. Finally, 16 S rRNA sequencing was performed to uncover whether AS-IV can ameliorate UC by regulating gut microbiota homeostasis."
TA039874_C_0002,"Results demonstrate that AS-IV significantly alleviates inflammation and enhances intestinal barrier integrity by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway. Microbiome analysis reveals AS-IV's role in restoring gut microbiota balance. The study concludes that AS-IV, as a novel AKT inhibitor, offers a promising therapeutic approach for UC by targeting mucosal barrier repair and inflammation reduction.","RESULTS: Mucosal barrier function was significantly damaged in UC patients and murine colitis, and the activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was extensively involved. Both in vivo and vitro showed that the AS-IV-treated group significantly relieved inflammation and improved intestinal epithelial permeability by inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In addition, microbiome data found that gut microbiota participates in AS-IV-mediated intestinal barrier recovery as well. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that AS-IV exerts a protective effect on the integrality of the mucosal barrier in UC based on the PI3K/AKT pathway, and AS-IV may serve as a novel AKT inhibitor to provide a potential therapy for UC. Discussion: In summary, we report here that AS-IV reduces inflammation and repairs the mucosal barrier of UC at least partially by blocking the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that PI3K/AKT is a promising candidate target in UC therapy and provides new insights regarding the therapeutic potential of AS-IV for UC treatment, which has important research significance and clinical value.

TA043851_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the importance of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) in tea plants, emphasizing their role in stress adaptation and aroma quality, and identifies gaps in understanding the epigenetic regulation of volatile biosynthesis genes.","Herbivore infestations are an important selection pressure for plants because they lead to the evolution of protective secondary metabolites. In response to insects or their eggs, some plants can synthesize and release volatile metabolites into the air. These complex herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) consist of diverse volatile organic compounds, including alkenes, alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers, esters, and carboxylic acids. These stress-induced volatile metabolites help plants cope with adverse environmental stresses in a variety of ways, and they can also influence crop aroma quality. For example, the aroma of tea (Camellia sinensis), a cash crop widely cultivated in China, is essential to the sensory evaluation and commercial value of tea. Tea plants are under various stresses during the pre-harvest growth period and post-harvest processing, resulting in the induction of accumulation of volatile metabolites, thereby enhancing aroma quality. Specifically, herbivore stress is one of the important aroma-inducing factors. A typical example of using herbivores to enhance the aroma of tea leaves is the noted oolong tea, Oriental Beauty Tea. Oriental Beauty Tea has a unique honey fruit fragrance, and is processed from fresh tea leaves infested by tea green leafhoppers (Empoasca onukii). To date, studies on HIPVs in tea plants have mostly focused on metabolite and transcript levels. For example, several studies on the effects of piercing–sucking insects (e.g. tea green leafhopper) and chewing insects (e.g. tea geometrid) on tea plants revealed that many volatile fatty acid derivatives, volatile phenylpropane/phenyl compounds, and volatile terpenes are produced and released after an infestation. The subsequent transcriptome-level research demonstrated that herbivore infestations activate the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway and some secondary metabolite synthesis pathways in a process that may be primarily regulated by transcription factors or protein kinases. Some stress-induced volatile synthase genes in tea plants have been cloned and analyzed to verify the functions of the encoded enzymes. Examples include the methyl salicylic acid carboxymethyltransferase gene CsSAMT, the JA carboxyl methyltransferase gene CsJMT, the β-ocimene synthase gene CsOS2, the (S)-linalool synthase genes CsLIS1 and CsLIS2, the indole synthetase genes CsTSA and CsTSB2, the (E)-nerolidol synthase gene CsNES, and the α-farnesene synthase gene CsAFS. However, the mechanism underlying the herbivore-induced expression of these genes remains unclear."
TA043851_I_0002,"The introduction discusses the role of endogenous and exogenous factors, including jasmonic acid (JA) and epigenetic regulation, in inducing volatile metabolite production in plants, with a focus on (E)-nerolidol and its significance in tea aroma and plant defense.","Both endogenous (developmental) and exogenous environmental factors (biotic and abiotic stresses) induce the production of volatile metabolites in plants. For instance, upregulation of sesquiterpene synthesis genes in Arabidopsis floral organs correlates with flower development. Moreover, wounding and low-temperature stress induced the expression of the indole synthesis gene CsTSB2 in tea leaves, resulting in the accumulation of indole. In addition to endogenous developmental factors and exogenous environmental factors, the plant hormone JA also has an essential role in the production of plant volatile metabolites. When tea leaves were treated with JA, the indole synthesis gene CsTSB2 was significantly induced, and the corresponding volatile metabolite indole accumulated. JA regulates downstream gene expression and metabolite responses, such as accumulation of volatile indole, mainly through the signaling pathway transcription factor MYC2. Moreover, epigenetic regulation has also been reported to be associated with volatile metabolite production in tea. Under continuous wounding stress, H3K9Me2 and DNA methylation levels in the promoter region of CsTSB2 decreased, thereby promoting CsTSB2 expression, resulting in increased indole content. Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms mainly include histone modification, nucleosome remodeling, DNA methylation, non-coding RNA and histone variants, which regulate the temporal and spatial expression of specific genes at the transcriptional level. However, there are still relatively few reports describing the correlation between the accumulation of volatile metabolites in tea and epigenetic regulation. It is also unclear whether histone acetylation is related to the production of volatile metabolites in tea. (E)-Nerolidol is an important compound that influences tea aromas, while also participating in plant resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Regarding its effect on food quality, (E)-nerolidol is a volatile compound with a floral fragrance; it is present in tea at a relatively high concentration, especially in oolong tea. Thus, (E)-nerolidol is considered to be a crucial aromatic component of high-quality oolong tea. Additionally, (E)-nerolidol is an important biologically active compound with pharmacological properties (e.g. antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-ulcer, skin penetration enhancement, antitumor, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties). In plants, (E)-nerolidol and its derivative 4,8-dimethylnonyl-1,3,7-triene play a key role in responses to infestations by phytophagous insects. Recent studies on tea plants revealed that (E)-nerolidol is a signaling substance that prompts defense of tea plants against pathogens and insects and helps mediate responses to cold stress and plant–plant communication induced by cold stress. However, it is unclear how herbivore infestations induce (E)-nerolidol accumulation."
TA043851_I_0003,"The introduction concludes by outlining the study's focus on the role of histone deacetylase CsHDA2 and its interaction with CsMYC2 in regulating (E)-nerolidol accumulation under tea green leafhopper infestation, highlighting the epigenetic mechanisms involved.","In this study, an examination of tea leaves treated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors indicated that HDACs may be related to the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol in tea plants following tea green leafhopper infestation. Correlation analyses and the identification of interacting proteins suggested that CsHDA2 and CsMYC2 may be important for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by tea green leafhoppers. Furthermore, we observed that the production of CsHDA2 and its binding to the CsNES promoter decreased after a tea green leafhopper infestation, and this enhanced the H4 acetylation of the CsNES promoter region. This was followed by the activation of CsNES and an increase in (E)-nerolidol content. The results of this study clarify the effect of histone acetylations on the accumulation of HIPVs and identified CsHDA2–CsMYC2 as an important transcriptional regulatory module for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by a tea green leafhopper infestation."
TA043851_M_0001,"The study utilized a comprehensive set of methods to investigate the epigenetic regulation of (E)-nerolidol formation in tea plants under tea green leafhopper infestation. Key techniques included plant material treatment with herbivores, jasmonic acid, and histone deacetylase inhibitors, followed by volatile compound analysis. Molecular biology methods such as RNA extraction, qPCR, protein analysis, and subcellular localization were employed. Interaction studies between CsHDA2 and CsMYC2 were conducted using yeast two-hybrid, co-IP, and EMSA. Epigenetic modifications were analyzed via ChIP, while transcriptome sequencing provided gene expression data. Statistical methods ensured data reliability.","The tea cultivar used in this study was C. sinensis ‘Jinxuan’ and all the tea samples (one bud and three leaves) were collected from the Yingde tea field, China (23°N, 113°E). All treated tea samples were placed in an incubator (temperature 25°C, relative humidity 80%, light intensity 6500 lux, and 16 hours light/8 hours dark). Every replicate contained 10 tea shoots, and each treatment group had three biological repeats. Tea green leafhoppers (Empoasca onukii Matsuda, fifth instar) were collected from the Yingde tea field, China (23°N, 113°E). The tea branches and tea green leafhoppers were collected in November 2019. Each replicate consisted of 10 tea shoots, which were cultivated in a plastic bottle, the opening of which was sealed with gauze. Then, 10 tea shoots in a bottle were treated with 40 tea green leafhoppers. Subsequently, the bottles were positioned in an incubator for 48 and 96 hours. Tea branches without infestation by tea green leafhoppers incubated in an identical situation were used as the control. Owing to the uncertainty of the infestation of tea green leafhoppers in tea, in order to achieve a better treatment effect, the treatment time for the infestation of tea green leafhoppers was relatively long. Tea branches (plucked in September 2020) were soaked in 2.5 mM JA solution (containing 1% ethanol for solubilization) for 24 hours. Tea branches treated with 1% ethanol–water (v/v) solution and incubated in an identical situation served as the control. Tea branches (plucked in June 2018) were independently soaked in HDAC inhibitor mixed solution [containing 0.25 mM sodium butyrate, 0.25 mM SBHA (suberohydroxamic acid), 0.25 mM TSA and 0.25 mM nicotinamide; dissolved in 5% ethanol] for 24 hours. Tea branches treated with 5% ethanol–water (v/v) solution and incubated in an identical situation served as the control. Dichloromethane was used to extract tea samples and ethyl decanoate was used as an internal standard. After extraction, the samples were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis using a QP2010 SE (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The quantitative analysis of (E)-nerolidol depended on the calibration curve of the standard. Total RNA was extracted with a Quick Plant Total RNA Kit (Huayueyang Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the PrimeScript® RT (TAKARA, Dalian) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instruments (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and SYBR Green Mix fluorescent dye reagent (Bio-Rad, USA) were used for qRT–PCR. The internal reference gene was CsEF1-α (GenBank no. KA280301.1). The 2-ΔΔCt method was used to analyze the relative expression levels of genes. Tea samples with or without tea green leafhopper infestation were harvested for total protein extraction. The sample powder was fully homogenized with vegetable protein extraction buffer (Fude, China), then boiled and separated on Smart PAGE™ precast gels using MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) running buffer (Smart-Lifescience, China). Anti-Actin (Abbkine, USA) and anti-CsHDA2 (Huaan, China) antibodies were used as primary antibodies, and appropriate goat secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (Abbkine, USA) were used for detection. The gray-scale intensity of protein bands in western blots was analyzed by Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, USA). The open reading frame (ORF) of CsHDA2 was cloned into pSAT6–EYFP vector. Mesophyll protoplasts were obtained from Arabidopsis leaves and were enzymatically hydrolyzed in the enzyme solution at room temperature for 5 hours. The constructed vector CsHDA2–YFP (10 μg) was instantaneously transformed into Arabidopsis protoplasts by PEG4000. The protoplasts were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) after incubation at 22°C for 16 hours. The primers for subcellular vector construction are presented in Supplementary Data Table S1. The constructed vector 35S:CsHDA2–GFP was transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101-pSoup. The empty vector 35S:GFP was used as an internal control. A single colony was cultured in LB liquid medium (containing 50 μg/mL rifampicin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin) and shaken at 28°C overnight. Then, the Agrobacterium cells were collected and resuspended in suspension containing 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES, and 150 μM acetosyringone to adjust the OD600 to 1.0–1.2. Then, the resuspension was stood at room temperature for 2 hours. A disposable syringe was used to inject the Agrobacterium liquid into the epidermis of 4-week-old tobacco leaves. After incubation for at least 48 hours, the tobacco leaves were collected and stored at −80°C. The enzymatic determination method of HDAC was as described in a previous study. The purified protein was collected from tobacco leaves that transiently expressed 35S:CsHDA2–GFP or 35S:GFP. Enzyme activity was determined using an HDAC enzyme activity colorimetric assay kit (K331-100, BioVision) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For studying the transcriptional activation of CsMYC2 to CsNES promoter, the primers were designed with reference to the promoter sequence of CsNES (XM_028232453.1) based on the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The primers for vector construction are presented in Supplementary Data Table S1. The promoter was cloned into the pGreenII 0800–LUC dual reporter vector, and the constructed pHB–CsMYC2–FLAG plasmid was used as an effector. The Agrobacterium strain GV3101-pSoup was used to transiently co-transfer the CsNES-reporter plasmid and CsMYC2-effector plasmid into tobacco leaves. After 2 days of incubation, a dual-luciferase reporter kit (Promega) and microplate reader (Tecan Infinite F50, Tecan Austria) were used to determine the activity of LUC and REN luciferases. The ratio of LUC to REN reflects the final transcription activity. The full-length ORFs of tea genes CsHDA2, CsHDA8, and CsMYC2 were amplified separately and were cloned into pGADT7 or pGBKT7 vectors with MonClone™ Hi-Fusion Cloning Mix (catalog no. RN06004M, Monad). The paired AD and BD construct vectors were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109 by the lithium acetate method, and yeast cells were cultured on Minimal Media Double Dropouts (SD/−Leu/−Trp) at 28°C for 2 days to screen out single colonies of yeast successfully co-transformed. Then, the transformed colonies were transferred onto Minimal Media Quadruple Dropouts (SD/−Leu/−Trp/−Ade/−His) to verify whether CsHDA2/CsHDA8 and CsMYC2 interact. 3-Amino-1, 2, 4-triazole (3-AT) was added to the Minimal Media Quadruple Dropouts to repress background growth. The primers for yeast two-hybrid vector construction are presented in Supplementary Data Table S1. The constructed pEAQ–CsMYC2–GFP and pHB–CsHDA2–FLAG vectors were respectively transferred into Agrobacterium GV3101-pSoup and Agrobacterium co-infected 4-week-old tobacco. After 48 hours of culture, the tobacco leaf materials were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen. Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 2 mM PMSF, 0.05 mM MG132) was used to extract tobacco protein. The protein supernatant obtained was added with anti-GFP magarose beads (Smart-Lifesciences, China) and incubated at 4°C for 2 hours. The beads were washed twice with washing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 2 mM PMSF) and were collected. The immunoprecipitated proteins were tested by western blotting with anti-GFP (Abbkine, USA) and anti-FLAG antibody (TransGen, Beijing, China). The ChIP analysis was investigated using the reported method with little modifications. The tea samples were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde solution under vacuum for 0.5 hours. Using sonication (Scientz, 92-IID), chromatin was dissociated and cut to an average length close to 500 bp, followed by immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, such as anti-acetyl-histone H3 (06-599, Millipore), anti-acetyl-histone H4 (06-866, Millipore), anti-CsHDA2 (Huaan, China), anti-CsMYC2 (Huaan, China), and anti-normal rabbit IgG (12–370, Millipore). The cross-linking was then reversed, and the DNA was extracted and purified with a Zymo Research Kit (D4013). The amount of each immunoprecipitated DNA fragment was determined by quantitative PCR using the gene-specific primers in Supplementary Data Table S1. The ORFs of CsHDA2 were cloned into expression vector pGEX4T-3 and transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3). BL21 (DE3) cells were incubated at 37°C for 1.5–2 hours to OD600 = 0.6. To obtain recombinant GST-tagged protein, IPTG (isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside) was mixed in the cultures, which were incubated at 37°C for another 4 hours. Then, to obtain recombinant GST-tagged protein, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 × PBS buffer (2.7 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10 mM Na2HPO4). The supernatant was collected and tested by western blot analysis with anti-GST (Abbkine, USA) and anti-CsHDA2 (Huaan, China) antibody. The coding sequence of CsMYC2 and CsHDA2 was cloned into the pGEX4T-3 vector to yield the GST–CsMYC2 and GST–CsHDA2 fusion proteins, and the plasmids obtained were transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells to induce fusion proteins. In addition, empty pGEX4T-3 vectors were transformed to obtain GST tags used as control. Proteins (including GST tag, GST–CsMYC2, and GST–CsHDA2) were induced by adding IPTG and purified using glutathione beads (Smart-Lifesciences, China). Probe sequences of CsMYC2 (5′-CTACTTTCATGTGATTCTATGTTCAACTCTCCCAAGCAACATACTTACGAAAATTTTCTTGCCATTTGACAAAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTTTGTCAAATGGCAAGAAAATTTTCGTAAGTATGTTGCTTGGGAGAGTTGAACATAGAATCACATGAAAGTAG-3′) were synthesized and labeled (3′-end) with biotin. EMSA was carried out using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Quick Plant Total RNA Kit (Huayueyang Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was used to extract total RNA. Sequencing libraries with 250-bp fragments were constructed using the Illumina Novseq platform with PE150 according to the standard Illumina procedure. Each sample contained three replicates. Data analysis was provided by Bio&Data Biotechnologies Inc. (Guangzhou, China). Briefly, transcriptome raw reads were preprocessed by Fastp v.0.20.1 with default parameters for the purpose of adaptor trimming and removal of low-quality RNA-seq reads (Phred quality scores <20). Clean reads were mapped to a tea reference genome (http://tpdb.shengxin.ren/Blast.html) for further analysis. Gene expression levels were calculated using the fragments per kilobase per million reads (FPKM) method, and DEGs were defined based on the following criteria: a DESeq2-adjusted false discovery rate <0.01 and fold change >2 compared with the control samples. In addition, genes were annotated with eggNOG 5.0. The Benjamini–Hochberg test was performed to detect statistically significant enrichment of the KEGG pathway. Two peptides (amino acids 288–301 and 335–348) for CsMYC2 and two peptides (amino acids 15–28 and 205–218) for CsHDA2 were chemically prepared and used to immunize rabbits to obtain antibodies (Hangzhou HuaAn Biotechnology Company, Hangzhou, China). Student’s t-test was used to test whether there were any differences between the treatments. All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. P ≤ .05 and P ≤ 0.01 were considered as significant and extremely significant, respectively. Accession numbers are as follows: CsHDA2 (XM_028266230.1), CsHDA5 (XM_028270527.1), CsHDA6 (XM_028198649.1), CsHDA8 (XM_028230298.1), CsHDA9 (XM_028254491.1), CsHDA14 (XM_028256101.1), CsHDA15 (XM_028254911.1), CsHDA19–1 (XM_028208382.1), CsHDA19–2 (XM_028226874.1), CsHDT1–1 (XM_028241623.1), CsHDT1–2 (XM_028223731.1), CsSRT1–1 (XM_028252771.1), CsSRT1–2 (XM_028259997.1), CsSRT2 (XM_028196821.1), CsMYC2 (XM_028207058.1), CsEF1-α (KA280301.1), and CsNES (XM_028232453.1)."
TA043851_R_0001,"The study investigates the role of histone deacetylase CsHDA2 in regulating (E)-nerolidol formation in tea plants (Camellia sinensis) under tea green leafhopper infestation. It explores the connection between herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), jasmonic acid (JA) signaling, and epigenetic regulation. The results show that tea green leafhopper infestation, JA treatment, and histone deacetylase inhibitors all increase (E)-nerolidol content and upregulate the expression of the biosynthesis gene CsNES. Additionally, CsHDA2 interacts with the JA-related transcription factor CsMYC2, and its expression is inhibited during infestation, leading to increased histone acetylation in the CsNES promoter region.","Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) help the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) adapt to environmental stress, and they are also quality-related components of tea. However, the upstream mechanism regulating the herbivore-induced expression of volatile biosynthesis genes is unclear, especially at the level of epigenetic regulation. In this study, similar to the effects of a tea green leafhopper infestation, treatments with exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and histone deacetylase inhibitors significantly increased the (E)-nerolidol content in tea and induced the expression of the associated biosynthesis gene CsNES. Furthermore, a key transcription factor related to JA signaling, myelocytomatosis 2 (CsMYC2), interacted with histone deacetylase 2 (CsHDA2) in vitro and in vivo. A tea green leafhopper infestation inhibited CsHDA2 expression and decreased CsHDA2 abundance. Moreover, the tea green leafhopper infestation increased H3 and H4 acetylation levels in the promoter region of CsNES, which in turn upregulated the expression of CsNES and increased the (E)-nerolidol content. In this study, we revealed the effects of histone acetylations on the accumulation of HIPVs, while also confirming that CsHDA2-CsMYC2 is an important transcriptional regulatory module for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by tea green leafhoppers. The results of this study may be useful for characterizing plant aromatic compounds and the main upstream stress-responsive signaling molecules. Furthermore, the study findings will assist researchers clarify the epigenetic regulation influencing plant secondary metabolism in response to external stress."
TA043851_R_0002,"The study demonstrates that tea green leafhopper infestation significantly increases (E)-nerolidol content and CsNES gene expression in tea plants. JA treatment and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors produce similar effects, suggesting a link between JA signaling and epigenetic regulation. Among 14 HDAC genes analyzed, CsHDA2 and CsHDA8 were downregulated during infestation, while CsHDA6 and CsSRT1-2 were upregulated. CsHDA2 was confirmed as a nuclear protein with HDAC activity, and its interaction with CsMYC2 was validated through yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Additionally, CsMYC2 was found to activate CsNES promoter activity, and its binding to the CsNES promoter increased during infestation, while CsHDA2 binding decreased. Histone acetylation levels (H3 and H4) in the CsNES promoter region also increased, correlating with elevated CsNES expression.","To explore the effects of a tea green leafhopper infestation on the (E)-nerolidol content, infestation of tea green leafhoppers on tea plants was simulated in an indoor environment (Fig. 1a). At 48 and 96 hours post-infestation, the (E)-nerolidol content was significantly elevated in the infested tea leaves in comparison with the control (Fig. 1b). The subsequent determination of the expression level of the (E)-nerolidol synthase gene, CsNES, indicated that it increased following infestation by tea green leafhoppers (Fig. 1b). The JA pathway is one of the most important signaling pathways for inducing HIPV production in plants. Because MYC2 is an essential transcription factor involved in the JA signaling pathway, we investigated the effect of tea green leafhoppers on MYC2 expression in tea leaves. Infestation by tea green leafhoppers significantly induced CsMYC2 expression (Fig. 1b). Thus, tea green leafhopper infestation promoted the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol and JA as well as the expression of related genes. (E)-Nerolidol is a volatile secondary metabolite produced by tea plants infested with tea green leafhoppers. To explore whether its production is related to the upstream effects of JA, tea leaves were treated with JA for 24 hours and then the changes in the (E)-nerolidol content and in the expression of CsNES were analyzed. Surprisingly, the effects of the JA treatment were similar to those of the tea green leafhopper infestation. The JA treatment significantly increased the (E)-nerolidol content in tea leaves (Fig. 1c) while also activating the expression of CsNES (Fig. 1c). These findings implied that the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by a tea green leafhopper infestation is closely related to the JA signaling pathway. The gene expression associated with biotic stress responses is modulated by epigenetic modifications, especially histone acetylations. To verify whether histone acetylations contribute to the formation of (E)-nerolidol after an infestation by tea green leafhoppers, tea leaves were treated with HDAC inhibitors for 24 hours, after which the (E)-nerolidol content and the expression of (E)-nerolidol synthesis-related genes were analyzed. Consistent with the observed changes induced by the tea green leafhopper infestation, the HDAC inhibitor treatment significantly increased the (E)-nerolidol level in tea plants (Fig. 1c). It also induced the expression of CsNES (Fig. 1c), indicating that HDAC mediates the production of (E)-nerolidol. A recent study identified 14 HDACs in tea plants. To assess whether a tea green leafhopper infestation induces the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol by affecting HDACs, we examined the expression of 14 HDAC genes in response to tea green leafhoppers. At two post-infestation time-points, the expression levels of most of the HDAC genes were downregulated. The exceptions were CsHDA6 and CsSRT1-2, which had upregulated expression levels (Fig. 2a). Because HDACs are usually transcriptional repressors, we speculated that the HDAC genes (e.g. CsHDA2 and CsHDA8) with downregulated expression levels at the two analyzed time-points likely encode regulators of (E)-nerolidol accumulation. These results indicate that infestation by tea green leafhoppers regulates the expression of HDAC genes. A previous study involving Arabidopsis confirmed that JA does not regulate AtHDA8 expression. Thus, we selected CsHDA2 for subsequent analyses. We prepared an anti-CsHDA2 polyclonal antibody solution and validated it with an Escherichia coli expression protein (Supplementary Data Fig. S1), and then used it to detect changes in the CsHDA2 level following an infestation by tea green leafhoppers. The results indicated that the abundance of CsHDA2 decreased after the tea green leafhopper infestation, which was consistent with the CsHDA2 expression data (Fig. 2b). HDACs are usually transcriptional regulators in the nucleus. Accordingly, we examined the subcellular localization of CsHDA2 in vivo. We cloned the tea CsHDA2 gene and fused its coding sequence to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) gene sequence. The resulting fusion construct was transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts, wherein the fluorescence of CsHDA2–YFP was detected only in the nucleus along with the nuclear localization marker mCherry signal (Fig. 4a). This suggested that CsHDA2 may be a nuclear protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator. To further functionally characterize CsHDA2, we expressed CsHDA2–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in tobacco leaves (Fig. 4b). HDAC activity was determined by a colorimetry-based assay. The positive control was HeLa nuclear extract containing the HDAC mixture. Additionally, the specificity of the deacetylase activity was verified by adding the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Unlike the negative control, the CsHDA2–GFP protein had HDAC activities (Fig. 4c), which were significantly inhibited by trichostatin A. HDACs usually form complexes with transcription factors to perform their functions. We previously demonstrated that the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by a tea green leafhopper infestation is related to the JA pathway and HDAC. This compelled us to determine whether CsHDA2 directly interacts with CsMYC2. We first detected the protein interaction between CsHDA2 and CsMYC2 in a yeast two-hybrid experiment. Yeast cells co-transformed with AD-CsHDA2 and BD-CsMYC2 grew on the selective medium QDO, suggesting that CsHDA2 directly interacts with CsMYC2 (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the yeast two-hybrid experiment result also showed that CsHDA8 did not interact with CsMYC2 (Supplementary Data Fig. S2). Furthermore, CsHDA2–GFP and CsMYC2–FLAG were transiently expressed in tobacco leaves for a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis to verify the interaction in vivo. The CsMYC2–FLAG fusion protein was detected after the CsHDA2–GFP immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP antibody-coated magnetic beads (Fig. 4e). Our results indicated that CsHDA2 directly interacted with CsMYC2 both in vivo and in vitro. To evaluate whether CsMYC2 regulates CsNES expression, we performed a dual-luciferase reporter assay to detect transient expression. The dual-luciferase reporter plasmid contained the CsNES promoter fused to the LUC-encoding sequence. The REN-encoding sequence under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter was taken as an internal control, whereas the CsMYC2–FLAG plasmid was used as the effector (Fig. 5a). The expression of CsMYC2 significantly activated the CsNES promoter activity in comparison with the control (Fig. 5b), indicating that CsMYC2 may act as a transcriptional promoter that induces CsNES expression. Because CsMYC2 can promote CsNES expression and directly interact with CsHDA2, we examined whether CsNES is a direct downstream target gene of CsMYC2 and CsHDA2 following a tea green leafhopper infestation. The MYC2 transcription factor usually targets the G-box (CACATG) motif or its variant (E-box) in JA-responsive gene promoters to regulate expression. An analysis of the CsNES promoter revealed the presence of two E-box elements (Fig. 6a). Thus, we investigated the effects of an infestation by tea green leafhoppers on the binding of CsMYC2 to this region as well as to one other promoter region that lacks E-box elements. The specific binding of CsMYC2 to the P2 region (containing E-box elements) increased significantly at 48 hours post-infestation, but there were no further increases at 96 hours (Fig. 6b). We subsequently assessed the effects of a tea green leafhopper infestation on the binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter via a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment. The results indicated that the binding of CsHDA2 to the P2 region of the CsNES promoter decreased significantly at 48 hours post-infestation. In contrast, the binding of CsHDA2 to the P2 regions increased at 96 hours post-infestation (Fig. 6b). These observations implied that an infestation by tea green leafhoppers may modulate CsNES expression by affecting the binding of CsMYC2 and CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter. Then, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to confirm the ability of CsMYC2 to bind to 3′-biotin-labeled probes, which contained two E-box motifs in the CsNES promoter in vitro. The purified GST (glutathione-S-transferase)–CsMYC2 fusion protein bound to the E-box, which contained a fragment of CsNES (Fig. 6c). Since CsHDA2 directly interacted with CsMYC2, we further determined if the interaction affected the binding of CsMYC2 to the CsNES promoter. Therefore, purified GST–MYC2 and GST–CsHDA2 fusion proteins were reacted with biotin-labeled probe containing the E-box motif. The result suggested that CsHDA2 did not bind to the E-box probe. Besides, the binding of CsMYC2 to the E-box probe was not changed when increasing amounts of CsHDA2 or GST were added (Fig. 6c). These findings indicated that CsHDA2 was not directly bound to the E-box region of the CsNES promoter, and would not inhibit the binding of CsMYC2 to the promoter of CsNES. Previous research confirmed that CsHDA2 has HDAC activity. To explore whether the increase in CsNES expression caused by a tea green leafhopper infestation is related to the changes in acetylation caused by altered CsHDA2 binding, we determined the H3 and H4 acetylation levels of the CsNES promoter and the first exon after a tea green leafhopper infestation (Fig. 6d). Unlike the first exon, the H4 acetylation level in the CsNES promoter increased significantly at 48 hours post-infestation (Fig. 6e). At 96 hours post-infestation, the H3 acetylation level in the CsNES promoter region increased significantly, whereas the H4 acetylation level decreased significantly (Fig. 6e). Hence, the CsNES expression induced by the tea green leafhopper infestation was likely related to an increase in the H3 and H4 acetylation levels in the promoter region."
TA043851_R_0003,"The study further examines the regulatory mechanisms of CsNES expression under exogenous JA and HDAC inhibitor treatments. JA treatment increased CsMYC2 binding to the CsNES promoter but did not significantly affect CsHDA2 binding. In contrast, HDAC inhibitor treatment elevated H3 and H4 acetylation levels in both the promoter and first exon regions of CsNES. These findings suggest that JA regulates CsNES through CsMYC2, while HDAC inhibitors modulate CsNES expression via histone acetylation changes. The study provides insights into the epigenetic regulation of plant secondary metabolism in response to herbivore stress.","Previous data showed that treatments with exogenous JA and HDAC inhibitors both induced the expression of CsNES (Fig. 1c). We then investigated how CsNES was regulated by upstream regulators and histone acetylation modification under exogenous JA and HDAC inhibitor treatments. After JA treatment for 24 hours, similar to tea green leafhopper infestation, the binding of CsMYC2 to the P2 region of the CsNES promoter was increased (Supplementary Data Fig. S3a and b). However, the binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter showed no significant difference after JA treatment for 24 hours (Supplementary Data Fig. S3a and b). After HDAC inhibitor treatment for 24 hours, the H3 and H4 acetylation levels of the CsNES promoter were increased significantly, while only the H4 acetylation level was upregulated significantly in the first exon region of CsNES (Supplementary Data Fig. S3c and d). Collectively, these results indicated that exogenous JA treatment regulated CsNES expression through CsMYC2, and HDAC inhibitor treatment regulated CsNES expression by affecting the H3 and H4 acetylation levels of the CsNES promoter and the first exon regions."
TA043851_D_0001,"The study investigates the role of histone deacetylase CsHDA2 in regulating (E)-nerolidol production in tea plants under tea green leafhopper infestation. It highlights the interaction between CsHDA2 and CsMYC2, a key transcription factor in the JA signaling pathway, and how this interaction influences CsNES expression and (E)-nerolidol accumulation. The study also explores the broader implications of histone acetylation in plant stress responses and secondary metabolite production.","Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) help the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) adapt to environmental stress, and they are also quality-related components of tea. However, the upstream mechanism regulating the herbivore-induced expression of volatile biosynthesis genes is unclear, especially at the level of epigenetic regulation. In this study, similar to the effects of a tea green leafhopper infestation, treatments with exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and histone deacetylase inhibitors significantly increased the (E)-nerolidol content in tea and induced the expression of the associated biosynthesis gene CsNES. Furthermore, a key transcription factor related to JA signaling, myelocytomatosis 2 (CsMYC2), interacted with histone deacetylase 2 (CsHDA2) in vitro and in vivo. A tea green leafhopper infestation inhibited CsHDA2 expression and decreased CsHDA2 abundance. Moreover, the tea green leafhopper infestation increased H3 and H4 acetylation levels in the promoter region of CsNES, which in turn upregulated the expression of CsNES and increased the (E)-nerolidol content. In this study, we revealed the effects of histone acetylations on the accumulation of HIPVs, while also confirming that CsHDA2-CsMYC2 is an important transcriptional regulatory module for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by tea green leafhoppers. The results of this study may be useful for characterizing plant aromatic compounds and the main upstream stress-responsive signaling molecules. Furthermore, the study findings will assist researchers clarify the epigenetic regulation influencing plant secondary metabolism in response to external stress."
TA043851_D_0002,"The discussion elaborates on the role of CsHDA2 as a negative regulator of HIPV production and its interaction with CsMYC2. It also explores the broader context of epigenetic modifications in plant stress responses, comparing findings with other species and highlighting the need for further research on other epigenetic regulators and their interactions with HDACs. The JA signaling pathway's components and their interactions with HDACs are also discussed, along with potential mechanisms for regulating CsNES expression and (E)-nerolidol accumulation.","Herbivores are important environmental factors that cause plants to produce secondary metabolites. In this study, we revealed that changes in histone acetylation contribute to HIPV production and that CsHDA2 is a negative regulator. In the absence of tea green leafhoppers, CsHDA2 interacted with CsMYC2 and inhibited downstream CsNES expression through histone deacetylation. After an infestation by tea green leafhoppers, CsHDA2 expression was downregulated. The subsequent decrease in the abundance of the encoded protein resulted in increased CsNES expression and the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol. Our findings confirmed the importance of HDACs for HIPV production. Epigenetic modifications are closely related to the production of intrinsic secondary metabolites in diverse plants. However, most of the related research has focused on DNA methylation, histone methylation, and miRNA, with relatively few reports describing the effects of histone acetylations and specific regulators. The current study revealed that the HDAC CsHDA2 interacts with CsMYC2, a key regulator of the JA signaling pathway (Fig. 4), to co-regulate the accumulation of the secondary metabolite (E)-nerolidol after tea green leafhopper infestation. In previous investigations of Arabidopsis, HDA6 and HDA19 were identified and thoroughly characterized as the HDACs involved in the JA pathway. In contrast, there has been less attention paid to HDA2. However, under 24-hour JA treatment the expression of CsNES was increased (Fig. 1c), while the binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter showed no significant difference (Supplementary Data Fig. S3b). These results indicated that JA-promoted CsNES expression might not depend on CsHDA2, or that CsHDA2 functions at an earlier time-point, which we did not detect. Earlier research suggested that HDA2 may participate in responses to cold stress, but its role in biotic stress responses was not elucidated. The current study indicates that HDA2 homologs in tea plants are involved in the biotic stress response, implying that HDA2 may have diverse functions during stress responses in various species. However, whether CsHDA2 in tea plants is involved in abiotic stress responses should be investigated. Additionally, because tea plants are exposed to multiple burdens during the pre-harvest growth and post-harvest processing stages, they produce substantial amounts of secondary metabolites to cope with environmental stress. There is a close relationship between epigenetic modifications and secondary metabolite production. In addition to HDACs, other potential epigenetic regulators of the accumulation of volatile metabolites induced by a tea green leafhopper infestation remain to be explored. If there are other epigenetic regulators involved, how do they interact with HDACs to co-regulate the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol? What is the specific mechanism underlying the coordinated or antagonistic regulation? Future research conducted to address these questions should focus on multiple networks regulating epigenetic modifications and the integrated regulatory effects of different epigenetic modifications under stress conditions. The JA pathway is an essential signal transduction pathway for inducing HIPVs. Many components of the JA signaling pathway have been identified, including a receptor (COI1), JA signaling suppressors (JAZs), and a transcription factor (MYC2) as well as its related homologs. The COI1–JAZ complex functions as a co-receptor in the JA signal transduction pathway. Specifically, COI1–JAZ interacts with the JA–isoleucine conjugate, which subsequently triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of JAZs. The released MYC2 then forms homodimers or heterodimers with MYC3 or MYC4. These dimers bind to the G-box (CACATG) motif or its variants in JA-responsive gene promoters to regulate expression. Previous studies on Arabidopsis proved that HDACs interact with multiple components of the JA signaling pathway. For example, a Co-IP analysis demonstrated that HDA6 interacts with COI1. Subsequent research indicated that HDA6 also interacts directly with JAZ1, JAZ3, and JAZ9 and inhibits EIN3/EIL1-dependent transcription. In this study, we revealed that CsHDA2 interacts with CsMYC2 to co-regulate CsNES expression (Figs 4–6), indicating that CsHDA2–CsMYC2 is an important transcriptional regulator that controls HIPV production. Collectively, these studies suggest that, in multiple species, HDACs regulate downstream gene expression by interacting with JA signaling pathway components. The HDACs usually form a complex with transcription factors and then inhibit transcription by regulating the acetylation level of downstream genes. However, a recent study proved that HDA9 in Arabidopsis deacetylates the transcription factor WRKY53 to regulate its transcriptional activity and modulate downstream gene expression. Therefore, future studies should explore whether CsHDACs have diverse regulatory effects on the accumulation of HIPVs in tea. Besides, the acetylation status of histones is firmly connected to gene expression. The acetylation of histones is related to histone acetyltransferase, while the deacetylation of histones is associated with HDAC. These enzymes have important roles affecting plant growth and development as well as responses to environmental stress. In Arabidopsis, MYC2 regulates the JA response through the formation of a complex with MED25 and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. In the current study, the extent of the histone acetylation in the CsNES promoter region increased following an infestation by tea green leafhoppers (Fig. 6e). Although CsHDA2 helps regulate this process, whether histone acetyltransferases are also involved should be investigated. In addition, the binding results showed that the binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter decreased after 48 hours and increased after 96 hours of infestation with tea green leafhoppers (Fig. 6b), and this, combined with determinations of gene expression and (E)-nerolidol content (Fig. 1b), suggests that there may be a braking mechanism to prevent the overexpression of CsNES and the excessive accumulation of (E)-nerolidol by regulating the binding of CsHDA2. Due to the importance of (E)-nerolidol in response to herbivore infestation and the decrease in H4 acetylation level in the late stage of tea green leafhopper infestation, the elevation of H3 acetylation level was essential to maintain the expression of CsNES. The changes in binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter showed a good correspondence with the changes in H4 acetylation level, but were not consistent with the changes in H3 acetylation level (Fig. 6). These results revealed that the acetylation level may be regulated by other regulators, most likely those CsHDACs whose expression was downregulated at 96 hours (Fig. 2), indicating that different CsHDACs may be involved in the regulation of early and late responses of the same downstream gene. Arabidopsis contains 18 HDACs that are divided into three families, the largest of which is the RPD3-like superfamily; HDA6, HDA19, HDA2, and HDA8 belong to this superfamily. In Arabidopsis, JA induces the expression of HDA6 and HDA19 [24]. In rice, JA increases the expression of HDA705, which is highly homologous to HDA6 and HDA19. Additionally, HDA6 is reportedly involved in the regulation of the JA response. In our study, CsHDA6 and CsHDA19-2 expression levels increased significantly in tea plants infested with tea green leafhoppers (when the JA content increased significantly) (Fig. 2a). This is consistent with the results of related studies on other species. These findings imply that HDA6 and HDA19 expression induced by JA is common among plant species. Furthermore, JA-induced HDA6 and HDA19 functions may be conserved in multiple species, but they will need to be further explored. Interestingly, there are two HDA19 homologs in tea. We observed that CsHDA19-1 expression was downregulated by an increase in JA levels, whereas CsHDA19-2 had the opposite expression trend (Fig. 2a). This differential expression of CsHDA19-1 and CsHDA19-2 may reflect the differences in the functions of the encoded proteins in response to JA. This possibility will need to be experimentally verified. A previous study regarding Arabidopsis indicated that JA does not regulate HDA8 expression. However, we observed that CsHDA8 expression was downregulated when the JA content increased (Fig. 2a), indicating that JA-induced HDA8 functions may vary among species. Therefore, the functional characterization of the homologous genes in different species is warranted. Furthermore, although HDA6, HDA19, HDA2, and HDA8 are members of the RPD3-like superfamily, they respond differently to herbivore stress. Both HDA6 and HDA19 belong to Class I, HDA2 belongs to Class III, and HDA8 is unclassified. Future studies will need to further clarify how the same upstream stress signal regulates the responses of different downstream factors as well as the interactions among different factors in the same stress response. This study explored the mechanism underlying the effect of the HDAC CsHDA2 on the production of (E)-nerolidol, which is a volatile compound in tea, following an infestation by tea green leafhoppers (Fig. 7). An infestation by tea green leafhoppers inhibits CsHDA2 expression. The subsequent decreased binding of CsHDA2 to the CsNES promoter leads to an increase in H4 acetylation levels in the promoter region, which in turn enhances the expression of CsNES and the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol. The results of this study may be useful for clarifying the regulation of tea aromatic compound biosynthesis, and they also provide important information regarding the development of plant aromas and the associated main upstream signaling substances responsive to stress. The data presented herein may form the basis of future research on the epigenetic regulation of external stress-induced plant secondary metabolism."
TA037576_I_0001,"The introduction outlines the prevalence and treatment challenges of retinoblastoma, emphasizing the need for apoptosis-inducing drugs and the potential of traditional Chinese herbal medicines, specifically celastrol from Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F, as a therapeutic agent due to its antitumor properties and mechanisms involving proteasome and NF-κB inhibition.","Retinoblastoma is the most common childhood primary intraocular malignant tumor, with an incidence ranging from 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 18,000 live births. This represents approximately 4% of all pediatric malignancies, and approximately 5000 new cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed around the world each year. Approximately 50% of children diagnosed with retinoblastoma survive their malignancy worldwide. Enucleation is the standard therapy for patients with advanced intraocular disease and is successful in treating intraocular retinoblastoma. Although enucleation can cure unilateral disease in approximately 95% of patients, it may result in vision loss and an unsatisfactory cosmetic appearance. Currently, drugs that induce apoptosis remain the main chemotherapeutic agents in medical oncology, and finding potential therapeutic drugs has been a major goal of retinoblastoma investigations. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines provide a highly fertile ground for modern drug development. Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F, also known as the Thunder of God Vine, belongs to the Celastraceae family and has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Celastrol, a tripterine, is extracted from Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F and shows potential for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that celastrol can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Further study showed that celastrol was a natural inhibitor of proteasome and NF-κB activity. The proteasome is responsible for degrading misfolded intracellular proteins and important cellular modulators, including the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Activation of the NF-κB transcription factor has been connected with multiple aspects of oncogenesis, including the regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. Inhibition of proteasome and/or NF-κB activity leads to cell death and is currently considered an attractive target for the treatment of cancer. Although celastrol, as a natural inhibitor of the proteasome and NF-κB activity, can induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines, including U937 cells, human prostate cancer cell lines, HL-60 cells, and human melanoma cells, the effects of celastrol on retinoblastoma are still not clear. Furthermore, the poor water solubility of celastrol limits its in vivo application. In a previous study, we found that poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly (ɛ-caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL) micelles had promising potential to improve the hydrophilicity of celastrol and extend its release. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of celastrol-loaded PEG-b-PCL nanopolymeric micelles on human retinoblastoma and explored the underlying mechanism of these effects."
TA037576_M_0001,"The study involved the preparation of celastrol-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ɛ-caprolactone) nanopolymeric micelles to improve the hydrophilicity of celastrol. The micelles were prepared by dissolving the polymer and celastrol in chloroform, followed by ultrasonic agitation and vacuum distillation. The release of celastrol from the micelles was studied using dialysis bags and high-performance liquid chromatography. SO-Rb 50 cells, derived from human retinoblastoma, were cultured and used to assess the inhibitory effects of celastrol nanoparticles (CNPs) on cell proliferation using the WST-8 assay. The cells were treated with various concentrations of CNPs, and cell viability was measured.","Chinese herbal celastrol (Figure 1A) was purchased from the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. The preparation of celastrol-loaded polymer micelles was performed as previously described. Briefly, celastrol-loaded PEG-b-PCL micelles were prepared by dissolving PEG-b-PCL (2000:1000, Mw/Mn = 1.18, JCS Biopolytech, Toronto, Canada; Figure 1B) (10 mg) and celastrol (2 mg) in chloroform (2 mL), and adding the solution drop-wise to ddH2O (20 mL) under ultrasonic agitation using a Type 60 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The organic solvent was then removed by vacuum distillation using a rotary evaporator to allow micelle formation. The samples were further concentrated and washed three times using a Millipore Centrifugal Filter Device (MW cutoff: 10,000 Da; Millipore, Billerica, MA) to remove free celastrol dissolved in the micelle solution, and then filtered with a syringe filter (pore size: 0.22 μm) to eliminate large polymer or celastrol aggregates. The celastrol-release study from polymer micelles in vitro was performed as previously described. Briefly, freeze-dried micelle samples (12 mg each) were resuspended in 3 mL of phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.4) or sodium acetate buffered solution (pH 5.0) and then transferred into a dialysis bag (MW cutoff: 14,000 Da). The bag was placed into the same buffered solution (50 mL). The release study was performed at 37°C in a New Brunswick Scientific C24 incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ). At selected time intervals, buffered solution outside the dialysis bag was removed for reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography columns (UltiMate 3000 HPLC System, Thermo Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA; 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) analysis and replaced with fresh buffer saline. Celastrol concentration was calculated based on the absorbance intensity at 425 nm. The cumulative amount of drug released was calculated, and the percentages of drug released from micelles were plotted against time. SO-Rb 50 cells, derived from a patient with human retinoblastoma, have been constantly preserved in our laboratory and were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The inhibitory effects of celastrol nanoparticles (CNPs) on SO-Rb 50 cell proliferation were measured using the 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4- disulf-ophenyl)-2H tetrazolium monosodium salt (WST-8) reagent (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. SO-Rb 50 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 103 per well in triplicate in fresh medium for 24 hours. The CNPs were then diluted to appropriate concentrations and immediately applied to the cells. Dose-dependent inhibition was assessed by exposing cells to various concentrations of CNPs (0–54.4 μg/mL) and the same dosage of PEG-b-PCL micelles without celastrol, and culturing cells for an additional 48 hours. A time-dependent inhibition was performed by exposing cells to CNPs at a concentration of 27.2 μg/mL and or the same dose of blank micelles for 24, 48, and 72 hours. WST solution (10 μL) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. Cell viability was measured at 450 nm. Variations in cell morphology were captured after treatment with CNPs for 48 hours. For comparison, the antiproliferation effect of free celastrol on SO-Rb 50 cells was also evaluated for celastrol dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (0.2%, v/v), concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μg/mL for 48 hours and at a concentration of 2 μg/mL for 24, 48, and 72 hours. The measurement protocol was followed according to the description above."
TA037576_M_0002,"The study further evaluated the apoptotic effects of CNPs on SO-Rb 50 cells using immunofluorescence to observe nuclear morphology changes and flow cytometry to quantify apoptosis. Western blotting was used to assess the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 proteins. A human retinoblastoma xenograft model was established in NOD-SCID mice to study the inhibitory effects of CNPs on tumor growth in vivo. Tumor size was measured periodically, and histological analysis was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining to assess tissue morphology. All experiments were repeated three times, and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS.","SO-Rb 50 cells were allowed to grow on coverslips in a six-well culture plate (Corning, NY) for 24 hours. Next, the cells were treated with 54.4 μg/mL CNPs or blank micelles for 24 hours at 37°C. Cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then stained with Hoechst 33342 for 10 minutes. Nuclear morphology was observed under a fluorescence microscope. Apoptotic cells were identified by changes in nuclear morphology, such as chromatin condensation and fragmentation. Samples were labeled with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and propidium iodide (PI) double staining according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, after treatment with CNPs, cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Next, the cells were resuspended in 200 μL of binding buffer (10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid/NaOH pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2) and 10 μL of annexin V-FITC for 15 minutes in the dark. Then, 300 μL of binding buffer and 5 μL of PI were added to the samples for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the samples were analyzed using flow cytometry. SO-Rb 50 cells were treated with 54.4 μg/mL CNPs or the same dose of blank micelles for 48 hours prior to determining Bcl-2, Bax, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 protein expression. The cells were collected, lysed, and the total protein concentration was quantified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An equal amount of each protein sample was loaded on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for 2 hours and incubated with anti- Bcl-2, anti-Bax, anti-NF-κB p65, anti-phospho-NF-κB p65, and anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4°C. Then, the membranes were washed and exposed to goat-anti-rabbit-IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by imaging with a chemiluminescent substrate. The signal was assayed using the ChemiDoc XRs+(Bio-RAD, Hercules, CA) with enhanced chemiluminescence and analyzed using Image Lab (ECL). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as the loading control. All animals in this study were used according to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement in a protocol approved by the Zhongshan Ophthalmology Center in Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Retinoblastoma mouse models were performed as previously described. Briefly, SO-Rb 50 tumor xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection of 5 × 107 cells into the right flanks of 5- to 6-week-old female NOD-SCID mice. When tumors reached a mean tumor volume of 100–200 mm3, as determined by the formula: volume = length × width2 × 0.5, the animals were randomly divided into two groups (five mice per group). The CNP group received intraperitoneal injections of CNPs (27.2 mg/kg/2 days); the control group was given the same dose of blank micelles by intraperitoneal injection. Tumor size was measured using vernier calipers every 4 days. In the tumor survival study, mice were euthanized according to our animal protocol, which instructed that the mice be euthanized within 1 week of the tumor size reaching > 1000 mm3. Tumor tissue was isolated, fixed in 10% formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, 4-μm-thick sections of tumor tissue were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin solution. Tissue morphology was assessed by light microscopy. All experiments were repeated three times. Quantitative variables are presented as the mean ± standard deviation and analyzed using the SPSS (v16.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). An independent sample t-test was performed to determine the significance of differences between the control and CNP-treated groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05."
TA037576_R_0001,"The study evaluates the antitumor activity of celastrol nanoparticles (CNPs) in a retinoblastoma xenograft model. CNPs were developed to improve the hydrophilicity of celastrol, a Chinese herbal medicine with known antitumor properties. The nanoparticles exhibited a celastrol-loading content of 7.36% and a mean diameter of 48 nm. In vitro release studies showed a biphasic release profile, with faster release at pH 5.0 compared to pH 7.4. CNPs inhibited the proliferation of SO-Rb 50 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 17.733 μg/mL after 48 hours. Free celastrol showed a lower IC50 of 0.843 μg/mL, indicating its enhanced inhibitory effect. CNPs also induced apoptosis in SO-Rb 50 cells, as evidenced by morphological changes and flow cytometry analysis.","The data for celastrol-loading content, measurements of dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy analysis of CNP diameters have been collected in our previous study. Our results showed that the celastrol-loading content is 7.36% and the mean diameter of CNPs with spherical shapes 48 nm. The in vitro release behaviors of celastrol-loaded micelles in two different buffered solutions (pH 7.4 and 5.0) were studied (Figure 1C). In both solutions, a typical release profile featuring two phases was observed. That is, a relatively rapid release occurred in the first stage, followed by sustained and slow release over a prolonged time up to several weeks. In comparison with the release at pH 7.4, celastrol release from micelles at pH 5.0 is much faster. The inhibitory effect of CNPs on SO-Rb 50 cells was assessed using the WST-8 assay, and the results are shown in Figure 2. SO-Rb 50 cells exposed to CNPs for 48 hours at concentrations ranging from 3.4–54.4 μg/mL showed decreased cell viability as a function of concentration. Cell viability was approximately 30% relative to the control cells at a concentration of 27.2 μg/mL CNPs. Changes in the morphology of cells revealed that increasing the amount of CNPs decreased the number and size of SO-RB 50 cells (Figure 2A). Cell viability was determined after treatment with either blank micelles or CNPs at different concentrations (Figure 2B). CNPs had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation with an IC50 value of 17.733 μg/mL after exposure to CNPs for 48 hours. The IC50 of free celastrol on SO-Rb 50 cells was 0.843 μg/mL. Figure 2C demonstrates a time-dependent decrease in the cell viability of SO-Rb 50 cells. CNP-treated cells (27.2 μg/mL) had a viability of 31.94% compared to controls following exposure for 48 hours. Free celastrol revealed an enhanced inhibitory effect on SO-Rb 50 cells at different time points (Figure 2C). Therefore, it can be concluded that the CNPs inhibited proliferation of human SO-Rb 50 cell growth in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. To investigate the effect of CNPs on apoptosis, we stained SO-Rb 50 cells with Hoechst 33342 after 24 hours of exposure to 54.4 μg/mL CNPs, and subsequently, examined changes in cell morphology using a fluorescence microscope. Figure 3 depicts the significant morphological changes in nuclear chromatin after treatment with CNPs for 24 hours. Untreated cells contain round nuclei with homogeneous chromatin (Figure 3A), whereas the nuclei of cells treated with CNPs display classic morphological characteristic of apoptosis, including a reduction in nuclear size, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation (Figure 3B). To quantify cellular apoptosis, the SO-Rb 50 cells were treated with CNPs at concentrations of 0, 27.2, 54.4, and 108.8 μg/mL for 24 hours. The cells were subsequently co-stained with annexin V-FITC/PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. Representative dot plots of annexin V-FITC/PI staining of SO-Rb 50 cells are shown in Figure 4A, and the percentage of apoptotic cells relative to CNP concentration are shown in Figure 4B. Only a small number of apoptotic cells were detected in 0 and 27.2 μg/mL CNP-treated groups. However, a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells could be detected in the 54.4 and 108.8 μg/mL CNP-treated groups. The number of SO-Rb 50 cells undergoing early- and late-stage apoptosis were 6.7% and 24.4%, respectively, following incubation with 54.4 μg/mL CNPs for 24 hours. The corresponding numbers in the 108.8 μg/mL CNP treatment group were 6.3% and 48.4%, respectively. This demonstrates that CNPs induced apoptosis, especially late-stage apoptosis, in a dose-dependent manner."
TA037576_R_0002,"The study further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying CNP-induced apoptosis in SO-Rb 50 cells. Western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in the expression of Bcl-2, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 proteins after 48 hours of exposure to 54.4 μg/mL CNPs. Although Bax expression remained unchanged, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased significantly, suggesting a pro-apoptotic effect. In vivo studies using a retinoblastoma xenograft model in NOD/SCID mice demonstrated that CNPs (27.2 mg/kg, administered every other day for 16 days) significantly suppressed tumor growth, reducing tumor volume and weight without affecting body weight. Histological analysis confirmed increased apoptosis in CNP-treated tumor tissues, characterized by hyperchromatic nuclei and reduced nuclear size.","We determined the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 to understand the effect of CNPs on apoptosis-related proteins in SO-Rb 50 cells. After 48 hours of exposure to 54.4 μg/mL CNPs, the levels of Bcl-2, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 decreased significantly (Figure 5A). Although the expression of Bax showed little change, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 increased significantly (Figure 5B). Following the investigation of apoptosis induction in SO-Rb 50 cells in vitro, the antitumor effect of celastrol nanoparticles was evaluated in vivo. We established a retinoblastoma xenograft model by injecting SO-Rb 50 cells into NOD/SCID mice. Administration of 27.2 mg/kg CNPs every other day for 16 days substantially suppressed tumor volume (Figure 6A) and reduced tumor weight (Figure 6C). The average tumor volume in the control mice increased from 107.08 ± 8.60 mm3 to 1091.41 ± 75.74 mm3 after 16 days, whereas the average tumor volume in the CNP-treated mice decreased from 112.36 ± 7.52 mm3 to 76.11 ± 6.14 mm3 (Figure 6A). Additionally, the average tumor weight in the control group was 623.20 ± 108.85 mg, whereas the average tumor weight in the CNP-treated group was only 58.80 ± 18.13 mg (Figure 6C), indicating a significant inhibition of tumor growth. However, the same dose of CNPs had no significant effect on the body weight of mice compared to the control group (Figure 6B). In control tumor tissue sections, the retinoblastoma cell nuclei were large with prominent nucleoli, and only a few cells showed a reduction in nuclear size with deeply stained nuclei and condensed cytoplasm (Figure 7A). In contrast, a greater number of cells had hyperchromatic nuclei and a reduction in nuclear size in the CNP-treated group (Figure 7B)."
TA037576_D_0001,"The study investigates the antitumor activity of celastrol nanoparticles (CNPs) in a xenograft retinoblastoma model. Celastrol, a Chinese herbal medicine, has shown antitumor effects but suffers from poor water solubility. To address this, CNPs were developed using PEG-b-PCL nanopolymeric micelles to improve hydrophilicity. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CNPs inhibit SO-Rb50 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 17.733 μg/mL. CNPs also induced apoptosis, as evidenced by nuclear morphology changes and flow cytometry. Western blotting revealed decreased expression of Bcl-2, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65, while the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased. In vivo, CNPs inhibited retinoblastoma growth in NOD-SCID mice and induced apoptosis in tumor cells.","In this study, we demonstrate that CNPs can suppress the growth of human retinoblastoma in a xenograft mouse model. One of the major mechanisms through which CNPs mediate their effects against retinoblastoma is by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Celastrol can inhibit the proliferation of multiple tumor cell lines in vivo and in vitro through the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells and the suppression of tumor angiogenesis. However, the effect of celastrol on retinoblastoma has not previously been addressed. Additionally, the poor water solubility of celastrol is an obstacle to further therapeutic applications. PEG-b-PCL polymeric micelles have been widely investigated in medical research due to their ability to increase hydrophilicity and extend the release of a drug. Drug-loaded polymeric micelles target tumor tissues through enhanced permeation and retention of the vasculature surrounding tumors. Therefore, nanopolymeric micelles have been considered as an important and attractive class of drug carriers. Previously, it has been reported that PEG-b-PCL micelles loaded with anticancer drugs could significantly improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, we chose PEG-b-PCL as the celastrol delivery carrier to further study the effects of CNPs on retinoblastoma in a xenograft mouse model. In a previous study, we demonstrated that PEG-b-PCL could significantly improve the water solubility of celastrol. We found a typical two-phase-release profile of celastrol release from micelles. Additionally, faster release of celastrol in acidic conditions was also observed, consistent with previous reports. This pH-dependent releasing behavior is of particular interest in achieving the tumor-targeted celastrol delivery with micelles. Micellar particles are generally internalized inside the cells by endocytosis; therefore, faster release inside the lysosome of tumor cells (at approximately pH 5.0) may occur due to the decreased pH values. Celastrol is a component of several herbal medicines that have been known to have antitumor activity. Celastrol itself has antiproliferative activity on different tumor cell lines. In the present study, an in vitro WST assay demonstrated that CNPs inhibit the proliferation of SO-Rb 50 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 17.733 μg/mL (celastrol-loading content: 7.36%, concentration of celastrol: 1.305 μg/mL). Free celastrol had an IC50 value of 0.843 μg/mL and also showed an enhanced inhibitory effect on SO-Rb 50 cells at different time points. The lower potency of micelle-delivered celastrol may be due to a delayed celastrol release from micelles, which is consistent with our study of in vitro celastrol release study. To further analyze CNP-induced cytotoxicity, we investigated the apoptotic effects of CNPs on SO-Rb 50 cells. Apoptosis is an important method of maintaining the balance between cell division and cell death, and the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is an important focus of antitumor drug discovery. This study demonstrates that morphological changes occur in the nucleus of SO-Rb 50 cells following treatment with CNPs for 24 hours. Flow analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in CNP-treated SO-Rb 50 cells. In vivo, CNPs significantly inhibited the growth of retinoblastoma in a xenograft tumor model in NOD-SCID mice. Additionally, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that CNPs induced apoptosis in the retinoblastoma cells."
TA037576_D_0002,"The study further explores the mechanisms by which CNPs induce apoptosis in retinoblastoma cells. The Bcl-2 family proteins, including anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Bax, play a critical role in regulating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. CNPs were found to downregulate Bcl-2 expression, increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which may trigger apoptosis. Additionally, NF-κB, a transcription factor linked to apoptosis inhibition and tumor growth, was suppressed by CNPs. SO-Rb50 cells showed high levels of NF-κB p65 and phospho-NF-κB p65, but CNP treatment reduced their expression. This suggests that CNPs induce apoptosis in retinoblastoma cells by modulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and inhibiting NF-κB activity, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic alternative for retinoblastoma.","Bcl-2 family members include both anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, and pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax. These proteins are essential in regulating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Overexpression of Bax enhances cell apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2 inhibits this process. A change in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio could lead to cell death. In the current study, CNPs downregulated the expression of Bcl-2, and thereby increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in SO-Rb 50 cells. This suggests that CNPs could change the expression of apoptotic proteins and may trigger apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway in SO-Rb 50 cells. NF-κB is a transcription factor that is strongly related to the inhibition of apoptosis, in addition to contributing to tumor growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Overexpression of NF-κB factors has been shown to block apoptosis. In human retinoblastoma cells, the transcriptional activity of NF-κB is necessary for survival. A recent study suggested that the expression of p65 and c-Rel proteins, NF-κB transcription factor family members, represented a reliable marker for human retinoblastoma. Celastrol has previously been considered a natural NF-κB inhibitor. In this study, SO-Rb 50 cells expressed higher levels of NF-κB p65 and phospho-NF-κB p65, consistent with previous studies. In contrast, the expression of NF-kB p65 and phospho-NF-κB p65 was decreased in the CNP-treated group. Celastrol displayed potent suppression of NF-κB p65 activity in human retinoblastoma cells. This may be one of the mechanisms through which CNPs induce apoptosis in SO-Rb 50 cells."

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Celastrol, a Chinese herbal medicine, has shown antitumor activity against various tumor cell lines. However, the effect of celastrol on retinoblastoma has not yet been analyzed. Additionally, the poor water solubility of celastrol restricts further therapeutic applications. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of celastrol nanoparticles (CNPs) on retinoblastoma and to investigate the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS: Celastrol-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ɛ-caprolactone) nanopolymeric micelles were developed to improve the hydrophilicity of celastrol. The 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulf-ophenyl)-2H tetrazolium monosodium salt (WST-8) assay was used to determine the inhibitory effect of CNPs on SO-Rb50 cell proliferation in vitro. Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the apoptotic effect of CNPs on nuclear morphology, and flow cytometry was used to quantify cellular apoptosis. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, NF-κB p65, and phospo-NF-κB p65 proteins was assessed by Western blotting. A human retinoblastoma xenograft model was used to evaluate the inhibitory effects of CNPs on retinoblastoma in NOD-SCID mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to assess the apoptotic effects of CNPs on retinoblastoma. RESULTS: CNPs inhibit the proliferation of SO-Rb 50 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with an IC(50) of 17.733 μg/mL (celastrol-loading content: 7.36%) after exposure to CNPs for 48 hours.

Additionally, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased, whereas the expression of Bax itself was not significantly altered. CNPs inhibit the growth of retinoblastoma and induce apoptosis in retinoblastoma cells in mice.

TA019095_I_0001,"The introduction discusses the role of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, the activation of microglia under noxious stimuli, and the need for novel anti-neuroinflammation agents, highlighting costunolide as a natural sesquiterpene lactone with anti-inflammatory properties and its potential molecular targets.","Neuroinflammation is a crucial pathological process of various neurodegenerative diseases. Microglia are major immune cells in brain. In physiological status, microglia are in a resting or task-negative state. However, microglia can be over-activated under continuous noxious stimuli, resulting in inflammatory mediator release as well as further neuronal damage. Due to a shortage of efficient drugs and high toxic side effects, novel anti-neuroinflammation agents need to be developed for clinical application. Natural products derived from medicinal herbs play an important role in developing innovative medicines to treat inflammatory diseases. Costunolide (CTL) is a principal active sesquiterpene lactone from medicinal plant Aucklandia lappa Decne. CTL has been reported to exhibit various health benefits including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and antiallergic properties. Recently, the anti-inflammatory activity of CTL has especially attracted great attention. Investigations in vivo have demonstrated that CTL alleviates heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus or lipoteichoic acid-induced acute lung injury via inhibition of pulmonary neutrophil infiltration. Moreover, CTL also ameliorates experimental pleurisy and ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in mice. However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of CTL and its potential molecular targets are still unclear. In this study, we confirmed that CTL significantly inhibited microglia-mediated neuroinflammation by suppressing several inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) as a direct cellular target of CTL. CTL exerts anti-neuroinflammation via CDK2-dependent AKT/IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings indicate CTL is a potential candidate agent for anti-neuroinflammation, and CDK2 may act as a promising therapeutic target for treatment of neuroinflammation."

Abstract: Hyperactivation of microglia in the brain is closely related to neuroinflammation and leads to neuronal dysfunction. Costunolide (CTL) is a natural sesquiterpene lactone with wide pharmacological activities including anti-inflammation and antioxidation. In this study, we found that CTL significantly inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia. Moreover, CTL effectively attenuated IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway activation. To identify direct cellular target of CTL, we performed high-throughput reverse virtual screening assay using scPDB protein structure library, and found cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) was the most specific binding protein for CTL. We further confirmed the binding ability of CTL with CDK2 using cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assays. Surface plasmon resonance analysis also supported that CTL specifically bound to CDK2 with a dissociation constant at micromole level. Furthermore, knocking down CDK2 obviously reversed the anti-inflammation effect of CTL via AKT/IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway on BV-2 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that CTL inhibits microglia-mediated neuroinflammation through directly targeting CDK2, and provide insights into the role of CDK2 as a promising anti-neuroinflammation therapeutic target."
TA019095_R_0002,"The study evaluates the fumigant toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against S. zeamais adults, showing dose- and time-dependent mortality. The oil's major constituents, terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol, exhibit potent activity. Enzyme inhibition assays reveal significant dose- and time-dependent effects on AChE, GST, and CarE. RNA-Seq analysis identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to respiration and xenobiotic metabolism, validated by qRT-PCR.","Result: To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais. The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed. To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C). A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes). To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil. To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable."

Discussion**  Accumulating evidences suggest that a crucial risk factor of neurodegenerative disorders is highly associated with neuroinflammation [\[23\]](#page-10-16). Microglial over-activation leads proinflammatory cytokines secretion, further triggering synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, contributing to neuroinflammation-related pathological changes [\[24](#page-10-17)[,25\]](#page-10-18). LPS stimulation can cause a profound attenuated LPS-induced NF-κB pathway activation. immune response in the brain, which leads to the activation of microglia including BV2 [\[26\]](#page-10-19). A review reported that when CTL concentration is 0.8–2 µM, it has neuroprotective effect; when the concentration is in the range of 0.1–12.5 µM, CTL has anti-inflammatory activity; it can inhibit cell proliferation and mediate apoptosis when the concentration is around 10–100 µM [\[27\]](#page-11-0). In this work, we investigated anti-neuroinflammation role of natural sesquiterpene lactone CTL in LPS-induced BV2 microglia, and further explored its molecular mechanism. We confirmed CTL inhibited LPS-induced neuroinflammation response in BV2 microglia. CTL significantly inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide, TNF-α, IL-6, and PGE2. Moreover, CTL down-regulated expressions of iNOS and COX2. Furthermore, CTL effectively inhibited AKT kinase phosphorylation, prevented phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit, and Cellular target identification is a crucial prerequisite for clarifying biological mechanism of candidate drug. Reverse virtual screening which is based on 'lock-key principle' of molecular docking is an effective method for cellular target identification [\[28\]](#page-11-1). The interaction between ligand and target protein is a process of molecular recognition, including electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and van der Waals interaction. Through reverse virtual screening, the binding mode and affinity of ligand–target protein can be predicted. This method has been successfully used for cellular target identification and pharmacological mechanism researches of natural active molecules [\[29\]](#page-11-2). For example, reverse virtual docking was used to predict the targets of apple polyphenols in preventing colorectal cancer, and the main targets were guanosine 5<sup>0</sup> -monophosphate oxidoreductase (GMP reductase), guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) [\[30\]](#page-11-3). Reverse virtual docking was also reported to predict the targets of an aminopyridine derivative as cyclin dependent kinases, Bcr-Abl kinase and KIT receptor kinase [\[31\]](#page-11-4). In this work, reverse virtual screening was performed to explore the cellular target of CTL. We identified that CDK2 was the target of CTL by screening scPDB protein structure library. CDK2 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in DNA damage responds and cell cycle control [\[32–](#page-11-5)[34\]](#page-11-6). Therefore, CDK2 is a promising target for neurodegenerative disorders, cerebral hypoxia, and cancers. Great progress has been made in the study of CDK2 in cell apoptosis, but its research in neuroinflammation needs to be further explored. Our molecular docking diagram and surface potential diagram showed that CTL bound to a cavity of CDK2 and formed hydrophobic interaction with alanine, valine, phenylalanine, and leucine residues around the cavity. Furthermore, the superposition analysis of CDK2-ATP and CDK2-CTL revealed that CTL occupied ATP binding site of CDK2. Therefore, we concluded that CTL affected CDK2 function by competitively binding with ATP to the active site of CDK2. On the other hand, SPR analysis suggested that CTL specifically bound to CDK2 with a dissociation constant at micromole level. Moreover, CETSA [\[35\]](#page-11-7) and DARTS [\[36\]](#page-11-8) are the important methods to verify the binding of small molecules to their target proteins. Our CETSA and DARTS analysis also confirmed that CTL could increase the resistance of CDK2 to high temperature and enzymes. Therefore, CDK2 was identified to be a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting neuroinflammation."
TA019095_D_0002,"The discussion further explores the anti-inflammatory mechanism of CTL through the CDK2-mediated AKT/IKKβ/NF-κB pathway. CTL's inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and NF-κB pathway activation was reversed upon CDK2 knockdown, highlighting CDK2's critical role in neuroinflammation. This suggests CDK2 as a promising therapeutic target for anti-neuroinflammatory therapy.","After cellular target identification, we tried to further elucidate potential anti-inflammatory mechanism. AKT kinase plays a key role in controlling neurogenesis including neuron location, dendritic development and synapse upstream formation [\[37](#page-11-9)[,38\]](#page-11-10). NF-κB pathway is a canonical pathway in LPS-induced inflammatory response [\[18\]](#page-10-11). As a key upstream regulator of IKKβ/NF-κB pathway, AKT also plays an important role in regulating NF-κB-dependent inflammatory gene transcription [\[21](#page-10-14)[,22\]](#page-10-15). Therefore, we tried to explore the relationship between CDK2, AKT, and NF-κB pathway in neuroinflammation. In this study, we identified an inhibitory role of CTL in regulation of LPS-activated AKT, IKKβ, IκB-α, and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that CTL significantly inhibited the activation of NF-κB-associated inflammatory gene transcription, indicating that CTL targets on CDK2 to affect AKT phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting NF-κB pathway activation to exert anti-neuroinflammation activity. Notably, we found that CDK2 knockdown significantly reduced the inhibitory ability of CTL on inflammatory mediators production. Moreover, CTL-dependent down-regulation on the phosphorylation of AKT, IKKβ, IκB-α, and NF-κB p65 was significantly reversed when CDK2 was silenced. This observation indicates that CDK2-mediated AKT/IKKβ/NF-κB pathway is highly involved in anti-neuroinflammation effect of CTL. Meanwhile, CDK2 may act as a vital cellular target responsible for anti-neuroinflammation therapy."

In this study, we found that CTL significantly inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia. Moreover, CTL effectively attenuated IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway activation. To identify direct cellular target of CTL, we performed high-throughput reverse virtual screening assay using scPDB protein structure library, and found cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) was the most specific binding protein for CTL. We further confirmed the binding ability of CTL with CDK2 using cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assays.

TA048687_I_0001,"The introduction discusses the role of volatile organic compounds in nature, their production by various organisms, and their functions as hormones, semiochemicals, and defense compounds, with a focus on aggregation pheromones in insects, particularly in the Curculionidae family, and their importance in pest control.","Volatile organic compounds present in nature are produced and released by plants, animals, and microorganisms. Some of these compounds are produced as hormones, semiochemicals (including pheromones), as well as plant defense compounds. Other metabolites are merely biosynthetic byproducts. Communication among insect involves various modalities, including visual, vibrational, tactile, and chemical communication. Aggregation pheromones are sex specific pheromones which attracts both sexes of the species. They have been identified in species from different insect Orders, e.g. Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Dictyoptera, and Orthoptera. Various insect species in the family Curculionidae (Coleoptera), are serious agriculture pests thus prompting a great deal of research aimed at finding new methods of control or attractants for trapping systems. Most of the aggregation pheromones identified in this group are from species in the genus Rhynchophorus, e.g. rhynchophorol (6-methyl-2-(E)-hepten-4-ol) isolated from R. palmarum. A complex aggregation pheromone system, (1R,2S)-grandisol and (1R,2S)-grandisyl acetate, was identified from the first species of Homalinotus genus studied, Homalinotus validus. The chemical structures of the compounds described as aggregation pheromones of Curculionidae to date can be divided into two different classes. The first is related to mostly cyclic monoterpenoids, such as, grandisol, which was originally identified from Anthonomus grandis. The second class is represented by short, and methyl branched alcohols, ketones, and esters, as for example 3-hydroxy-4-methyl-5-nonanone, identified as a component of Metamasius hemipterus pheromone."
TA048687_I_0002,"The introduction highlights the economic and social importance of coconut cultivation in Brazil, the impact of pest insects like Homalinotus depressus on coconut production, and the need for environmentally friendly control methods, including the identification and use of aggregation pheromones for pest management.","Coconut (Cocos nucifera, Arecaceae) is one of the main Brazilian fruit crops, with social and economic importance due to the diverse range of products obtained e.g. coconut water, coconut milk, wood, fibers, biofuel, animal food, and oils, among others derivatives useful to the agro-industry. Pest insects cause significant losses to worldwide coconut industry. Pest outbreaks are favored by plant intrinsic factors, such as continuous production of leaves and inflorescences, or extrinsic factors, including temperature, humidity, poorly conducted cultural dealings, and excessive use of pesticides leading to reduced populations of natural enemies. Homalinotus depressus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) occurs in the Antilles, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, and Suriname. H. depressus larvae construct galleries inside coconut trees, floral peduncle and stipe, thus interrupting the sap flow and promoting failing of flowers and fruits. In 2008, H. depressus was reported for the first time as a coconut pest in the Brazilian northern region. Management of H. depressus populations is largely based on applications of carbamates or organophosphates. Due to the lack of lures for trapping adult beetles, population densities are estimated by manual collections of beetles in the field. Therefore, semiochemicals, such as sex and/or aggregation pheromones, are highly desirable for trapping and possibly use in direct control strategies (e.g., mass trapping, attraction-and-kill, and mating disruption. Here, we describe the isolation, identification, and field evaluation of an aggregation pheromone produced by H. depressus."

Their separation on a GC enantioselective column (β-Dex325®), allowed us to unambiguously determine that the absolute configuration of natural homalinol was (1R,2R,6S). Field bioassays demonstrated that both the synthetic major compound per se and mixtures of all four male-specific compounds were attractive to H. depressus."
TA048687_R_0002,"Volatile compounds from male H. depressus were collected and analyzed, revealing four male-specific compounds. Olfactometer assays showed these compounds attracted both sexes, suggesting a sex aggregation pheromone. Retention indexes and spectral data (IR, MS) identified the compounds, with isophorone (2) confirmed by comparison to an authentic standard. Epoxyisophorone (1) was synthesized and confirmed structurally.","Volatile compounds emitted by H. depressus (kept under laboratory conditions) were collected by aeration and the GC comparison of aeration extracts from males to similar extracts from females showed the presence of four male-specific compounds (Fig. 1). Y-tube olfactometer assays, performed with adults of both sexes, showed that volatile compounds from males were attractive to both sexes. By contrast, response of both males and females to airborne volatile collections from females did not differ significantly from the response to control (solvent only) (Fig. 2). We, therefore, surmised that the male-specific compounds are constituents of a sex aggregation pheromone and, consequently, pursued their identification. Retention indexes (RIs) for the four natural products were calculated on RTX-5 (1–1096, 2–1119, 3–1127, 4–1158) and EC-WAX (1–1540, 2–1584, 3–1789, 4–1660) capillary columns. The mass spectrum for compound 2 showed a base peak at m/z 82, and a possible M+ at m/z 138 (Fig. 3, MS2). Its infrared spectrum suggests a trisubstituted alkene due to the C=C stretching (1640 cm−1) associated with a band at 3036 cm−1 (C-H stretching on alkenes) (Fig. 3, IR2). Two relatively intense bands were observed at 2959 and 2941 cm−1, due to asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching from CH3, thus indicating the occurrence of a branched CH3 moiety. An intense band was additionally observed at 1668 cm−1, suggesting the presence of an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Both IR and mass spectra were very similar to the spectra of 3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-2-enone (isophorone). Another similarity between isophorone and compound 2 was the RI (1117 for isophorone on a DB-5 column. Isophorone was first described in insects as a component of the defensive froth emitted by the grasshopper Romalea micropterais, and more recently described as an allelochemical eliciting oviposition repellence on The Navel Orangeworm (Ameylois transitella). The structure of 2 was subsequently confirmed to be isophorone by comparing its retention time, and mass and IR spectra with those of an authentic standard. The mass spectrum of compound 1 suggested a structure closely related to isophorone, with a base peak occurring at m/z 83 and a putative M+ ion at m/z 154, indicating a C9H14O2 molecular formula (Fig. 3, MS1). IR spectrum for this compound contained a C=O stretching band at 1722 cm−1 and three bands related to an epoxide: 3006 cm−1 (C-H stretching on epoxide carbon) and the pair of bands 1255 and 913 cm−1 (symmetric and asymmetric stretching of epoxide ring) (Fig. 3, IR1). Based on these data, compound 1 was proposed to be 4,4,6-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (epoxyisophorone) and then confirmed by synthesis, specifically, oxidation of isophorone with H2O2 in 89% yield."
TA048687_R_0003,"Homalinol (3) was identified as a novel natural product with hydroxyl and additional polar groups. Its structure was confirmed by synthesis and spectral analysis. Stereochemical studies revealed its relative and absolute configurations through reduction and epoxidation reactions. Enantioselective GC resolved the enantiomers, confirming (1R,2R,6S)-3 as the natural configuration.","The IR spectrum obtained from compound 3 showed O-H and a C-O stretching bands at 3300 and 1025 cm−1 respectively, suggesting the presence of a hydroxyl group, as well a band at 1025 cm−1 related to the axial deformation of C-O bond, indicating the presence of a hydroxyl in the structure (Fig. 3, IR3). The retention indexes (RI) calculated for this compound was 1127 on a RTX-5 column, and 1789 on an EC-WAX column. The difference between these two RIs is 656 units, while the difference expected for the presence of one hydroxyl group would be around 500. These data suggest the contribution of an additional polar group in the structure. On the other hand, the mass spectrum for 3 showed a base peak at m/z 43, 141 as the highest m/z fragment, and 123 as a possible loss of water from 141 (Fig. 3, MS3). Additionally, the data suggested 141 as being related to the M+-15 and compound 3 as being a C9H16O2. Based on this dataset, the structure of 3 was proposed to be 4,4,6-trimethyl-7-oxa-bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-ol. A mixture of all four possible stereoisomers in a ratio of 3:1 (trans:cis) was synthesized starting from 1, by a solvent free reduction with NaBH4 in the presence of boric acid in 85% yield (Fig. 4). Compound 3 is a novel natural product, being reported several times only as a synthetic derivative obtained during development of epoxidation or carbonyl reduction methodologies. In this way, compound 3 was named 'homalinol' derived from the Homalinotus genus. The diversity of recognition forms of chirality by living organisms reveals the importance of the stereochemistry studies of semiochemicals, being a target of research on insect behavior over the past five decades. The relative natural configuration of homalinol (3) was studied first by reducing epoxyisophorone (1) with freshly prepared zinc borohydride, producing trans-homalinol (trans-3) in 87% yield as a mixture of trans-3:cis-3 (99:1) (Fig. 5, Pathway A). Zinc borohydride is widely used as a hydride source for reductions of α and β-hydroxyketones and α,β-epoxyketones due to the strong chelating effect of zinc. Racemate cis-3 was obtained starting from the reduction of 2 to isophorol (5) with LiAlH4 in 95% yield followed by epoxidation with freshly prepared monoperphtalic acid (MPPA), resulting on a mixture of cis-3:trans-3 (99:1) (Fig. 5, Pathway B). The stereoselectivity of this reaction can be rationalized as a mechanism correlated to that proposed for the Prilezhaev reaction, where the epoxidation occurs in a concerted manner, with interaction between the hydroxyl hydrogen from 5 and the carboxylic oxygen of the peroxyacid from MPPA. The relative configuration of trans-3 and cis-3, obtained stereoselectively as described above, was determined based on their respective NMR spectra and previously reported data. Enantioselective GC analysis resulted in the resolution of the four stereoisomers of 3, allowing us to determine that the natural compound from H. depressus is a single enantiomer of the cis-3 mixture, (1R,2R,6S)-3 or (1S,2S,6R)-3 (Figure S1)."
TA048687_R_0004,"Kinetic resolution using lipases achieved high enantiomeric excess for homalinol enantiomers. The absolute configuration of natural homalinol was confirmed as (1R,2R,6S)-3 through specific rotation measurements. Epoxyisophorone (1) and 2-hydroxyisophorone (4) were also synthesized and their configurations determined. Field bioassays confirmed the attractiveness of the pheromone components.","Assays aiming the enantioselective synthesis of (1R,2R,6S)-3 and (1S,2S,6R)-3 were performed by kinetic resolution employing the lipases CAL-B (from Candida antarctica), AY 'Amano' 30 (from C. rugosa), AK 'Amano' 20 (from Pseudomonas fluorescens), PS 'Amano' SD (from Burkholderia cepacia), and PPL (porcine pancreatic lipase) and four different organic media: TBME, hexane, vinyl acetate and THF. Vinyl acetate was used as acetate source in all tested conditions (Fig. 6A). Results obtained by CAL-B catalysis were not satisfactory, given that good conversion rates but with low enantioselectivity were obtained. The best result using CAL-B was obtained with 24 hours of reaction with THF as solvent, with ee’s of 43.6% for the remaining alcohol and 60.8% for the acetate formed. Reactions employing AY 'Amano' 30 and PPL were not satisfactory either, due to conversion rates (c) lower that 5% even after nine days of reaction. On the other hand, better results were found in trials employing PS 'Amano' SD and AK 'Amano' 20, as shown on Table S1. PS 'Amano' SD assays resulted in excellent enantiomeric excesses for the acetate formed and consequently satisfactory enantiomeric ratios (E). It must be highlighted that the reaction employing PS 'Amano'SD and TBME in 24 hours resulted in the acetylated product with ee 98,6% (c = 39,9%, E > 200). Reactions using AK 'Amano' 20 resulted in excellent ee for the remaining alcohol with the best result found using THF in 24 hours, resulting in a mixture containing the alcohol with ee 99,9% (c = 55,5%, E = 65). PS 'Amano' SD and AK 'Amano' 20 were employed on preparative scale in order to obtain higher amounts of the acetylated product and the remaining alcohol respectively, as shown on Fig. 6B. The only stereoisomer of 3 with absolute stereochemistry previously studied was (1S,2S,6R)-3, which was assigned by NMR of the Mosher’s ester derivative, where the specific rotation found was [α]D24 = −18.8 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, ee = 38%). The alcohol and acetate from each kinetic resolution were purified by flash chromatography in order to obtain samples of enantiomerically enriched compounds 3 and 6. The specific rotation of [α]D24 = + 35.0 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, ee = 98.8%) was found for the remaining alcohol, confirming its absolute configuration as (1R,2R,6S). The alcohol (1S,2S,6R)-3 was synthesized from the basic hydrolysis of (1S,2S,6R)-6 in 92% yield (Fig. 6C), showing an [α]D24 = −34.5 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, ee = 97.5%). This is the first case of description of compounds (1S,2S,6R)-6 and (1R,2R,6S)-6 as enantiomerically enriched compounds. The acetate (1S,2S,6R)-6 showed an [α]D24 = −70.2 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, ee = 97.6%) after isolation from kinetic resolution. The (1R,2R,6S)-6 enantiomer was obtained from (1R,2R,6S)-3, by treatment with acetic anhydride and pyridine in dichloromethane in 86% yield (Fig. 6C), showing an [α]D24 = +74.9 (c = 0.86, CHCl3, ee = 98.5%). Figure 7 illustrates chromatograms obtained by GC employing a β-Dex 325® capillary column. Traces for the resolution of the racemate of cis-3, as well as the elution of enantiomers (1R,2R,6S)-3 and (1S,2S,6R)-3 are displayed. The analysis of the natural compound clearly demonstrated that it occurs as a single enantiomer which eluted with the same retention time of (1R,2R,6S)-3. Co-injection of (1R,2R,6S)-3 with the natural extract confirmed that indeed (1R,2R,6S) is the absolute configuration of this natural pheromone. The determination of the absolute configuration of epoxyisophorone (1) released by H. depressus began with the oxidation of alcohols (1S,2S,6R)-3 and (1R,2R,6S)-3 using PCC, resulting in (1R,6R)-1 (84% yield) and (1S,6S)-1 (82% yield) respectively. The synthetic racemate 1, the enantiomerically enriched (1R,6R)-1 and (1S,6S)-1, and the natural compound 1 were analyzed on the β-Dex 325® capillary column, showing that the natural compound 1 is 1S,6S, as expected due to the orientation of the epoxide group in the major component (3) (Figure S2). The IR spectrum of natural compound 4 (Fig. 3, IR4) showed an intense band at 3414 cm−1, characteristic of a hydroxyl group with a intramolecular hydrogen bond. A C=C stretching band was also observed at 1674 cm−1. On the other hand, no bands from hydrogen attached to sp2 carbons were observed, suggesting the presence of a tetrasubstituted double bond. Mass spectra obtained for this compound showed similarities with the spectra obtained for compounds 1–3, a molecular ion peak at m/z 154 and the base peak at m/z 70 (Fig. 3, MS4). These spectral data were closely related to 2-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-2-enone (2-hydroxyisophorone), which was synthesized from (1), in 60% yield under solvent free conditions (Fig. 8). The synthetic standard coeluted with the natural compound, with identical mass and IR spectra, confirming the structure of the natural compound as the diosphenol 2-hydroxyisophorone (4). Compound 4 has been described previously as component of saffron (Crocus sativus) and different types of honey. However, this is the first case of occurrence in animals. Y-tube olfactometer bioassays performed with male and female H. depressus showed attractiveness of cis-3 to both sexes, while trans-3 and a mixture of cis-3 and trans-3 (1:1 w/w) significantly attracted only males when compared to hexane controls (Table S2). Figure 9 shows the field assay results, with the mean number of insects caught in each treatment. Traps containing only isophorone (2), epoxyisophorone (1), or hexane (control) did not catch any insects, while traps containing rubber septa with trans-3, cis-3 + trans-3 (1:1 w/w), or cis-3 captured insects, but the results are not statistically different from treatments with no captures. Traps baited with cis-3, (1R,2R,6S)-3, or the complete mixture (cis-3 + 1 + 2 + 4) were significantly more attractive to insects than the other treatments but did not differ between themselves. These results showed that both, the racemate of the major component (cis-3), the pure naturally produced enantiomer ((1R,2R,6S)-3), and the mixture containing the four male-specific compounds were active under field conditions and may be used as lures for practical applications. Although the field experiment showed that the male-specific compounds are bioactive on attractiveness of conspecifics, additional field experiments are needed, to optimize operational parameters such as dose/release rate, blend ratios, and trap type. In summary, this study resulted in the identification, synthesis and field evaluation of four male specific compounds released by H. depressus and used as an aggregation pheromone. These compounds were identified as (1S,6S)-epoxyisophorone ((1S,6S)-1), isophorone (2), (1R,2R,6S)-homalinol ((1R,2R,6S)-3), and 2-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-one (4). These compounds represent a new class of structures for Curculionidae aggregation pheromones."
TA039229_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the unique adaptations of deep-sea benthic microbes, particularly in cold-seep environments, and emphasizes the potential of co-cultivation with autoclaved bacteria to activate silent biosynthetic genes in fungi, leading to the discovery of new secondary metabolites such as eremophilane and acorane sesquiterpenes.","The harsh environment in the deep sea forces the benthic microbes to develop sophisticated molecular adaptations in their primary and secondary metabolic pathways. Cold seep is one of the most unique and extraordinary ecosystems in the deep sea. The microorganisms inhabiting in the cold seep environment were able to produce unconventional secondary metabolites with diverse and abundant biosynthetic gene clusters. Eremophilane and acorane are two classes of sesquiterpenes with diverse structures, and are widely produced by various microorganisms, especially by fungal species. These metabolites were reported to exhibit multiple biological activities, such as antibacterial, anti-fungal, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory activities.We previously investigated the deep-sea cold-seep-derived fungus Furcasterigmium furcatum CS-280 and characterized several polyketide and ascochlorin derivatives with antibacterial activities from the rice solid culture of the fungus. Co-cultivation was proved as an effective method to activate microbial biosynthetic genes which were silent under standard laboratory culture conditions. There are several reports on co-cultivation experiments of fungi and heat-killed bacteria, leading to the discovery of new secondary metabolites, such as a series of sugar alcohol-conjugated acyclic sesquiterpenes and 16-residue peptaibols from the sponge-derived fungus Acremonium sp. cultivated with heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the present report, the fungus F. furcatum CS-280 was co-cocultured with autoclaved Pseudomonas aeruginosa QDIO-4 for chemical investigation. As a result, six new sesquiterpenes, including four eremophilane derivatives fureremophilanes A–D (1–4) and two acorane analogues furacoranes A and B (5 and 6), were characterized (Figure 1). This paper describes the isolation, structure determination, stereochemical assignment, and bioactivity evaluation of the isolated compounds."

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry were pivotal for structural elucidation. Isolation and purification were achieved through various chromatographic methods, including vacuum liquid chromatography, column chromatography, and semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. X-ray crystallography confirmed the crystal structures and absolute configurations of three compounds. Computational methods, including molecular mechanics and density functional theory calculations, supported the assignment of configurations and predicted electronic circular dichroism spectra. The biological activity of the compounds was assessed using a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory activity assay, and molecular docking studies were conducted to explore interaction mechanisms with the enzyme.","Detailed information for the apparatus, reagents, solvents, and materials used in the present work is the same as that described in our previous publication. Optical rotations were measured in MeOH using an Optical Activity AA-55 polarimeter (Optical Activity Ltd., Cambridgeshire, UK). UV spectra were measured on a PuXi TU-1810 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shanghai Lengguang Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). ECD spectra were acquired on a Chirascan spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Surrey, UK). 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded at 500 and 125 MHz for 1H and 13C, respectively, on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer with TMS as internal standard (Bruker Biospin Group, Karlsruhe, Germany). Mass spectra were determined on an API QSTAR Pulsar 1 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Analytical and semi-preparative HPLC were performed using a Dionex HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with P680 pump, an ASI-100 automated sample injector, and a UVD340U multiple wavelength detector controlled by Chromeleon software (version 6.80). Commercially available Si gel (200–300 mesh, Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Qingdao, China), Lobar LiChroprep RP–18 (40–63 μm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and Sephadex LH–20 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for open column chromatography.

TA039229_M_0002,"The fungal strain Furcasterigmium furcatum CS-280 was isolated from cold-seep sediments in the South China Sea and identified through ITS region sequencing. For chemical investigations, the bacterial strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa QDIO-4 was cultivated in liquid medium and then autoclaved before being used to co-culture the fungus on a rice-based substrate. After fermentation, the rice substrate was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the resulting extract was fractionated using vacuum liquid chromatography and further purified through a combination of column chromatography and semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. These steps yielded six new sesquiterpenes, which were subsequently characterized using spectroscopic and crystallographic methods.","The fungal strain Furcasterigmium furcatum CS-280 was isolated from sediment samples collected from the cold-seep environment of the South China Sea (depth 1183 m), in June 2020. The fungal strain was identified as Furcasterigmium furcatum (syn. Acremonium furcatum) according to its ITS region sequence, which is highly similar (98.93%) to that of Acremonium furcatum (LR026839.1). The sequence information of the fungus was deposited in GenBank with the accession no. OQ120564.1. The strain is preserved at the Key Laboratory of Experimental Marine Biology, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS). Detailed information for the isolation and identification of fungal strain F. furcatum CS-280 was described in the previous publication. For chemical investigations, the bacterial strain P. aeruginosa QDIO-4 was incubated in LB liquid medium (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g NaCl in 1 L distilled H2O, pH 7.0) at 37 °C, 200 rpm for 12 h, and then 10 mL of bacterial broth was inoculated into 200 × 1 L conical flasks with solid rice medium (100 g rice, 0.15 g corn syrup, 0.45 g peptone, 0.15 g methionine, and 150 mL naturally sourced and filtered seawater that was obtained from the Huiquan Gulf of the Yellow Sea near the campus of IOCAS) at room temperature. After 3 days, these flasks were autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min, and then a piece of the spore inoculum (~2 × 2 cm2) of the fungal strain F. furcatum CS-280, which was grown on PDA medium at 28 °C for 8 days, was introduced into the above mentioned autoclaved rice-substrate-containing flasks and further incubated for 44 days. The fermented rice substrate was extracted four times with EtOAc. The EtOAc extract was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to yield an organic extract (80.2 g), which was subjected to vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) over Si gel eluting with different solvents of increasing polarity from petroleum ether (PE) to MeOH to yield nine fractions (Frs. 1–9). Based on TLC and HPLC analysis, Fr. 4 (9.8 g) and Fr. 5 (6.2 g) were combined together for further isolation, yielding 9 subfractions (Frs. 4.1–4.9) by column chromatography (CC) over Lobar LiChroprep RP-18 with a MeOH–H2O gradient (from 10:90 to 90:10). Fr 4.3 was applied to CC on Si gel eluting with a PE–acetone gradient (from 15:1 to 5:1) and then purified by CC on Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) to yield compound 6 (2.0 mg).

Fr 6.6 and 6.7 was applied to semipreparative HPLC (Elite ODS-BP column, 10 μm; 20 × 250 mm; 66% MeOH–H2O, 12 mL/min) and then was further purified by CC on Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) to yield compound 1 (2.0 mg)."

Afterward, the geometries were optimized at the gas-phase B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in Gaussian09 software to afford the energy-minimized conformers. Then, the optimized conformers were subjected to the calculations of ECD spectra and specific rotation value (λ = 589.4 nm) using the CAM-B3LYP/TZVP level.

The calculated results were later obtained according to the Boltzmann weighting of each conformer. COX-2 inhibitory activity assay in vitro was performed by cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitor Screening Kit (Beyotime, Cat No. S0168, Shanghai, China). Briefly, the COX-2 enzyme was mixed with compound solution and then incluated at 37 °C for 10 min. After that, the COX-2 probe and substrate were added. Then, the fluorescence intensity values were measured with the excitation wavelength at 530 nm and the emission wavelength at 590 nm. The data was analyzed by GraphPad Prism5 (GraphPad Software Inc., Boston, MA, USA).

The preparation, optimization, and interaction of compounds 1–4 and celecoxib bonding with COX-2 and legitimacy of their activities were elaborated by AutoDock software package (, accessed on 15 October 2024, Molecular Graphics Laboratory at the Department of Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute). AutoDock tools were employed to prepare both COX-2 and compounds for docking. Through AutoDock vina, binding free energy was calculated and compounds displaying the lowest binding affinity to protein were chosen as the best conformation.

TA039229_R_0002,"Compound 1, named fureremophilane A, was identified as a reduced derivative of a known eremophilane sesquiterpene. Its structure was confirmed by NMR, X-ray crystallography, and comparison with a database entry, which was found to be inconsistent. Compounds 2 and 3, fureremophilanes B and C, were structurally related but differed in the position of the acetoxyl group. Their configurations were determined by NOESY and X-ray crystallography. Compound 4, fureremophilane D, was identified as a new eremophilane derivative with a hydroxy group at C-15, confirmed by X-ray analysis.","Compound 1 was acquired as colorless crystals. Its chemical formula was assigned as C17H24O4 on the basis of the positive HRESIMS data at m/z 293.1751 (calculated for C17H25O4, [M + H]+, 293.1747), requiring six degrees of unsaturation. The 1H and 13C NMR data revealed the presence of five methyl groups, two sp3 methylenes, one sp2 and three sp3 methines (with two oxygenated), and six nonprotonated (with one sp3 and five sp2) carbons, along with an exchangeable proton (δH 5.05) (Table 1 and Table 2). Detailed analysis of the NMR data revealed that the structure of 1 was similar to (3S)-3-acetoxyeremophil-1(2),7(11),9(10)-trien-8-one, a known eremophilane sesquiterpene isolated from Penicillium roqueforti DAOM 232127, a fungus obtained from contaminated silage in Québec. However, signals for two olefinic methines CH-1 (δH 5.79 and δC 130.75) and CH-2 (δH 5.93 and δC 131.04) in the NMR spectra of the known compound were absent, while resonances for a sp3 methylene CH2-1 (δH 2.55/2.30 and δC 35.8) and an oxygenated methine CH-2 (δH 3.64 and δC 68.5) were observed in the NMR spectra of 1 (Table 1 and Table 2), which indicated that the Δ1(2)-double bond of the known compound was reduced in compound 1. Combined with the 1H-1H COSY correlations from H-2 to H2-1 and H-3 and to the proton of OH-2, and the key HMBC correlations from the proton of OH-2 to C-1 and from H2-1 to C-9 and C-10 (Figure 2), the planar structure of 1 was established. Due to absence of some diagnostic NOE correlations, its relative configuration could not be precisely assigned by NOESY experiment. The suitable crystals of 1 were obtained by slow evaporation of a mixed solvents (MeOH and H2O), allowing for the X-ray crystallographic analysis using Cu Kα radiation. The Flack parameter 0.09(5) permitted establishment of the absolute configurations as 2S, 3R, 4R, and 5R (Figure 3). Overall, the structure of 1 was determined and was given the trivial name fureremophilane A. It should be mentioned that searching the structure of compound 1 in CAS SciFinder database gave a result showing 'a compound' (CAS number 1027589-47-4) has 100% similarity to compound 1. However, the structure of 'as drawn' compound in the database has a double bond at Δ11(12), which was different from that of compound 1 (with a double bond at Δ7(11)), and no reference describing the structure and property for the 'compound' (with CAS number 1027589-47-4) could be found. Compound 2 was isolated as yellow oil, of which the chemical formula was established as C17H24O6 by HRESIMS data. The 1H and 13C NMR data revealed the presence of four methyls, three methylenes, four methines, and six non-protonated carbons (Table 1 and Table 2). Discreet analyses of its NMR data revealed compound 2 had close relationship to 5-chloro-6-hydroxy-3a-methoxy-1a,8,8a-trimethyl-1a,2,3a,5,7,8,8a,9-octahydro-6H-naphtho [2,3-b]oxireno [2,3-c]furan-7-yl acetate, a chlorinated eremophilane sesquiterpene isolated from the fungal strain Penicillium sp. PR19N-1, which was obtained from antarctic deep-sea. However, there is no chlorine substitution in compound 2, as indicated by the HRESIMS data. The HMBC correlations from the exchangeable proton (δH 5.82, 8-OH) to C-7, C-8, and C-9 could illustrate that the methoxy group at C-8 in the reported compound also dismissed in 2. On the other hand, the double bond in compound 2 located at Δ1(10), as evidenced by the COSY correlations from the olefinic proton H-1 to the oxymehine proton H-2 as well as by the HMBC correlations from H-9 to C-1 and C-10 and from the proton of 2-OH to C-1 (Figure 2). The planar structure of compound 2 was thus determined (Figure 1). Compound 3 was isolated as colorless crystals and has same molecular formula as that of compound 2. The 1D and 2D NMR data revealed that compound 3 was reminiscent to compound 2 (Table 1 and Table 2). Supported by the COSY correlations from H-3 to the proton of 3-OH and H-2, by the HMBC correlation from H3-14 to C-3, and by the changes of chemical shifts of C-1, C-2, and C-3, the acetoxyl unit in 3 was supposed to be linked at C-2 instead of C-3 as that in 2 (Figure 2). The relative configurations at C-2, C-4, and C-5 of compounds 2 and 3 were established by NOESY cross-peaks from H3-14 to H3-15, from H-2 to H-4 (Figure 4). The small coupling constant between H-3 and H-4 (3JH-3, H-4 = 2.2 Hz) in 3 assigned cofacial relationship of these two protons, while the relative configuration of hydroxy unit at C-8 and the epoxide group at C-7/C-11 were deduced as α and β-orientations, respectively, from the prospect of biosynthesis. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment of compound 3 was carried out to further confirm the relative configurations, and the Flack parameter 0.08(4) unambiguously assigned its absolute configurations as 2S, 3R, 4R, 5R, 7R, 8R, and 11R (Figure 3). The configurations of compounds 2 and 3 were considered consistent from the biosynthetic point of view. Compounds 2 and 3 were named as fureremophilanes B and C, respectively. Compound 4 was obtained as colorless crystals and its HRESIMS data gave the molecular formula C15H22O4. The 1H and 13C NMR data resembled those of cryptosphaerolide, an ester-substituted (at C-1) eremophilane sesquiterpenoid characterized from the marine-sourced ascomycete fungal strain Cryptosphaeria sp. CNL-523. Detailed analysis of the NMR data of 4 showed that the ester moiety at C-1 in cryptosphaerolide is not present in compound 4. Instead, C-1 is a non-oxygenated methylene and a hydroxy group was linked directly to C-15 in compound 4, as verified by key 1H-1H COSY correlations from H2-2 to H2-1 and H2-3, from H-4 to H2-3 and H2-15, and from H2-15 to the proton of 15-OH (Figure 2). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment not only confirmed the structure of compound 4 but also established its absolute configuration as 4S, 5R, 7R, 8R, 9S, and 10S (Figure 3). Thus, compound 4 was assigned as a new eremophilane derivative and named as fureremophilane D."
TA039229_R_0003,"Furacorane A (5) and B (6) were identified as acorane-type sesquiterpenes. Compound 5 featured a hydroxyl group at C-3 and a hydroxymethyl unit at C-15, while 6 had a ketonic carbonyl at C-3. Their configurations were determined by NMR, NOESY, and ECD calculations. Biosynthetic pathways for all compounds were proposed, starting from farnesyl pyrophosphate. Anti-inflammatory screening showed only compounds 2 and 3 inhibited COX-2, with molecular docking revealing their binding sites. No antimicrobial or other bioactivities were observed.","Furacorane A (5), obtained as yellowish oil, assigned the molecular formula C15H26O3 on the basis of HRESIMS data, indicating three degrees of unsaturation. Its 13C NMR data (Table 3) disclosed an acorane skeleton, which was similar to daphneaine C. The presence of cyclopentane moiety of 5 was assigned by COSY correlations (measured in DMSO-d6) from H-1 through H2-2, H-3, and H-4 to H3-15, while the correlations from H-11 to H-1, H-12, and H-13 verified the presence of an isopropyl unit at C-1 (Figure 2). The COSY correlations from H-3 to 3-OH indicated the hydroxyl attached to C-3 in 5 instead of C-2 in daphneaine C. In addition, the methyl group at C-8 (CH3-15) in daphneaine C was replaced by a hydroxymethyl unit in compound 5, as supported by the chemical shift of C-15 moving downfield significantly to δC 61.5 (C-15), along with the observed COSY from the proton of 15-OH to H2-15 (Figure 2) and the long distance COSY from H2-15 to H-9 (allylic coupling, 4J) and from H-7 and H2-15 to H-10a and H-10b (high allylic coupling, 5J) (Figure S39). For the severe overlapping of some signals, the 1H NMR, HSQC and NOESY spectra of compound 5 were re-measured in CDCl3 (Figures S41–S43). The NOE correlations from H-1 to H-3 and H3-14 and from H-3 to H3-14 implied their cofacial orientation (Figure 4). H-10a (δH 2.06), H-6b (δH 1.20), and H-7 were assigned cofacial, as determined by NOE correlations from H-10a to H-6b and from H-6b to H-7. Thus, the relative configurations at cyclopentane unit were established. NOE correlations from H-10a to H-4 and H3-14, from H-10b to H-1, and from H-6b to H3-14 revealed the H-10a, H-4, H3-14, H-6b and H-7 located on the same side of the cyclopentane unit, while H-10b and H-1 were on the other side. The relative configuration of 5 was thus established as shown (Figure 4). To determine the absolute configuration, the specific rotation (SR) at the CAM-B3LYP/TZVP level was calculated (Tables S1–S3 in the Supplementary Data). The calculated SR value [α]D –22.6 for (1S,3S,4S,5R,7S)-5 was in agreement with the experimental value of 5 –18.2 (c 0.11, MeOH), which allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration of 5 as 1S, 3S, 4S, 5R, and 7S. Furacorane B (6) was also obtained as yellowish oil. Its molecular formula was determined as C15H24O2 on the basis of (+)-HRESIMS data, with one O-atom less and one more degree of unsaturation than that of 5. In the 13C NMR of 6, a resonance corresponding to a ketonic carbonyl at δC 220.5 (C-3) was observed, and the location of this carbonyl carbon was determined at C-3 by the detected HMBC correlations from H-2, H-4, and H3-14 to C-3 (Figure 2). The chemical shift of C-15 shifted from δC 61.5 in 5 to the upfield at δC 19.7 in 6, revealing the absence of -OH at C-15 (Table 3). Unfortunately, it is infeasible to determine the relative configuration by NOESY spectrum due to the special spiral ring system and the severe signal overlapping. The relative configuration of 6 was established the same as 5 owing to the same biosynthetic pathway. To further verify the absolute configuration of 6, ECD calculation was performed at the CAM-B3LYP/TZVP level in Gaussian 09. The experimental curve matched well with that of the calculated ECD spectrum for 1S, 4S, 5R, 7S-6 (Figure 5), both with positive Cotton effects around 295 nm. Thus, the absolute configuration of 6 was finally assigned as 1S, 4S, 5R, 7S. The biosynthetic relationship of all isolated compounds (1–6) biosynthesis of compounds 1–6 was proposed as shown in Figure S54. Briefly, the eremophilane sesquiterpene core (I) and acorenyl cation (XI), both derived from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), were considered as substrates to produce compounds 1–6 through a series of biochemical transformations, such as hydroxylation, isomerization, epoxidation, and acetylation. Cyclooxygenases 2 (COX-2) is involved in the key step of the converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which are considered as therapeutic targets for many inflammatory related diseases. Compounds with similar structures as described in the present work showed anti-inflammatory activities, so all of the isolated compounds (1–6) were screened for their anti-inflammatory activity at 100 µM towards COX-2 in vitro, among which, the eremophilane derivatives 2 and 3 were further assayed with concentration gradients and showed slight inhibitory effects with IC50 values 123.00 and 93.45 µM, respectively (Figure 6), whereas compounds 1 and 4–6 did not show any activities during the assays. Moreover, none of the isolated compounds showed any antimicrobial activities against agricultural pathogenic fungal strains Ceratobasidium cornigerum QDAU-6, Botrytis cinerea QDAU-23, Fusarium oxysporum QDAU-5, and aquatic pathogenic bacterial strains Escherichia coli EMBLC-1, Vibrio anguillarum QDIO-6, Vibrio harveyi QDIO-7. As well, the inhibitory activities against neuraminidase and angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) were also tested and no obvious activities were observed. A molecular docking study was performed to identify the intermolecular interaction and potential binding sites of the eremophilane derivatives 1–4 and the positive control celecoxib with COX-2 (PDB ID:5IKR) (Figure 7A). The results demonstrated that compound 3 interacted with COX-2 in the same active pocket with that of celecoxib (Figure 7D), which formed four key hydrogen bonds with residues Asn-43, Arg-44, and Cys-47, while celecoxib formed hydrogen bonds with residues His-39 and Gln-461 (Figure 7C,D). Hence, the huge variation of the inhibition activities might be implicated by their different nature of interactions with different residues of COX-2. In contrast, compound 2 was observed to form three hydrogen bonds with residues Arg-120 and Ala-527 (Figure 7B). The different locations of acetoxyl group in 2 and 3 exhibited great influence on the binding sites."

TA039229_C_0002,"The discussion highlights the structural uniqueness and bioactivity of the isolated sesquiterpenes, emphasizing the rare epoxyethane and tetrahydrofuran rings in compounds 2 and 3. These compounds showed COX-2 inhibitory activity, with molecular docking suggesting their binding to the same active pocket as celecoxib but with different residues, influencing their inhibitory effects. The acetyl group's position in 2 and 3 was critical for binding site interactions.","Six new sesquiterpenes, including four eremophilane derivatives, fureremophilanes A–D (1–4), and two acoranes, furacoranes A and B (5 and 6), were characterized from the culture extract of the cold-seep derived fungus Furcasterigmium furcatum CS-280 cultured on autoclaved P. aeruginosa QDIO-4.

The molecular docking experiment was carried out to explain their distinct activities. Compound 3 was considered to be engaged in the same active pocket with celecoxib, while the different binding residues lead to the difference in the inhibitory activities of COX-2 in vitro, and the different locations of acetyl group in 2 and 3 exhibited great influence on the binding sites."
TA036608_I_0001,"The study evaluates the immunomodulatory effects of budlein A, a sesquiterpene lactone from Aldama species, on innate and adaptive immune cells, focusing on neutrophils and lymphocytes.","The ability of the immune system to respond to a variety of stimuli is central to its function in pathogen clearance and tissue repair. The immune homeostasis and control of inflammation in different pathological settings is maintained by the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling, and most research has focused on understanding the mechanisms that regulate the immune response. New therapeutic agents are currently under investigation for pathological conditions in which the balance between activation and suppression of the immune response has failed. Studies have shown that plant-derived compounds have immunomodulatory effects without direct immunosuppressive action such as clinically used corticosteroids. However, the mere isolation of new naturally-occurring anti-inflammatory agents does not necessarily lead to a drug until the exact mechanism of action and their possible toxic effects are completely determined. Moreover, many biologically active compounds that do not afford a new drug or even a principal compound can be used as prototypes for the study of the mechanisms involved in a certain biological effect. Budlein A, a sesquiterpene lactone (SL) formerly isolated from the Central American species Aldama buddlejiformis (DC) and more recently from the South American A. robusta Gardner (Asteraceae), has been described as presenting anti-inflammatory activity. Recent studies have shown its anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities in mice. Although this information is important for determining its properties, it provides restricted parameters about how this compound affects other cells, adaptive immune response and T cell compartment. An immunomodulatory substance might show antibacterial activity, but the induced cell death could also be harmful to immune responses, pathogen clearance and tissue repair. In this context, research to develop new anti-inflammatory agents to control the damage and exacerbated inflammation mediated, in part, by lymphocyte activation, has been stimulated. Given the broad information relating SLs and immunomodulation, we should evaluate whether budlein A modulates the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells."
TA036608_M_0001,"The study involved the isolation and characterization of budlein A from the leaves of Viguiera robusta using spectrometric and chromatographic techniques. The purity of budlein A was confirmed to be between 95-98%. Peripheral blood was collected from healthy volunteers, and neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using density gradient centrifugation. Cells were cultured and treated with budlein A or dexamethasone, and their responses were analyzed using flow cytometry, ELISA, and MPO activity assays. Apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining.","Budlein A (MW=374.1365) was isolated from the leaves of Viguiera robusta, as previously described. Its chemical structure was determined by means of spectrometric analysis, i.e., IR, 1H, and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry as well as comparison with an authentic sample and data reported in literature. Analytical procedures using spectroscopy and chromatographic techniques indicated that the purity of budlein A used in this study ranged between 95-98%. Prior to the bioassays, budlein A was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (SIGMA – St. Louis, MO, USA) (0.1% in RPMI 1640 medium – GIBCO – Grand Island, NY, USA). We used peripheral blood from 30 healthy volunteers (17 men and 13 women; age ranged between 27-50 years). All subjects had no active diseases at the time of phlebotomy. All subjects signed an informed consent releasing the use of blood for research purposes approved by the Bauru School of Dentistry, University of São Paulo. Peripheral blood was harvested with heparin (50 U/ml) from healthy subjects. Both groups of leukocytes were layered over two different density Histopaque gradients (SIGMA) and centrifuged for 30 min at 450X g. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from the first layer (onto Histopaque 1077) and neutrophils were isolated from the second buffy coat layer (onto Histopaque 1119). Cells were then washed twice with Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) at 200 X g for 10 min before being quantified. Viability of the cells was >99% viable when assessed by Trypan blue exclusion."
TA036608_M_0002,"Neutrophils and PBMCs were cultured and treated with budlein A or dexamethasone under various conditions. Neutrophils were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP), while PBMCs were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). T cell proliferation was assessed using CFSE dilution and flow cytometry. Cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-β, IFN-γ) were measured using ELISA. MPO activity was determined by enzymatic reaction, and apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Tukey’s test.","Neutrophils (1x10/well) from healthy donors were cultured in 24-well plates, in presence of medium only, or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 ng/mL), N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP) (1.5 µM) in presence or absence of different concentrations of budlein A (1, 10 or 100 µM) or dexamethasone (100 µM). Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE) (Invitrogen – Eugene, OR, USA) labeled-PBMC (1x10/well) from healthy donors were cultured in 24-well plates, in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) (1 µg/ml) (SIGMA), or in presence or absence of different concentrations of budlein A (1, 10, or 100 µM) or dexamethasone (100 µM), at 37°C and 5% CO2. On day 4, the cells were harvested and the proliferative response of T cells was assessed by measuring the CFSE dilution using flow cytometry. The proliferation of T cells was characterized by sequential halving of CFSE fluorescence, generating equally spaced peaks on a logarithmic scale. The data represents the percentage of proliferation of T cells. The cell acquisition was performed on a FACSort flow cytometer using CellQuest software (BD Biosciencess – San Diego, CA, USA). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was determined by enzymatic reaction, as previously described. Neutrophils were harvested after culture and centrifuged at 350X g for 15 min, and the pellet was frozen at -20°C. The pellet was then liquefied and centrifuged twice at 10,000X g for 15 min at 4°C. The MPO activity in the suspended pellet was assayed by measuring the change in absorbance at 450 nm using tetramethylbenzidine (1.6 mM) and H2O2 (0.5 mM) (BD Biosciences). Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10, IL-12, Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β, and Interferon (IFN)-γ levels were measured using ELISA kits (BD Biosciences or R&D Systems – Minneapolis, MN, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested after culture and the viability was analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from the proportion of neutrophils, as well as lymphocyte positivity for Annexin- V-FITC or propidium iodide (ApoScreen™ Annexin V-FITC kit, SouthernBiotech – Birmingham, AL, USA), in relation to total number of cells. Values are presented as mean±SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s multiple comparison test (INSTAT Software; GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA, USA).

TA036608_R_0001,"The study evaluates the effects of budlein A on neutrophils, showing its concentration-dependent inhibition of MPO activity and cytokine production (IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10, IL-12) in both fMLP and LPS-stimulated neutrophils. Additionally, budlein A induces apoptosis in neutrophils at 100 µM.","To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of budlein A on neutrophils, cells were stimulated with fMLP or LPS in presence or absence of budlein A (1, 10, or 100 µM) or dexamethasone (positive control), and the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10, and IL-12 production and apoptosis were analyzed. Consistent with prior observation, budlein A inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the MPO activity by LPS-stimulated-neutrophils (Fig. 1A). Our results also indicate that at a concentration of 10 and 100µM, budlein A reduced MPO activity by fMLP-stimulated neutrophils (Figure 1A). Because neutrophils appear to be important producers of cytokines during innate immune response and cytokines are important mediators of the inflammatory process, we assessed whether budlein A affects cytokine and chemokine production by neutrophils (Figure 1B). Unstimulated neutrophils produced basal levels of IL-6, IL-10, CXCL8, and IL-12. Budlein A decreased CXCL8 production, induced IL-10 production and did not alter IL-12 and IL-6 production by unstimulated neutrophils. After 21 h of culture, LPS and fMLP enhanced IL-6, CXCL8, IL-12, and IL-10 production by human neutrophils. In contrast, budlein A inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner IL-6 and CXCL8 production by fMLP and LPS-stimulated neutrophils. Moreover, budlein A, at only 100 µM concentration, inhibited IL-10 and IL-12 production by fMLP and LPS-stimulated-neutrophils, while at 10 µM it inhibited IL-12 production by LPS-activated neutrophils (Figure 1B). To verify whether the results were the consequence of cell death, we analyzed the apoptosis of neutrophils. Our data showed that only budlein A at 100 µM concentration significantly induced neutrophil apoptosis (33.19±5.70%), similar to that observed after culture with dexamethasone (22.83±0.51%) (Figure 1C). Similar results were observed when fMLP or LPS-stimulated neutrophils were treated with budlein A (100 µM) (Figure 1C)."
TA036608_R_0002,"The study also examines budlein A's effects on lymphocytes, demonstrating its inhibition of PHA-induced proliferation and cytokine production (IL-2, IL-10, IFN-γ, TGF-β) without inducing apoptosis, indicating its immunomodulatory role without causing cell death.","To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of budlein A on lymphocytes, cells were cultured with PHA in presence or absence of budlein A (1, 10, or 100 µM) or dexamethasone (positive control), and proliferation, IL-2, IL-10, IFN-γ, and TGF-β production and apoptosis were analyzed. Lymphocytes exhibit proliferative response after PHA stimulation, and the addition of budlein A (100 µM) significantly reduced T cell proliferation (Figure 2A). These results indicate that budlein A interferes with PHA-induced T cell proliferation. Regarding cytokine production, the results evidenced that budlein A (100 µM) decreased IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β production by PHA-stimulated lymphocytes, with similar effects to dexamethasone (Figure 2B). Since budlein A negatively modulates the secretion of cytokines by PHA-stimulated lymphocytes, and this could be a consequence of cell death, their apoptosis was evaluated (Figure 2C). We found that budlein A (1, 10, or 100 µM) does not induce lymphocyte apoptosis (Figure 2C). These data indicate that budlein A exerts an important role against lymphocytes’ activation, but it did not induce cell death."
TA036608_D_0001,"The study investigates the immunomodulatory effects of budlein A on neutrophils and lymphocytes. Budlein A, a sesquiterpene lactone (SL) derived from Aldama species, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties. The research demonstrates that budlein A inhibits neutrophil activation by reducing MPO activity and cytokine production (IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10, IL-12) while inducing apoptosis at high concentrations (100 µM). In contrast, it inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production (IL-2, IL-10, TGF-β, IFN-γ) without causing cell death. These findings highlight its distinct effects on innate and adaptive immune cells.","Although budlein A has been described as presenting anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity, specific effects of this compound on immune cells are lacking. In the present study, we demonstrated that budlein A inhibit neutrophils activation and induce cell death, but, despite also inhibiting lymphocyte activation, it did not induce lymphocyte death. Budlein A inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the release of biochemical mediators by neutrophils, and this activity could possibly reduce tissue damage caused by the enzyme. The MPO activity can be deleterious to the host, and it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases. Myeloperoxidase has also been established as a risk factor for many forms of cancer via its ability to damage/mutate cellular DNA or indirectly via its pro-inﬂammatory role. The anti-inflammatory activity of SL is mediated via the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) by the alkylation of the cysteine residue in the p65 subunit, impairing its activation and the consequent production of inflammatory mediators. Another important effect of budlein A on neutrophils shown in this study was the inhibition of IL-6, CXCL-8, IL-10, and IL-12 production. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CXCL8, and IL-12) are involved in the initiation and amplification of the immune response, and anti-inflammatory cytokines modulate the late events to control the immune response. The imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine activities favors chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Imbalance in the production of inflammatory cytokines may allow a local inflammation to become an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response."
TA036608_D_0002,"The study further explores the mechanisms behind budlein A's effects on neutrophils and lymphocytes. At 100 µM, budlein A induces neutrophil apoptosis, potentially due to the inhibition of survival cytokines like CXCL8 or direct interference with neutrophil survival pathways. This apoptosis could be beneficial in chronic inflammatory diseases but harmful in acute infections. In contrast, budlein A does not induce lymphocyte apoptosis but significantly inhibits their proliferation and cytokine production (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-10, TGF-β), likely due to suppressed IL-2 levels. These findings suggest budlein A's potential as a selective immunomodulator for diseases involving uncontrolled immune activation.","Because low cytokine production might have occurred as a consequence of cytotoxic effects exerted by budlein A, we analyzed the apoptosis of human neutrophils. Only budlein A, at the 100 µM concentration, induces neutrophils apoptosis. The death of neutrophils observed in this study may be due to the absence of growth factors, particularly CXCL8, since budlein A, as well as other sesquiterpenes, inhibits activation of NF-κB and the production of cytokines related to neutrophil survival. In fact, 1 µM of budlein A did not significantly induce neutrophil apoptosis, but it did not significantly inhibit the production of CXCL8 either. Another possible explanation could be a direct influence of the substance in neutrophil survival. Death of neutrophil induced by budlein A could be harmful to immune response, pathogen clearance, and tissue repair. Neutrophils are involved with different inflammatory diseases and their apoptosis might generate an anti-inflammatory microenvironment as well. The precise regulation of neutrophil apoptosis is essential for resolution of inflammation, since this prevents the release of toxic intracellular components that can damage healthy tissues. Thus, anti-inflammatory agents that induced neutrophil apoptosis would only be helpful in some chronic inflammatory diseases, since these diseases present persistent inflammatory mediators avoiding their resolution. A plethora of those inflammatory mediators (i.e., the reactive oxygen species or neutrophil extracellular traps) is produced by viable neutrophils. These mediators could influence autoimmune diseases at different levels and by different ways, such as directly through the inhibition of cytokines, modulating their production or damaging surrounding tissues. Several diseases seem to be affected by activated neutrophils, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Hence, reduced numbers of activated neutrophils might generate a protected microenvironment from dramatic consequences from their uncontrolled inflammation. Interestingly, despite previous studies having shown that high concentrations of sesquiterpene lactones induced apoptosis of PBMC, we did not find any significant change in lymphocyte death using three different concentrations of budlein A. Budlein A at 100 µM significantly inhibited PHA-proliferation of lymphocytes as well as IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β production. Other studies have described a significant inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation via other sesquiterpenes; however, the viability rate of the cells had not been evaluated. Here, inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation might be a consequence of undetectable levels of IL-2, an important cytokine inducing lymphocyte proliferation. Thus, budlein A might be an important inhibitor of uncontrolled lymphocyte proliferation without inducing their apoptosis. Such situation would facilitate their use in diseases without directly affecting their survival. Therefore, our results also show that budlein A induced apoptosis of neutrophils but not lymphocytes, and indicate that budlein A shows distinct immunomodulatory effects on immune cells (Figure 3)."

TA036608_C_0002,The discussion emphasizes the therapeutic potential of budlein A in modulating immune responses. Its anti-inflammatory effects on neutrophils (inhibition of activation and induction of apoptosis) and lymphocytes (suppression of activation without cell death) suggest its utility in treating chronic inflammatory diseases. Further research is needed to explore how these dual effects can be balanced during immune responses to optimize therapeutic outcomes.,"Discussion: The anti-inflammatory activities mediated by budlein A reveal an important potential to the study of mechanisms of action and therapeutics. In the present study, we demonstrated that budlein A inhibits neutrophil activation and induces cell death, but, despite also inhibiting lymphocyte activation, it did not induce lymphocyte death. Further studies are necessary to understand the significance of this compound in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. It will be of interest to evaluate how the balance between these positive and negative effects could be regulated during the course of the immune response."
TA042038_I_0001,"The study introduces Panax ginseng as a widely used herb in Asian countries, emphasizing the need for systematic analysis of its active constituents, ginsenosides, due to their pharmacological significance, and highlights the limitations of current methods in comprehensively identifying these compounds.","Known as the king of herbs and a tonic, panax ginseng is widely used in Asian countries. With the development of evidence-based medicine and/or evidence-based pharmacy, analysis and identification of active constituents in panax ginseng are fundamental sciences needing to be addressed and systematically studied. Some modern research relevant to biological activities and pharmacological actions of panax ginseng have been reported, such as anti-tumor, improvement of immune function, regulation of central nervous system, protection effect on cerebral ischemia, anti-aging, etc. Based on a large number of published papers, the above-mentioned biological activities and pharmacological actions are all correlated with ginsenosides, a group of components that are regarded as the characteristic constituents of the roots and rhizomes of panax ginseng (RRPG), needing to be comprehensively analyzed.Until now, there are mainly two approaches for studies on chemical substances of ginsenosides from RRPG. One is the chemical separation method, in which ginsenoside monomer is obtained from the extract of RRPG through separation and purification technology, and its exact structure can be concluded according to its spectral data. However, some ginsenosides with minor amounts will be lost during the progress of separation, and usually ginsenosides with high amounts will be separated and characterized, leading to only a small part of ginsenosides being obtained from RRPG. For example, only eight ginsenosides were isolated from 75% ethanol extract of RRPG, whereas 28 ginsenosides were obtained from 70% ethanol extract of RRPG. Thus far, only about 53 ginsenosides were obtained from RRPG. The other approach is identifying ginsenosides based on liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Especially with the help of high-resolution mass spectrometry, we can obtain the accurate molecular weights of ginsenosides as well as their molecular formulas, which is of great significance for their accurate characterization, and their structures are deduced according to the obtained tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation ions. Moreover, ginsenosides with low contents or minor amounts can be characterized so long as we obtain their fragmentation information. This approach can help us to characterize much more ginsenosides in RRPG. For example, 95 ginsenosides were identified from dried fresh ginseng whereas 131 ginsenosides were tentatively assigned in RRPG using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode-array detector and quadrupole/time of flight tandem mass spectrometry. However, the identified ginsenosides through the above-mentioned two approaches were only a small part but not all in RRPG up to date. The main reason is that ginsenosides in RRPG own similar chemical structures and polarity leading to their poor separation in reversed-phase chromatographic column, even if in the optimized chromatographic conditions, it is difficult to achieve complete separation for many peaks and even some peaks are covered by others with high abundances. Moreover, during acquisition of their fragmentation ions, the auto-MS/MS mode is usually adopted, where precursor ions are selected according to their intensities, resulting in only compounds with high intensities having the chance to be characterized, whereas constituents with lower or much lower abundances miss being characterized because their precursor ions are not selected so their MS/MS spectra cannot be obtained. Thus, it can be seen that obtaining MS/MS spectra of much more ginsenosides during MS/MS acquisition is a crucial problem for the comprehensive identification of ginsenosides in RRPG. However, relatively few studies specially address the issues of improving acquisition of MS/MS spectra of much more ginsenosides in order to comprehensively characterize them. To solve this problem, molecular features of ginsenosides orienting precursor ions selection and targeted MS/MS analysis strategy was proposed in our study, and the precursor ions were selected according to the molecular features of ginsenosides irrespective of their peak abundances (as opposed to automatically fragmenting the most abundant signals). As a result, a total of 620 ginsenosides were successfully characterized in RRPG using this strategy."

TA042038_C_0002,"The discussion emphasizes the limitations of current ginsenoside isolation and the diversity of aglycones in RRPG. It also highlights the instability of malonyl-ginsenosides and the potential for discovering new ginsenosides, which could aid in traditional Chinese medicine formulations.","While there are many ginsenosides in RRPG, the ginsenosides currently isolated from it are just in part, which leads to the limitation of the cognition of ginsenosides for people. In our study, a strategy based on molecular features of ginsenosids orienting precursor ions selection and targeted MS/MS analysis was proposed to comprehensively identify ginsenosides in RRPG. The identified 620 ginsenosides confirmed the current cognition that ginsenosides in RRPG mainly existed in the forms of the known three types of protopanaxadiol, protopanaxatriol and oleanane. Furthermore, except for the known aglycones m/z 475, 459 and 455, our study proved that there were many more types of aglycones existing in RRPG, such as m/z 461, 443 as well as 441 for protopanaxadiol-type and m/z 509, 507, 493, 491, 489, 487, 477, 473 as well as 457 for protopanaxatriol-type, and the aglycones of protopanaxatriol-type were much more various than those of protopanaxadiol-type. Nevertheless, the oleanane-type ginsenosides were only with the aglycone m/z 455. Our study will help people to improve the cognition and understanding of ginsenosides in RRPG.It is worth noting that malonyl-ginsenosides are acidic saponins with strong polarity and are extremely easily hydrolyzed in the conditions of acid, alkali, hot water as well as hot methanol or ethanol to form corresponding ginsenosides by the loss of malonyl. Therefore, in order to retain the prototype of malonyl-ginsenosides, the powders of RRPG was extracted with 70% methanol at 25 °C so as to try to avoid the destabilized factor and finally much more malonyl-ginsenosides were detected, such as 108 malonyl-ginsenosides as well as 24 acetylation + malonylation ginsenosides were successfully identified.In addition, the unknown ginsenosides identified as the isomers, acetylations, malonylations, (E)-but-2-enoylations, acetylation + malonylation of the known ginsenosides as well as glycosylation of protopanaxadiol, glycosylation of protopanaxatriol, glycosylation of oleanolic aglycone are probably potential new compounds. For example, ginsenjilinol (R70) with aglycone m/z 491 was previously isolated as a new ginsenoside from RRPG by our research group and owned some certain anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, our study will play a guiding and reference role for the isolation and characterization of these potential new ginsenosides in RRPG. Besides, panax ginseng, which is a traditional Chinese medicine with clinical value and a tonic with nourishing effect, is often combined with other medicines forming many prescriptions to cure multiple diseases. However, panax ginseng is mainly used in the form of powers and it is directly mixed with the extracts of other medicines in these prescriptions, which leads to ginsenosides in the prescriptions just come from the involved single herb panax ginseng. Therefore, our study will also provide a reference for ginsenosides identification for traditional Chinese formulas containing panax ginseng."

Therefore, new solutions are being sought as alternatives to currently used agents. There are many new ideas and solutions, especially compounds of natural origin, including essential oils. In the present study, the antiprotozoal activity of a mixture of essential oils (eucalyptus, lavender, cedar and tea tree), organic acids (acetic acid, propionic acid and lactic acid) and metal ions (Cu, Zn, Mn) were tested. As a model, protozoans were selected: Euglena gracilis, Gregarina blattarum, Amoeba proteus, Paramecium caudatum, Pentatrichomonas hominis. The tested concentrations of mixtures were in the range of 0.001-1.5%. The analyses show unexpected, very strong protozoicidal activity of combinations, presenting the synergy of compounds via determination of LD(50) and LD(100) values. Obtained mixtures showed significantly higher activity against protozoans, compared to chloramphenicol and metronidazole. Most of the analyzed samples show high antiprotozoal activity at very low concentration, in the range of 0.001-0.009%. The most effective combinations for all analyzed protozoans were the cedar essential oil and tea tree essential oil with a mixture of acids and manganese or zinc ions. Innovative combinations of essential oils, organic acids and metal ions are characterized by very high antiprotozoal activity at low doses, which, after further investigation, can be applicable for control of protozoan pathogens."
TA043019_I_0002,"Infectious diseases caused by protozoa such as Plasmodium spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and Leishmania spp. are major global health threats, with current control methods including vector prevention, vaccination, and pharmacotherapy, though resistance and lack of new antibiotics necessitate alternative approaches like natural compounds.","Each year, more than 15 million people die worldwide due to infectious diseases caused by various pathogens including bacteria, protozoa, viruses or fungi. One of the main causes of death, besides bacterial and viral diseases, are diseases caused by protozoa such as Plasmodium spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma spp..The most deadly diseases caused by protozoa undoubtedly include malaria, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, sleeping sickness), Chagas disease, Visceral leishmaniasis (VL, kala azar), toxoplasmosis, Naegleriasis (PAM—primary amoebic meningoencephalitis), babesiosis or cryptosporidiosis. The most common signs of protozoan infection include diarrhea, fever, malaise or hepatosplenomegaly.Currently, there are three main methods of controlling protozoan parasites: prevention and containment of protozoan vectors, vaccination and antibiotic-based pharmacotherapy. Based on the example of malaria, we know that the primary and so far most effective weapon in the fight against parasitic protozoa is prevention and elimination of vectors, which are most often mosquitoes, ticks or bedbugs. To reduce the risk of infection, many international and national guidelines recommend the use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS) or both methods together. Moreover, control of vector abundance also contributes significantly to reduce the spread of pathogens. The most commonly used method of controlling protozoa is the use of pharmaceuticals. Most often, these are single active substances that show antimicrobial activity. These include nifurtimox, pentamidine, quinine sulfate, fexinidazoles, benznidazoles, artemisinin derivatives and chloroquine, among others. However, most of them have been marketed for completely different purposes and medical indications. Mixed therapies combining two or more pharmacological agents, for example, nifurtimox-eflornithine (NECT), artemether-lumefantrine or quinine sulfate with doxycycline, tetracycline or clindamycin are also commonly used to optimize effects.Mixed therapies are also a response to increasing resistance of microorganisms to available antibiotics. This is currently a significant problem that affects people all over the world. Its genesis is very complex and is influenced, among others, by high mobility and the possibility of movement all over the world, inadequate hygienic and sanitary conditions or the excessive use of antibiotics both in humans and animals. As mentioned above, reducing pathogenic protozoa, especially those showing resistance, is through combination therapy. However, without clinical trials using similar combinations, it is very difficult to estimate their cytotoxicity and interaction in the body.The lack of new and effective antibiotics causes the need for another alternative. This leads very often to developing an effective method to fight protozoa. The object of interest of researchers around the world are currently natural compounds extracted or obtained from plants. Compounds showing antimicrobial activity include phenolic compounds, terpenes, sulfur glycosides or alkaloids."
TA043019_I_0003,"Essential oils and their components, such as monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, exhibit strong antiprotozoal activity, while organic acids and metal ions also show antimicrobial properties, with the study focusing on their combined synergistic effects against protozoa.","Essential oils are characterized by a very high antimicrobial and antiprotozoal potential. They are volatile mixtures, most of which are scented, of various substances of mainly plant origin. They are obtained via steam distillation from various fragments of plant leaves, flowers, fruits, buds, bark, seeds and even roots. They are usually stored in glandulars. The growing interest in natural solutions, being an alternative to the currently used, generates new studies and reports in the literature. Papers or patents present that EOs are characterized by great antimicrobial potential. In vitro studies performed show very strong antiprotozoal activity of, e.g., tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia (Maiden & Betche) Cheel), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.), thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), catnip (Nepeta cataria L.), yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.), basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), Lippia sp., peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.). The current interest in natural alternatives to the available therapies is generating an increasing amount of scientific research. A growing number of studies are also investigating the antiprotozoal properties of individual components of essential oils, such as monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids as well as their alcohol, ester or ketone derivatives.Organic acids are commonly known compounds used in food, cosmetic, feed and pharmaceutical markets as acidifiers, stabilizers, acidity regulators or preservatives. The last feature has been used widely through the ages for food prevention. That property is mainly based on the lowering of the pH, which results in the inhibition of microbials. Organic acids show very good results in broilers and fish production, by their antibacterial and antiprotozoal properties.The combination of metals, e.g., iron, cobalt, nickel, gallium, copper, gold or silver with drugs are well known and very effective. Complex of Ru(II) chloroquine was one of the first tested antiprotozoal drugs combined with metal ions and showed a much better result than chloroquine itself. Other examples tested and evaluated for their antiprotozoal properties can be auranofin, triethylphosphine gold(I) chloride, cisplatin, 2-mercaptopyridine N-oxide complexes with Pt(II), Au(I) and Pd(II), or one of the most efficient for organometallic compounds, ferroquine. Moreover, not only do the combining synthetic drugs and metals have great potential. Natural compounds such as essential oils, alkaloids and phenols in combination with metal ions are also investigated by researchers.The mode of action of metal ions, mostly, is to impair the proper function of the cell membrane. They may be incorporated with the cell membrane, modulate ion channels, disrupt proton transfer or electrostatically interact with charges on the membrane surface. Metal ions can also affect various cell processes within cytoplasm such as inhibition of enzymes and proteins, catalyze the n of oxygen and hydroperoxide radicals and interrupt nutrient uptake.The aim of this study was to investigate antiprotozoal properties of an innovative mixture of essential oils (eucalyptus, lavender, cedar and tea tree), organic acids (acetic, propionic, lactic) and metal ions (Cu, Zn and Mn). Previous research and scientific papers showed antiprotozoal properties of all components, but there were no scientific data about the proposed combinations."

GC-MS analysis was employed to profile the essential oils, comparing mass spectra and retention indices with reference databases.","Five organisms representing the taxonomic groups to which the pathogenic protozoa belong were selected for in vitro studies of the antiprotozoal activity of the mixtures: Amoeba proteus—Chaos diffluens—a protozoan of the order Euamoebida, belonging to the phylum Amoebozoa, living in water. Paramecium caudatum—a paramecium representing aquatic ciliates. Gregarina blattarum—gregarines were isolated from cockroaches, representing the type Apicomplexa, living in the digestive tracts or body cavities of invertebrates. Euglena gracilis—a protozoan living in water, representing the flagellates—Mastigophora, family Euglenaceae. Pentatrichomonas hominis—a protozoan that lives in the human colon, representing the Trichomonadidae. The Amoeba, Paramecium and Euglena studied in this work were isolated from the freshwater river in Krosno (river Bado, 49°39’59.8’ N 21°46’28.1’ E, Krosno, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, Poland). Amoeba proteus was cultivated in the Prescott medium and was fed with ciliates, for example, Tetrahymena and Chilomonas. Paramecium was cultivated in hay infusion. Euglena was cultivated in solution according to Wu. Pentatrichomonas hominis was isolated from stool samples and kept in Pahm solution according to Chomicz et al. The gregarines were isolated from cockroaches and treated with the mixtures at different concentrations after being placed on a watch glass in Ringer’s solution. Each sample included ten individuals. The isolation of gregarine from cockroaches was carried out according to the method of isolation of gregarines from beetles proposed by J. Moraczewski. Amoeba, Paramecium and Euglena were observed microscopically on a watch glass with viscose wool fibers (to facilitate observation) in a drop of culture water, from which they originated. Different concentrations of the combinations were introduced into the test samples, establishing an LD50 dose (50% mortality) and an LD100 dose (100% mortality). For determining LD50, the Reed–Muench method was used. In all cases, four-fold replicates of the test were used along with a blank test. The lethal concentration of the substance LD50 and LD100 within 3 and 5 min was determined. Identification of individual protozoa was made on the basis of their descriptions and drawings after W. A. Dogiel and J. Hempel-Zawitkowska. The obtained mixtures of phytoncides with metals and single phytoncides were dissolved in an aqueous solution of polysorbate 80 (0.05%) before being applied to a watch glass. No biocidal effect of polysorbate 80 was observed at the above concentrations. Chloramphenicol and metronidazole were used as standard substances to control protozoa. Concentration of the antibiotics were 5 mg/mL and the dilutions were prepared from the stock to reach LD50 and LD100."
TA043019_M_0002,"Essential oils (eucalyptus, lavender, cedar, and tea tree) were sourced from commercial suppliers and combined with organic acids (acetic, propionic, lactic) and metal ions (Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺, Mn²⁺). The mixtures were heated until a color change occurred, cooled, and filtered. The resulting solutions were diluted to concentrations ranging from 0.001% to 1.5% for testing. GC-MS analysis was performed to profile the essential oils, using a Shimadzu 2020 apparatus with a Zebron ZB-5 MSI column. Mass spectra and retention indices were compared with the NIST20 database for identification. Statistical analysis, including ANOVA and Tukey’s test, was conducted using STATISTICA 13.3 to evaluate the significance of the results.","Essential oils were ordered from two companies. Eucalyptus and tea tree were purchased from Food Base Kft. (Gödöllő, Hungary), cedar essential oil from Synthite Industries Pvt., Ltd. (Kolenchery, Kerala, India) and lavender essential oil from De Monchy Aromatics Ltd. (Poole, Dorset, UK). Organic acids (acetic acid 99%, propionic acid 99.5% and lactic acid 85%) and other chemical reagents purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) comply with FCC and FG standards. The purity and percentage composition, according to the supplier’s specification, was minimum ≥95%. Essential oils (100 mL) were added in the same amount to organic acids (100 mL) or mixture of acids (ratio 1:1:1) and 5 g of copper (II) carbonate hydroxide (2.87 g of ions Cu2+) or 5 g zinc carbonate (2.61 g of ions Zn2+) or 5 g manganese (II) chloride (2.18 g of ions Mn2+). The entire mixture was heated until the color changed. The mixture was then allowed to cool to obtain a clear solution (one, two or three phases). After this time, the mixture was filtered through a paper filter. The combination was diluted: 1.5% to 0.001%; after that, the protozoa were placed in each dilution. The profile of the essential oils investigated was assessed using the GC-MS technique according to the protocol. Identification of all volatile constituents was based on comparison of experimentally obtained compound’s mass spectra with mass spectra available in the NIST20 database. Additionally, the retention indices (RI) obtained experimentally, calculated using macro, were compared with the RI available in the NIST20 database and the data from the literature. Shimadzu software GCMS Postrun Analysis (Shimadzu Company, Kyoto, Japan) and ACD/Spectrus Processor (Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) were used to process the data. The quantification of identified constituents was performed by calculation based on the amount of added internal standard and expressed as a percentage of integrated peaks’ area. Analysis was performed using the Shimadzu 2020 apparatus (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA) equipped with a Zebron ZB-5 MSI (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The temperature of the GC oven was programmed from 50 °C to 250 °C at a rate of 3.0 °C and kept for 3 min. Scanning was performed from 35 to 550 m/z in electronic impact (EI) at 70 eV and ion source temperature 250 °C. Samples were injected at split ratio 1:10 and gas helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The data, from LD50 and LD100 evaluation, were subjected to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Tukey’s test (p < 0.05) using the STATISTICA 13.3 software for Windows (StatSoft, Krakow, Poland)."

TA043019_R_0002,"The study evaluated 48 combinations of essential oils, organic acids, and metal ions for their antiprotozoal properties. The combination of tea tree essential oil, propionic acid, and manganese (TPMn) showed the highest efficacy, with an LD50 of 0.01%, surpassing reference antibiotics. Mixtures with manganese ions consistently performed best across all protozoan species. The lowest effective concentrations (0.001%) were observed for combinations involving tea tree or cedar oils with mixed acids and copper or manganese. The chemical composition of the essential oils was also analyzed, revealing key active compounds like linalyl acetate, eucalyptol, and terpineols.","In the study, antiprotozoal properties were analyzed for single components of the mixtures: 48 combinations (4 essential oils with 3 metals and 3 organic acids and their mixtures). All obtained combinations are presented in Table 1. Chloramphenicol and metronidazole were used as standard substances. The obtained results are presented in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8 and Table 9. They are characterized by variable efficiency depending on the combination used and the protozoan species. The combinations containing an essential oil, a single acid and one of the selected metals showed much stronger antiprotozoal properties than the single components, and in some cases, than the antibiotics used for comparison. Among these combinations, the combination of tea tree essential oil, with propionic acid and manganese (TPMn) showed the highest potential. TPMn showed LD50, at a very low amount—0.01%. That result is much better than the reference antibiotics—chloramphenicol and metronidazole. It was also observed that the strongest activity independently of the used oil was observed for propionic acid and manganese ions.The lowest antiprotozoal values against analyzed protozoa were obtained for innovative combinations of essential oil with the mixture of organic acids and selected metal. They showed an activity almost ten times stronger than that of analogous mixtures containing a single organic acid and an activity almost a hundred times stronger than that of single essential oils. Many of the proposed combinations showed activity against protozoa in the lowest tested concentration—0.001%. Most of the mixtures were very effective against Euglena gracilis. This protozoa was the most vulnerable form of all tested organisms. The concentration 0.001% was equal LD50 for 4 combinations, tea tree essential oil, mixture of acids and copper (TMCu); tea tree essential oil, mixture of acids and manganese (TMMn); cedar essential oil, mixture of acids and copper (CMCu); lavender essential oil, mixture of acids and manganese (LMMn). The highest concentration for the essential oil, mixture of acids and metal ions was obtained for the tea tree essential oil, mixture of acids and manganese (TMMn)—0.009%. Nevertheless, all the combinations with manganese ions showed the best results for all protozoans. However, it should be noted that the worst result for the combination of essential oil, mixture of acids and metal, is more than 10 times better than for the reference substance, which in this case is metronidazole. The values obtained for the remaining combinations were characterized by significantly lower effective doses than the reference substances, chloramphenicol or metronidazole. The mixtures with highest potential and lowest LD50 and LD100 values can be found in Table 10. Comparison between the most effective compositions, analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Tukey’s test, are presented in the Supplementary Materials.The chromatograms (presented in Supplementary Materials Figures S1–S4) show the chemical composition of the four essential oils used. Presented in Tables S1–S4 proves the typical mixtures for these essential oils’ composition. Predominated compounds for lavender EOs are linalyl acetate, linalool, 1-terpinen-4-ol and eucalyptol. In case of eucalyptus oil, 80.7% of the sum of the investigated compounds is an 1,8-cineol (eucalyptol) together with p-cymene 9.8%. Tea tree oil was rich in terpineols (mainly 1-terpinen-4-ol ~40%) with corresponding terpinenes (respectively γ–15.4% and α–9%). Finally, cedar oil was himachalene chemotype (β-isomer, 27.3% and α, with 9.1% content) together with sesquiterpenoic atlantone (isomer Z, 12.3% and trans-α 9.6%).Detailed composition of investigated EOs are presented in Tables S1–S4."

TA043019_D_0002,"The discussion elaborates on the novelty and efficacy of the tested combinations, emphasizing their food-safe components and synergy. Eucalyptus oil, though less studied for antiprotozoal activity, showed high efficacy in combination with acids and metal ions. Tea tree oil, known for antifungal and antiprotozoal properties, demonstrated exceptional activity at very low concentrations (0.001–0.004%). Cedar oil, with its broad antimicrobial properties, was 30–40 times more potent in mixtures. Lavender oil, while less documented for antiprotozoal effects, also performed well. The study underscores the need for further toxicity and efficacy testing but highlights the potential applications in medicine, pharmacy, and disease prophylaxis.","The results of the in vitro studies presented below confirm the antiprotozoal properties of blends which contained in their composition essential oils (eucalyptus, cedar, lavender or tea tree) with organic acids (acetic, propionic, lactic) and metal ions (Cu, Zn, Mn). The combination containing essential oils, organic acids and metal ions was a concept that occurred after several years of research on natural alternatives for antibiotics. Moreover, and what is very important, all of the used components are allowed to be used in food and feed. The idea corresponds strongly with the scientific results obtained by other researchers. Components used in this study were chosen by their antiprotozoal activity and different polarity. To the best of our knowledge, presented in this paper, combinations of EOs, acids and metal ions were tested for the first time. The object of investigations that have been conducted, are usually combinations of two or more essential oils, metals, antibiotics, organic acids, active compounds occurring in essential oil, essential oils with other compounds of natural origin or other compounds of plant origin e.g., alkaloids, triterpene saponins or chalcones and flavonoids. The proposed combination is characterized by innovation and, most importantly, high efficiency. Eucalyptus oil is very well known and used worldwide. Its properties have been widely described in the literature, with particular emphasis on antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. However, very little information can be found on its antiprotozoal activity. These properties were proved in the following study. Eucalyptus oil showed the same properties as the other tested combinations. It does not change the fact that its effectiveness in combination with acids and metal ions was very high at low concentrations. Another essential oil analyzed was tea tree essential oil. For years, it has not only been the subject of research, but also an ingredient in many antifungal products. It is also undoubtedly effective against Trichomonas vaginalis. A human trial showed that a dose of 0.4% tea tree essential oil was as effective as metronidazole treatment. Similar results were obtained in the following work. However, another study showed a 100% antiprotozoal efficacy of tea tree oil at 455 µL/L. Similar results were obtained in the following work. Baldissera et al. showed a much higher effective concentration, 1–2%, in their study. Other tests also showed its high antiprotozoal efficacy, but also high selectivity of the main component of tea tree oil—terpinen-4-ol. The composition containing tea tree oil, together with a mixture of organic acids and metal ions, had the best antiprotozoal properties among the combinations tested. It exhibited a mostly lethal effect, against 50% of the population, at concentrations in the range of 0.001–0.004%. Cedar essential oil shows very strong antibacterial, antiviral, insecticidal and antiprotozoal properties. Studies have shown that in its pure form, it has efficacy levels of LD50 = 0.04–1% and LD100 = 0.06–0.25% against analyzed protozoa. Obtained concentrations were very low. Unlike the C. deodara species, Cedrus libani did not show antiprotozoal properties against Leishmania major. Nisha et al. showed similar activity and effective concentration against the adult form of Setaria digitata. In their study, Kar et al. showed a significant enhancement of the effect of cedrol, one of the major components of cedar essential oil, as a cedrol-loaded nano-structured lipid carrier. In our studies, the combination of cedar oil with a mixture of acids and metal ions showed very good antiprotozoal properties in the range of 0.001–0.008% against the analyzed protozoa. Compared to the values obtained for cedar essential oil, it is 40 times and more than 30 times more potent, LD50 and LD100, respectively. Many studies present the high activity effects of lavender oil against microorganisms. However, there are few reports in the literature on its antiprotozoal activity. The results presented in this paper allow us to conclude that lavender oil, especially in the proposed combinations, show very good antiprotozoal properties. The values for pure lavender oil were promising, while the combinations performed only confirmed this. All analyzed variants of lavender essential oil, mixture of acids and Cu, Mn, Zn ions (LMCu, LMMn and LMZn) showed strong protozoicidal activity at the level of 0.001–0.008%. This article shows the very good antiprotozoal properties of the innovative combinations. The results obtained in this research are often even a hundred times stronger than those of standard antibiotics. It is necessary to conduct further tests with using the analyzed mixtures. The obligatory element is undoubtedly the analysis of the toxicity of the combination and its direct influence on organs, as well as accumulation in tissues. However, the mixtures obtained have a very high potential and can be used not only in medicine and pharmacy, but also in the prophylaxis of diseases caused by protozoa, both in humans and animals."

TA002243_I_0001,"The introduction provides an overview of terpenoids as the largest class of specialized secondary metabolites, their biosynthetic pathways (MVA and MEP), and the role of terpene synthases (TPSs) in converting precursors (GPP, FPP, GGPP) into monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes, highlighting the conserved motifs (DDxxD and NSD/DTE) critical for enzyme activity.","Terpenoids are the largest class of specialized secondary metabolites, which are widely distributed in nature with large quantities and diverse structures. Terpenoids form an essential part of direct and indirect defense systems against herbivores and pathogens. They are the derivatives of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are mainly produced by the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) and the plastidial 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathways in plants. The sequential head-to-tail condensation of IPP and DMAPP in the presence of prenyltransferases produces the immediate precursors of terpenes, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), which are converted into monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), and diterpenes (C20), respectively, by the activity of terpene synthases (TPSs). The structural analyses of TPSs show that a highly conserved aspartate-rich 'DDxxD' motif as well as another conserved 'NSD/DTE' motif is critical for binding and positioning the metal ion-substrate complex in the active site cavity."
TA002243_I_0002,"The introduction discusses the discovery of microbial terpene synthase-like proteins (MTPSLs) in nonseed land plants, their structural differences from typical plant TPSs (lacking β and γ domains), and their phylogenetic similarity to microbial TPSs, with a focus on the identification and initial characterization of 48 SmMTPSLs in Selaginella moellendorffii, which encode monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases.","In addition to the typical plant TPSs, a new type of microbial terpene synthase-like proteins (MTPSLs) has been found in previous studies, which occur widely in nonseed land plants. Compared with typical plant TPSs that consist of either three domains (αβγ) or two domains (αβ), MTPSLs contain only an α-domain. The MTPSL genes were initially identified in the genome of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii, from whose 48 MTPSL genes were identified. It was found that the genome of S. moellendorfii existed two kinds of TPS genes. The first kind was designated as S. moellendorffii TPS genes (SmTPSs), consisting of 18 members. The second kind was designated as S. moellendorffii microbial TPS-like genes (SmMTPSLs), consisting of 48 members. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that SmTPSs were very closely related to typical seed plant TPSs while SmMTPSLs were more similar to microbial TPSs, in particular fungal TPSs.

Despite increasing knowledge of the anatomical and biochemical processes of induced terpenoid defenses in S. moellendorffii, detailed molecular and biochemical dissection of these complex defense systems is currently limited by lack of identification and functional characterization of the SmMTPSL genes involved. Six SmMTPSL genes were characterized in a previous study. However, most SmMTPSL genes, their particular biochemical functions and their contribution to chemical defense remain to be discovered and functionally characterized. In the present study, we sequentially characterized another eight SmMTPSL genes to investigate their biological functions in nonseed plants. First, these eight full-length SmMTPSL genes were identified by analyzing the available genomic and transcriptomic resources from S. moellendorffii. Next, we analyzed the phylogenetic relatedness of eight SmMTPSL genes with other known MTPSLs. Furthermore, in vitro biochemical characterization were performed, suggesting that SmMTPSLs display monoterpene synthase and sesquiterpene synthase activities.

These enzymatic products were typical monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that have been previous shown to be generated by typical plant TPSs when provided with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrates. Meanwhile, SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 were up-regulated when induced by alamethicin (ALA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), suggesting a role for these genes in plants response to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, this study pointed out that the terpenoids products of SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 have an antibacterial effect on Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and Staphylococcus aureus. Taken together, these results provide more information about the catalytic and biochemical function of SmMTPSLs in S. moellendorffii plants."
TA002243_R_0002,"The fumigation assay demonstrated that Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil exhibits dose- and time-dependent toxicity against Sitophilus zeamais adults, with LC50 values decreasing over 72 hours. Terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol were the most potent constituents. The oil also inhibited key enzymes (AChE, GST, CarE) in S. zeamais, with effects peaking at 12–24 hours before partial recovery. RNA-Seq analysis revealed significant differential gene expression in fumigated insects, particularly in respiration-related and detoxification pathways, validated by qRT-PCR.","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais. The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed. To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C). A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes). To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil. To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable."
TA002243_D_0001,"The study characterizes eight microbial-type terpene synthase-like genes (SmMTPSLs) from Selaginella moellendorffii, highlighting their biochemical functions, phylogenetic relationships, and catalytic mechanisms. These enzymes exhibit monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase activities, with conserved motifs like 'DDxxD' and 'NSD/DTE' playing key roles in substrate binding and catalysis. Phylogenetic analysis links SmMTPSLs to fungal and bacterial TPSs, and molecular docking reveals critical amino acids involved in substrate binding. The enzymes are multi-product, with some producing multiple sesquiterpenes, and their expression is induced by stress-related compounds like methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and alamethicin (ALA).","In an attempt to identify genes of direct and putative indirect terpenoid defenses in *S. moellendorffii* and to provide a better foundation for phylogenetic analysis of the MTPSLs in nonseed plants family, eight full-length *SmMTPSL* genes were selected and functionally characterized from *S. moellendorffii*. The eight SmMTPSLs all contain two highly conserved motifs: 'DDxxD' and 'NSD/DTE' (Figure [1\)](#page-2-0). Most MTPSLs, like typical plant TPSs, harbor a canonical aspartate-rich motif: 'DDxxD'. The aspartate-rich motif functions in binding a cluster of three Mg2+ ions, which in term binds to the isoprenyl diphosphate substrates [\[24\]](#page-12-6). The binding leads to conformational changes of the active site, initiating the ionization and cyclization reaction. To the best of our knowledge, TPS function through divalent metal ion dependent generation of enzyme bound carbocation intermediates [\[25](#page-12-7)[–27\]](#page-12-8). The phylogenetic analysis showed that all SmMTPSLs clustered with four MTPSLs from ferns and were similar to TPSs found in fungi and bacteria, which were consistent with the conclusion in the previous literature [\[12,](#page-11-9)[14\]](#page-11-11). According to the docking result of SmMTPSL19 with FPP or GPP, the amino acids D93, K238, R321, K57, S53, and S98 were easy to form hydrogen bond with the ligand, making the binding of ligand and receptor more stable (Figure [3\)](#page-4-0). The remaining structure models and molecular docking also made clear that the other seven SmMTPSLs could successfully connect with the FPP or GPP. These models and molecular docking have painted a picture of some of the amino acids involved in the active sites of these SmMTPSLs and provided some level of confidence for modeling of SmMTPSLs, which will direct future experiments to analyze the involvement of these amino acids in catalysis. Through this, we hope to pinpoint amino acids involved in catalysis and provide a basis for future site directed mutagenesis of SmMTPSLs. As shown in our study, the eight SmMTPSLs were all determined to be functional, respectively, based on in vitro assays of the heterologously expressed proteins. All of them could use GPP or FPP as the substrate to display monoterpene synthase and sesquiterpene synthase activities (Figures [4](#page-5-0) and [5\)](#page-6-0). Like previously characterized MTPSLs from *S. moellendorffii* [\[12\]](#page-11-9), we note that all functional SmMTPSLs were also multi-product enzymes possessing sesquiterpene synthase activity in the present study. With some of them producing two or three sesquiterpenes, SmMTPSL15 appeared capable of producing as many as six sesquiterpenes. In this context, it is noteworthy that many typical plant TPSs are multi-product enzymes [\[28–](#page-12-9)[30\]](#page-12-10). Another interesting observation is that the product profiles of SmMTPSL5 and SmMTPSL33 share strong similarities and both produce farnesol and aromadendrene (Figure [5\)](#page-6-0). However, SmMTPSL5 and SmMTPSL33 share only 38% identity at the protein sequence level. It is thus an interesting question whether such similarity in catalytic activity reflects common ancestry or convergent evolution."
TA002243_D_0002,"The study demonstrates the role of SmMTPSLs in plant defense against abiotic stresses, as their expression is upregulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and alamethicin (ALA). SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 show significant induction, suggesting their involvement in stress response. Additionally, the terpenoid products of these enzymes exhibit antibacterial effects against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and Staphylococcus aureus, highlighting their potential in plant-pathogen interactions. Future research should explore individual and combined antimicrobial effects of these terpenoids.","Terpenoids play significant ecological roles in the interactions between plants and stress conditions. As the critical gene in terpenoid biosynthesis, the expression level of *TPS* genes in different plants under various stress conditions were widely reported [\[31](#page-12-11)[–34\]](#page-12-12). Both MeJA and ALA treatments regulated *SmMTPSL* genes expression (Figure [6\)](#page-7-0). The expression level of *SmMTPSL23*, *-33*, and *-37* were enhanced after the MeJA treatment with the most notable enhancement occurred to *SmMTPSL33* (13.5-fold) at 1.5 h, followed by *SmMTPSL37* (7.9-fold) at 3 h. Besides, the most remarkably up-regulation was found for *SmMTPSL23* (4-fold) at 6 h, followed by *SmMTPSL33* (5.1-fold) at 3 h after the ALA treatment (Figure [6\)](#page-7-0). The induction of *SmMTPSLs* expression in *S. moellendorffii* by MeJA or ALA supports that *TPS* genes play a role in defense against abiotic stresses. In addition, some genes shared the same induction alteration among two different treatments, suggesting that some genes may respond to the abiotic stresses in similar ways. The antimicrobial activity of a variety of terpenoids has been described earlier by several authors [\[19–](#page-12-3)[22](#page-12-4)[,35,](#page-12-13)[36\]](#page-12-14). The inhibitory effects of some pure terpenes and terpenoids on some bacteria and fungi for humans as well as phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi have already been reported. Based on the bacterial-inhibition assay [\[37–](#page-12-15)[40\]](#page-12-16), the present study pointed out that the enzymatic products of three SmMTPSLs (SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37) at the proper concentration reduced the growth of bacteria, especially against *S. aureus*, gram-positive bacteria (Figure [7\)](#page-7-1). This phenomenon made clear that terpenoids products act as a chemical defense against pathogenic infection and provide a chemical interpretation for the varied resistance or tolerance. It is worth remembering that the three SmMTPSLs are multi-product enzymes, so it will be significant to further evaluate the anti-bacterial effects of terpenoid compounds individually and in combinations. Moreover, other in vitro studies need to confirm the antimicrobial activity of such sesquiterpenes towards a larger number of strains, which may guide future efforts to characterize the anti-bacteria effect of terpenoid products in *S. moellendorffii.*"
TA036860_I_0001,"The introduction describes the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, highlighting the roles of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, microglia, and the interleukin-23/interleukin-17 axis in disease progression.","MS is a progressive autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which is mediated via various inflammatory cells and cytokines. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has been universally acknowledged as an animal model for MS, as it has similar clinical and neuropathological features. In MS/EAE, once activated, circulating T cells travel from the periphery to the CNS and generate large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Then microglia and invaded macrophages are consequently activated, and stimulate autoimmune reactions, leading to myelin damage. CD4+ T cells are the predominant cell type involved in the pathology of MS/EAE. Mice without functional CD4+ T cells do not develop the relevant clinical signs of disease. CD8+ T cells also accumulate and activate microglia to an extent, causing tissue damage during CNS autoimmunity. In the CNS, Mac-1 is expressed predominantly on the surface of resident microglia cells and infiltrating inflammatory macrophages, and therefore used to identify activated microglia/macrophages in EAE.The interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 axis performs important functions in MS pathogenesis. IL-23 is predominantly secreted from activated macrophages/microglia and dendritic cells, inducing Th0 cell differentiation into Th17 cells. This type of shift facilitates CNS inflammation and the development of EAE. Th17 cells are characterized by the secretion of IL-17. IL-23 and IL-17 in the serum and CNS have been reported to serve an important role in the pathology and immunotherapy of MS."
TA036860_I_0002,"The introduction discusses the limitations of current MS treatments and introduces Tanshinone IIA as a potential therapeutic agent due to its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, supported by its efficacy in other neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases.","MS is a debilitating disease with high disability and recurrence rates and there are over one million people worldwide suffering from the disease. The treatment of MS is limited to chemically synthesized immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive reagents, which are not always effective and are often associated with severe side-effects. Thus, the identification of more effective and safe agents is urgently required. Salvia miltiorrhiza, a Chinese herbal medicine, has traditionally been used to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA), its major bioactive constituent, has been shown to exert immunomodulatory effects on various immune cells and cytokines, with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and neuroprotective functions. TSIIA has been shown to exert a therapeutic effect in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. It has also been shown to be effective in inflammatory and autoimmunity diseases, including acute lung inflammation, sepsis and systemic sclerosis.Considering these findings, the present study examined the hypothesis that TSIIA can be effectively used for EAE treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that TSIIA alleviates EAE by downregulating the IL-23/IL-17 inflammatory pathway and reducing the infiltration of immune cell populations supporting its potential as an effective therapeutic agent for MS."
TA036860_M_0001,"The study utilized an EAE rat model induced by subcutaneous injection of guinea pig spinal cord homogenate mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra. Forty female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: naive (non-EAE), vehicle (EAE with solvent), and two TSIIA-treated groups (low and high doses). TSIIA or solvent was administered intraperitoneally daily from day 0 post-immunization. Body weight and clinical symptoms were monitored daily. On day 18, rats were sacrificed, and brain and spinal cord tissues were collected for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis.","With the approval of the Bioethics Committee of China Medical University, the EAE model was established by following standard universally accepted procedures. In brief, guinea pig spinal cord homogenate was mixed with same amount of CFA, which contained 5 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra. Each rat received a subcutaneous injection into the back and the hind footpads of 0.5 ml mixture to induce EAE. The day of immunization was regarded as Day 0 postimmunization (p.i.). Forty rats were separated at random into four groups. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (5 ml/kg) with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (5%) and Tween-80 (5%) was used as a drug solvent. Ten non-EAE rats that administered solvent intraperitoneally (i.p.) every day beginning from day 0 p.i. served as the naive group. Ten EAE rats administered i.p. injection of equal volume of solvent every day served as the vehicle group. In the last two groups, EAE was induced and rats were administered two different TSIIA concentrations i.p. TSIIA was dissolved in solvent at low (25 mg/kg; TSIIA-L group) and high (50 mg/kg; TSIIA-H group) concentrations, respectively. From day 0 p.i. the body weight of all rats was measured daily and clinical signs were also evaluated by two independent observers using the scale shown in Table I. On day 18 p.i., all the rats were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion of PBS (pH 7.4) through the left ventricle under anesthesia with injection of 10% chloral hydrate (3 ml/kg; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) into the abdominal cavity, and spinal cord and brain samples were obtained."
TA036860_M_0002,"Histopathological analysis included hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining of brain sections to assess inflammatory infiltration and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining of spinal cord sections to evaluate demyelination. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on brain and spinal cord sections using antibodies against CD4, CD8, Mac-1, IL-17, and IL-23, followed by detection with biotin-labeled secondary antibodies and DAB development. Western blotting was used to quantify protein expression levels of CD4, CD8, Mac-1, IL-17, and IL-23 in brain and spinal cord homogenates, with β-actin as a loading control. Serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23 were measured using ELISA kits. All analyses were performed blinded, and data were processed using Image-Pro Plus 6.0, ImageJ 1.36, and GraphPad PRISM 6.0 software.","Lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord and right-hand side of the brain were paraformaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Subsequently, 3-µm slices of brain were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) to evaluate inflammatory infiltration. In addition, 3-µm slices of spinal cord were sectioned and stained with LFB to evaluate demyelination. Histopathological assessment was performed in a blinded according to Table II. Slices (3 µm) of brain and spinal cord were used for immunohistochemical staining.

Biotin-labeled anti-rabbit IgG was used as a secondary antibody for the detection of primary antibodies. Color was developed with DAB. CD4-, CD8- and Mac-1-positive cells were counted under 400-fold magnification in the ventricornu of spinal cord sections. Expression of IL-23 and IL-17 was assessed based on the integral optical density (IOD) of positive cells under 200-fold magnification in a restricted area of brain sections. Five fields in the restricted area were randomly selected for calculations. All measurements and data analysis were performed independently by two pathologists in a blinded manner. Morphometric analysis was conducted using Image-Pro Plus 6.0. Brain and spinal cord from each group was respectively homogenized in lysis buffer with protease inhibitors and RIPA for protein extraction. Tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to obtain the supernatants. The BCA protein assay kit was used to measure protein concentrations. Protein samples (30 µg/well) were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 2 h at normal temperature, the membranes were separately incubated with rabbit anti-CD4 (diluted 1:500), rabbit anti-CD8 (diluted 1:500), rabbit anti-Mac-1 (diluted 1:300), rabbit anti-IL-17 (diluted 1:500), rabbit anti-IL-23 (diluted 1:500) and mouse anti-β-actin (diluted 1:1,000) overnight at 4°C. The following day, membranes were washed three times with TBST (5 min/wash), then were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary or goat anti-mouse secondary (diluted 1:2,000) antibody for 2 h. Following incubation, the membranes were washed three times with TBST (5 min/wash). Bands were treated with Luminol reagent for 1 min and visualized using the Electrophoresis Gel Imaging Analysis system. Band density was calculated via Image J 1.36 software. Protein bands were compared with that of β-actin to determine the relative expression level of target protein.

TA036860_R_0001,"The study investigated the therapeutic effects of Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA) on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats, a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). TSIIA treatment delayed the onset of EAE symptoms, reduced clinical scores, and mitigated weight loss in a dose-dependent manner. Pathological improvements included reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS).","Clinical signs of EAE development in rats from the vehicle group began to appear on day 9 p.i., including loss of appetite, reduced physical activity, and tail and limb paralysis. However, EAE onset in TSIIA-treated rats occurred on day 11 p.i. (TSIIA-H) and 10 p.i. (TSIIA-L). Compared with the vehicle group, the two TSIIA-treated groups received significantly lower clinical scores (P<0.01). Significant differences were also observed between the treated groups, which were dose-dependent (P<0.01; Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the body weights of untreated EAE rats were significantly decreased, compared with the naive and TSIIA-treated rats (all P<0.01) while those of TSIIA-treated groups were only marginally reduced, with the smallest recorded weight loss in the TSIIA-H group. Significant differences in body weight were observed between the two treatment groups (P<0.01; Fig. 1B). Since inflammatory cell invasion and CNS demyelination are the key characteristics of EAE, the impact of TSIIA on these parameters was verified. Consistent with clinical scores, rats in the vehicle group exhibited typical inflammatory cell infiltration in the brain, as determined via H&E staining. This cell infiltration was dose dependently attenuated following TSIIA treatment (Fig. 2A). Similarly, LFB staining revealed large areas of demyelination in the spinal cord of rats from the vehicle group, which were significantly decreased in the treated groups (both P<0.01; Fig. 2B). These results clearly indicate a beneficial effect of TSIIA in reducing inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination, which provide the basement of mitigated clinical signs following TSIIA treatment."
TA036860_R_0002,"TSIIA administration significantly reduced the infiltration of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and microglia in the CNS of EAE rats, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Additionally, TSIIA downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-23 in both brain tissue and serum, further supporting its anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects in EAE.","To identify the types of infiltrating cells in the CNS of EAE rats, immunohistochemistry was performed. Inflammatory exudates included a mixture of cell types, including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, microglia and macrophages (Fig. 3A–L). Compared with the vehicle group, TSIIA administration at the two doses induced a significant decrease in the quantity of CD4+ T cells (P<0.01), CD8+ T cells (P<0.01), macrophages and microglia (P<0.01) (Fig. 3M–O). The results were confirmed by quantification of the western blots and were consistent with the results of immunostaining (P<0.05; Fig. 4A, B and C). Expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-17 and IL-23, is usually increased in the CNS in EAE. To assess whether TSIIA exerts anti-inflammatory activity in EAE in vivo, its effects on IL-23 and IL-17 levels in the brain were determined using immunohistochemistry. Compared with the naive group, expression of IL-17 and IL-23 in the vehicle groups was significantly increased (P<0.01). Compared with the vehicle group, TSIIA treatment significantly induced a reduction in IL-17 and IL-23 expression (P<0.01). However, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups (P>0.05; Fig. 5). The effects of TSIIA on these indicators were further confirmed by quantitative western blot analysis (P<0.01), and significant differences were identified between the TSIIA-L and TSIIA-H groups in IL-17 (P<0.01) and IL-23 (P<0.05) expression (Fig. 4 A, E and F). The serum contents of IL-17 and IL-23 are usually upregulated and closely associated with the development of EAE. The highest concentrations of serum IL-17 and IL-23 among all groups were found in vehicle-treated rats, which decreased significantly in the two TSIIA-treated groups (P<0.01). The serum level of IL-17 in the TSIIA-H group was lower than that in the TSIIA-L group (P<0.01). However, no significant difference was identified in the serum concentrations of IL-23 between the two TSIIA-treated groups (Fig. 6)."

TSIIA, derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza, exhibits anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and neuroprotective properties. Results show that TSIIA treatment improves clinical symptoms and reduces pathological changes like CNS inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination. It also decreases CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages/microglia in the spinal cord and downregulates IL-17 and IL-23 levels in the brain and serum, suggesting its potential as a novel MS therapy.","Title: Tanshinone IIA attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats. Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune neurodegenerative disease, which features focal demyelination and inflammatory cell infiltration of the brain and the spinal cord. Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA), one of the major fat‑soluble components of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), has anti‑inflammatory, immunoregulatory and neuroprotective activity; however, its efficacy in MS remains unknown. The current study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic function of TSIIA on MS in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model. In comparison to the vehicle control group, the TSIIA‑treated groups showed notably improved clinical symptoms and pathological changes, including central nervous system inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination. Following administration of TSIIA, the quantity of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and macrophages/microglia in the spinal cord were reduced to different extents. Furthermore, TSIIA was also shown to downregulate interleukin (IL)‑17 and IL‑23 levels in the brain and serum of EAE rats. The results collectively provide evidence that TSIIA alleviates EAE and support its utility as a novel therapy for MS."
TA036860_D_0002,"The discussion elaborates on TSIIA's mechanisms in alleviating EAE, focusing on its effects on immune cells (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, macrophages/microglia) and the IL-17/IL-23 pathway. TSIIA reduces inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine production, mirroring effects seen with clinical MS treatments like natalizumab. It also suppresses microglial activation and macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines, mitigating CNS damage. The study highlights TSIIA's role in downregulating IL-17 and IL-23, key players in autoimmune pathology, and suggests its potential as a therapeutic agent for MS, though further clinical validation is needed.","Discussion: TSIIA has been shown to alleviate several CNS disorders in animal models, possibly through its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, the effects of TSIIA on EAE have not been determined to date. In the current study, an experimental model was established to determine the effects of TSIIA on EAE and its mechanisms of action. In MS and EAE, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages and resident microglia orchestrate a series of inflammatory reactions in the CNS of humans and animals, resulting in persistent disability. CD4+ cells are undoubtedly the pivotal pathogenic cells in MS and EAE that facilitate inflammatory reactions and subsequent neurodegeneration. These cells induce neuronal death under pathological conditions through a variety of mechanisms, such as triggering antigen-independent calcium oscillations and TRAIL-mediated injury in neurons. A number of therapeutic options that reduce the T cell- and particularly, CD4+ cell-mediated damage of neurons are extensively applied in the clinic. For example, natalizumab, an effective drug for MS, decreases the number of CD4+ cells in the brain and inhibits peripheral lymphocyte migration into the CNS. CD8+ T cells are also crucial in CNS autoimmunity. These cells are abundant in active demyelinating lesions in MS, and induce inflammation and demyelination in EAE. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between the degree of axonal injury and the quantity of CD8+ T cells as well as macrophages/microglia in the brain tissue from patients with MS, suggesting their important effects on axon loss. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells secrete various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including perforin and granzymes, which trigger autoimmune injury mediated by cells in the CNS. Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate, a water-soluble derivative of TSIIA, has been shown to markedly suppress the proliferation of spleen T lymphocytes and reduce the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell percentage in peripheral blood in a rat skin transplantation model. Additionally, TSIIA inhibits the maturation of dendritic cells and suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, weakening their capacity to stimulate T-cell proliferation. Data from the current study showed that TSIIA downregulates the increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the CNS and relieves clinical symptoms. Macrophages in the CNS are derived from peripheral monocytes, and microglia are resident macrophages. Once activated, microglia and macrophages cause mitochondrial dysfunction through induction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which contribute to axon injury and subsequent neuronal cell death. Activated microglia and macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhance sensitization of axons to glutamate, with subsequent initiation of an indirect immunological attack on oligodendrocytes and neurons. TSIIA reduces the release of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, from macrophages during inflammation. Microglial activation, a hallmark of CNS pathology in MS and other neurodegenerative diseases, triggers cytotoxic effects and drives neuronal damage, which can be suppressed by TSIIA in experimental models of SNL-induced neuropathic pain and Parkinson's disease. Macrophage depletion and microglial paralysis markedly alleviate disease progression. Consistently, compared with wild-type mice, Mac-1-deficient mice displayed attenuated EAE with lower levels of gliosis, axonal degeneration and demyelination. To the best of our knowledge, no studies regarding the impact of TSIIA on microglia/macrophages in CNS of EAE are have been conducted. The results from this study showed that following TSIIA treatment, microglia/macrophage numbers are decreased following decreased demyelination and inflammatory cell infiltration in the CNS of EAE rats. The IL-17/IL-23 pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, including MS, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. IL-23-deficient mice are unable to induce EAE. IL-23 is reported to promote polarization, development and expansion of pathogenic T cells; thus, it is essential for EAE induction. As a lineage of major pathogenic T cells, Th17 cells not only autosynthesize but also promote other types of cells to generate pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Th17 cells transmigrate efficiently across the blood brain barrier, damage neurons and contribute to CNS inflammation through CD4+ lymphocyte accumulation. Targeting IL-23-p19 with neutralizing antibodies has been shown to reduce the IL-17 level in the CNS and serum, which was also shown to prevent EAE relapse during disease remission. Serum IL-17 levels are positively correlated with disease severity and EAE is inhibited in IL-17−/− mice whose CD4+ T cells are incapable of inducing EAE efficiently, compared with wild-type T cells. IL-17 also stimulates microglia and astrocytes to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in recruitment of neutrophils. In collaboration with TNF-α, IL-17 promotes oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of oligodendrocytes, causing axonal loss and subsequent neurological deficits. In an earlier phase II clinical trial, following treatment with secukinumab, an antibody that neutralizes IL-17, MS patients displayed fewer new CNS lesions observed using magnetic resonance imaging, and lower annualized recurrence rates, compared with placebo-treated patients. Therefore, blockage of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in the clinical treatment of MS has recently received considerable research attention, in view of accumulating data highlighting its vital role in MS/EAE. TSIIA has been shown to inhibit IL-17-induced vascular remodeling in systemic sclerosis patients. However, no research to date has investigated the impact of TSIIA on IL-17 and IL-23 levels in EAE/MS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a significant decrease in serum and brain expression of IL-17 and IL-23 in EAE following TSIIA treatment. In conclusion, this study provides preliminary evidence supporting the use of TSIIA as a potential novel therapeutic option for MS. However, rats in this study were only treated acutely, and the feasibility and safety of TSIIA require validation in the clinic."
TA019138_I_0001,"The introduction discusses the impact of abiotic stress on crops, the role of metabolomics in understanding plant stress responses, and the function of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in enhancing drought tolerance through metabolic processes, including terpenoid regulation.","Crops are often subjected to abiotic stresses in the process of the growth and development, while abiotic stress also activates relevant functional genes and metabolic pathways to mitigate the stress damage of crops. Plant stress regulation is a complex network, and it is difficult to fully analyze the responsive mechanisms of plants to stress by studying a single gene or metabolic pathway alone. Metabolomics is a powerful tool to assess the whole change of organisms at the metabolite level and also is essential for understanding the chemical signals during plant growth and development. In the analysis of metabolomics, metabolites are small molecules that are formed and/or altered during metabolisms, and changes of metabolite profiles can establish a close relationship between genotype and phenotype and also reveal the plant–environment interaction comprehensively and systematically. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), subphylum Glomeromycotina of the phylum Mucoromycota, are the most widely distributed mycorrhizal fungi in soil, and can colonize the root of host plants to establish arbuscular mycorrhizal symbionts. Mycorrhizal fungi establish a well-developed network of extraradical mycelium outside the root system, which is directly involved in water and nutrient uptake and therefore responds to various environmental stresses including drought. AMF-induced enhancement of drought tolerance is involved in many metabolic processes, such as proline, indoleacetic acid, polyamines, fatty acids, aquaporins, antioxidant defense system, H+ -ATPase, rhizospheric microenvironment, and so on. Metabolomics analysis has been applied to reveal mycorrhiza-associated metabolite changes following AMF inoculation. However, very few studies have attempted to use metabolomics tool to analyze metabolite changes caused by AMF inoculation under abiotic stress (e.g., drought and salinity) conditions. For example, Yang et al. revealed that under saline conditions, inoculation with Rhizophagus intraradices induced changes in amino acids, organic acids, flavonoids, sterols, and hormones in Puccinellia tenuiflora plants to improve osmoregulation, maintain cell membrane stability, and enhance antioxidant systems. In wheat, Funneliformis mosseae mainly triggered sugars, lipids, and oleuropein lactones involved in stress mechanisms under drought stress. These limited studies still revealed that arbuscular mycorrhizal symbionts responded to stress by regulating metabolic plasticity."
TA019138_I_0002,"The introduction highlights the ecological and biological importance of terpenoids in plant stress responses, their regulation by AMF under drought conditions, and the need for metabolomics to understand these changes, particularly in drought-sensitive crops like citrus.","Terpenoids are the most diverse and widely distributed class of secondary metabolites present in plants. Terpenoids are volatile, serve as mediators of communication between plants and other organisms, and are biologically and ecologically important for the plants' own reproduction and defense. They guarantee the survival of plants in stressed environments by performing several functions, such as protecting plant tissues from pathogens or herbivores and helping reproduction by attracting pollinators or seed dispersers. Severe drought dramatically increased total monoterpenes and resin acids in Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies seedlings. In an aromatic plant Tanacetum vulgare, root terpenoids were obviously induced by drought, and such increase in root terpenoids would serve as more storage of resources for regrowth. Earlier studies have shown that secondary metabolites of many hosts such as terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids were regulated by AMF inoculation under drought conditions. In P. tenuiflora seedlings, AMF inoculation under saline conditions significantly altered the relative concentrations of various metabolites, including amino acids, amines, carbohydrates, polyols, phytohormone, steroids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, flavonoids, organic acids, but terpenoids were not reported. However, in two wheat cultivars, F. mosseae caused the change of terpenoids, along with the up-regulation of a limonene-1,2-diol and (20S)-ginsenoside Rh2 and the down-regulation of both 7-deoxyloganate and hemigossypol-6-methyl ether. Kaur and Suseela reviewed the changes in primary and secondary metabolites of plants induced by mycorrhizal fungi and concluded that host terpene metabolism is specific to the host-associated AMF and terpene species. It was shown that sesquiterpenoid cyclohexenone derivatives could be induced to increase by Glomus intraradices in the member of Poaceae, but sesquiterpenoid cyclohexenone glycoside was not induced by AMF under biotic and abiotic stresses. Various volatile terpenoids in host plants were also induced by AMF, resulting in an increased emission of these compounds in response to the environment. It seems that terpenoids could be regulated by AMF inoculation under stress. Because of the wide variety of terpenoids, metabolomics is the way to clearly outline the response pattern for mycorrhizal inoculation under drought conditions, while how mycorrhizas respond to drought through changes of terpenoid profile is unclear. The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyze the changes in the metabolome of citrus (a drought-sensitive industrial crop) by AMF inoculation under soil well-watered and soil drought stress through non-targeted metabolomics, with a focus on the response of terpenoids in the differential metabolites to reveal the mechanisms by which mycorrhizas enhance plant drought tolerance."
TA019138_M_0001,"The study employed a combination of biological and analytical techniques to investigate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on trifoliate orange seedlings under drought stress. The methods included the preparation and application of AMF inoculum, establishment of drought stress conditions, assessment of root colonization, and comprehensive metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Data were analyzed using multivariate statistical methods to identify differential metabolites and metabolic pathways.","The mycorrhizal fungal strain (FLR12, Myke®PRO) was provided by the Premier Tech Ltd. (Quebec, Canada), which is a company for the production of commercial mycorrhizal inoculants. The Myke FLR12 strain of R. intraradices was designed for the improved growth of annuals and perennials and also presented positive effects on plant growth performance of trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf., a citrus rootstock; [Cheng et al., 2019](#page-9-16)). The purchased fungal strain was proliferated by employing white clover as the host plant in pots under the condition of 900 μmol/m2 /s photo density, 28°C/20°C day/night temperatures, and 68% relative air humidity. After 3 months, the white clover plants were harvested, the aboveground parts were removed, and the roots and potting substrates were collected. The roots were cut, mixed well with the growth substrate, dried naturally for 5 days, and collected as mycorrhizal fungal inoculum. Thus, the mycorrhizal inoculum contained AMF-colonized root segments, spores, sporocarps, and mycorrhizal mycelium. Harvested inocula were kept at 4°C for a maximum of 4 months. Prior to the application of AMF inocula, we used sucrose gradient centrifugation ([Brundrett et al., 1994](#page-9-17)) to isolate spores in the inocula and observed 19 spores/g inoculum. A 22 experimental design was used for this experiment. One factor was AMF inoculations with and without R. intraradices; the other factor was soil water regimes, including well-watered (75% of maximum field water holding capacity) and drought stress (55% of maximum field water holding capacity). As a result, there were four treatments in the experiment: the non-inoculated seedlings (non-AMF) under well-watered, the inoculated seedlings (AMF) under well-watered, the non-inoculated seedlings under drought stress, and the inoculated seedlings under drought stress. Each treatment was replicated 8 times, with a total of 32 pots. Trifoliate orange seeds were sterilized by 75% alcohol solutions for 5min, rinsed with distilled water three times, and germinated in sterile sand in an incubator at 28°C/20°C day/night temperature and relative air humidity of 80%. When the seedlings developed four leaves, the seedlings were transplanted into a 2.3-L plastic pot pre-filled with 2.8kg of autoclaved mixture with soil and sand (1:1, v:v). At transplanting, 100g of mycorrhizal fungal inoculums was applied into the pot as the AMF treatment, and the non-AMF treatment was correspondingly mixed with an equal amount of autoclaved mycorrhizal inocula. After transplanting, these seedlings were exposed to the condition of 900μmol/m2 /s photo density, 28°C/20°C day/night temperatures, and 68% relative air humidity and also grew in soil well-watered regime for 11weeks before soil drought treatment. 3days prior to soil drought stress, selected pots were stopped from watering and allowed to reach the designed soil moisture content for drought stress. Subsequently, half of the inoculated and non-inoculated plants were subjected to soil drought stress treatment for 9weeks, and the remaining plants were still grown under soil well-watered regime conditions for 9 weeks. The reduced water of pots was supplemented by weighing daily at 18:00pm. This study was conducted for 20weeks. At harvest plants were divided into shoots and roots, weighted and frozen with liquid nitrogen and immediately stored at−80°C for subsequent analysis. Five 1-cm-long root segments were cut from each plant, cleared in 10% KOH solution at 95°C for 1.5h, and stained with 0.05% trypan blue in lactophenol ([Phillips and Hayman,](#page-10-12) [1970\)](#page-10-12). The arbuscular mycorrhizal structure of roots was observed under a light microscope, and the root mycorrhizal colonization rate was estimated according to the following formula: Extraction of Metabolome Samples Root tissues were vacuum freeze-dried, and the dried samples were ground into a homogenous powder. Subsequently, 100mg of the powder was extracted with 70% methanol at 4°C overnight, vortexing and shaking three times during the extracted process. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000×g/min for 10min, and the supernatant was filtered through a microporous membrane (0.22μm), followed by LC–MS/MS analysis."
TA019138_M_0002,"The metabolomic analysis involved the use of advanced chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques to identify and quantify metabolites in trifoliate orange roots. The study utilized UPLC and MS/MS for high-resolution separation and detection of metabolites, followed by data processing using multivariate statistical methods.

In the triple quadrupole, each ion pair was scanned and detected according to the optimized declustering potential and collision energy. The assay data were analyzed and processed using the Analyst 1.6.3 (AB Sciex, Foster, California, United States) software.

After obtaining the metabolite spectra for each sample, the peak areas of the mass spectra of all substances were integrated and corrected for the mass spectra of the same metabolite in different samples. The data were formatted in logarithmic transformation plus centralization using a SIMCA software (V14.1, Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB, Umea, Sweden) and then analyzed by automated modeling ([Wiklund et al., 2008](#page-10-13)). Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out by SIMCA-P software (Umetrics AB, Kinnelon, NJ, United States). The statistical method of orthogonal projections to latent structuresdiscriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was utilized to analyze the results of metabolites and to obtain more credible information about the correlation between metabolite group differences and experimental comparison groups. The OPLS-DA modeling analysis was performed on the first principal component. The validity of the model was assessed by the RY (interpretability of the model for categorical variable Y) and Q (predictability of the model) obtained after cross-validation. By considering the results of both multivariate and univariate statistical analysis methods, we observed the data from different perspectives and draw conclusions, in order to avoid false positive errors or model overfitting caused by using only one type of statistical analysis method. The differential metabolites were defined as per the Student's t-test at p<0.05, along with >1 of the variable importance in the projection of the first principal component of the OPLS-DA model.

TA019138_R_0002,"The study evaluated the fumigant toxicity of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil against Sitophilus zeamais adults, showing dose- and time-dependent mortality. The LC50 values decreased over time, with terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol being the most potent constituents. The oil also inhibited key enzymes (AChE, GST, CarE) in S. zeamais, with effects peaking at 12-24 hours. RNA-Seq analysis revealed significant gene expression changes, particularly in respiration and xenobiotic metabolism pathways, suggesting metabolic disruption in S. zeamais after fumigation.","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais. The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed. To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C). A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes). To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil. To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable."

TA019138_D_0002,"The discussion emphasizes the growth-promoting effects of AMF under both normal and drought conditions, with a stronger impact under drought.

Our study also confirmed that *R*. *intraradices* strongly promoted shoot and root biomass production in trifoliate orange regardless of soil moisture content, and the promoting effect was relatively higher under drought conditions than under well-watered conditions. [Zhang et al. \(2018\)](#page-10-14) used a device to separate mycorrhizal extraradical hyphae from inoculated trifoliate orange rhizosphere for quantitative estimation of hyphal water absorption rate and found that the hyphal water absorption rate was much higher under soil moisture-limited conditions than under soil moisture-sufficient conditions. This suggests that the improved plant growth of AMF is more important on arid soil than on saturated soil and therefore more attention needs to be paid to mycorrhizas in arid zones ([Allen, 2006\)](#page-9-19). Metabolomic analyses implied changes in root metabolites of trifoliate orange seedlings in response to AMF inoculation. Among them, in non-inoculated plants, 50 differential metabolites were identified and metabolites were predominantly downregulated. Similarly, in quinoa (without AMF inoculation; *Chenopodium quinoa*), drought stress triggered 60 differential metabolites, 53 of which were down-regulated [\(Shi et al., 2020](#page-10-15)); in tall fescue (*Festuca arundinacea*), drought stress caused 282 differential metabolites, 148 of which were down-regulated [\(Li](#page-9-1)  [et al., 2017](#page-9-1)). However, in the inoculated trifoliate orange plants, 76 differential metabolites were identified, and these metabolites were predominantly up-regulated by drought stress. This result implied an elevated number of differential metabolites and a reversal of the metabolite response pattern from down-regulation (non-inoculated plants) to up-regulation (inoculated plants). <span id=""page-7-0""></span>![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg) ![](_page_7_Figure_3.jpeg) In the analysis of differential metabolite pathway, droughtinduced differential metabolites of non-inoculated plants and inoculated plants were annotated to 14 and 31 metabolic pathways, respectively. Among them, non-inoculated plants were dominated by amino acid (e.g., L-glutamic acid) metabolism and inoculated plants were dominated by sugars and amino acids (e.g., L-aspartic acid), showing the different metabolic responses of both. Thus, inoculated plants have stronger metabolic activity in response to drought stress than non-inoculated plants by means of predominant up-regulation, further indicating a higher drought tolerance potential of mycorrhizal plants versus non-mycorrhizal plants. In addition, the presence of mycorrhizal symbionts strongly stimulated the changes of metabolites in roots of trifoliate orange under well-watered and drought stress, showing, respectively, 210 and 105 differential metabolites, which were predominantly down-regulated under well-watered and up-regulated under soil drought. [Yang et al. \(2020\)](#page-10-8) also reported more up-regulated differential metabolites of *P*. *tenuiflora* seedlings under salinity after inoculation with *R*. *intraradices*. The annotated pathways of these differential metabolites were inconsistent in response to AMF inoculation under well-watered and drought stress, indicating different response mechanisms of mycorrhizal fungi promoting plants under different soil moisture conditions. Among the metabolic pathways, amino acids responded more effectively because they are the basic units of protein synthesis, and changes in them affect protein synthesis and thus interfere with normal physiological metabolism [\(Yang et al., 2020](#page-10-8)). AMF induced the increase in 17 amino acids (2-aminoadipic acid (L-homoglutamic acid), N-acetylmethionine, 3-(6-hydroxy-3,4-dioxo-1,5 cyclohexadien-1-yl)-L-alanine, L-glutamic acid, guanidineacetic acid (−)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methylalanine, S-(5ʹadenosy)-L-homocysteine, L-pipecolic acid, L-glutamine, L-methionine methyl ester, L-alanine, N-acetyl-L-tyrosine, | Comparison of treatments       | Terpenoids      | Category | KEEG ID | Ionization model | p-value | VIP  | Fold change | |--------------------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|------------------|---------|------|-------------| | DS vs. WW in non-AMF seedlings | Phytol          | Terpene  | C01389  | [M-H]-           | 0.039   | 1.70 | 2.62↑       | |                                | Capsanthin      | Terpene  | C08584  | [M+H]+           | 0.034   | 1.55 | 0.76↓       | |                                | β-Caryophyllene | Terpene  | C09629  | [M+H]+           | 0.038   | 1.61 | 0.58↓       | |                                | α-Terpineol     | Terpene  | C16772  | [M+H]+           | 0.014   | 1.66 | 0.71↓       | | DS vs. WW in AMF seedlings     | Sweroside       | Terene   | C17071  | [M+H]+           | 0.027   | 1.57 | 1.63↑       | | AMF vs. non-AMF under WW       | Limonin         | Terpene  | C03514  | [M+H]+           | 0.003   | 1.39 | 0.52↓       | |                                | Roseoside       | Terpene  | –       | [M+H]+           | 0.002   | 1.32 | 0.17↓       | |                                | Sweroside       | Terpene  | C17071  | [M+H]+           | 0.008   | 1.39 | 0.38↓       | |                                | Albiflorin      | Terpene  | C17457  | [M+H]+           | 0.014   | 1.30 | 0.50↓       | |                                | (−)-Camphor     | Terpene  | C00809  | [M+H]+           | 0.025   | 1.21 | 0.79↓       | |                                | Capsanthin      | Terpene  | C08584  | [M+H]+           | 0.027   | 1.22 | 0.80↓       | |                                | Artemisinin     | Terpene  | C09538  | [M+H]+           | 0.032   | 1.21 | 0.61↓       | |                                | α-Terpineol     | Terpene  | C16772  | [M+H]+           | 0.008   | 1.29 | 0.70↓       | | AMF vs. non-AMF under DS       | Phytol          | Terpene  | C01389  | [M-H]-           | 0.034   | 1.53 | 0.38↓       | |                                | β-Caryophyllene | Terpene  | C09629  | [M+H]+           | 0.001   | 1.60 | 1.78↑       | <span id=""page-8-0""></span>TABLE 1 | Changes in relative concentration and fold changes of terpenoids in differential metabolites in roots of trifoliate orange under well-watered (WW) and drought stress (DS) after AMF inoculation. ↑ *and* ↓ *indicate that the variable is increased or decreased.* N-acetylaspartate, phenylalanine-phenylalanine, S-(5ʹ-adenosyl)- L-methionine, 3-hydroxy-3-methylpentane-1,5-dioic acid, and glutamic acid) and derivatives and the reduction of 3 amino acids and derivatives (3-(2-naphthyl)-D-alanine, aspartic acidphenylalanine, and L-cysteine) under drought stress conditions. [Bernardo et al. \(2019\)](#page-9-4) also identified 10 differential amino acids in drought-stressed wheat after AMF inoculation, 7 of which (4-amino-2-methyl-5-phosphomethylpyrimidine, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, imidazole acetol-phosphate, penicillamine, L-methionine/S-ethyl-L-cysteine, O-phospho-L-tyrosine, and 3ʹ-deamino-3ʹ-oxonicotianamine) were up-regulated, and three amino acids (2-amino-3-oxobutanoate, N-acetyl-DL-methionine, and cyclogutamate) were down-regulated. In *P*. *tenuiflora* seedlings subjected to saline stress, AMF inoculation positively promoted the accumulation of 10 amino acids and amines [\(Yang et al.,](#page-10-8) [2020](#page-10-8)). [Salvioli et al. \(2012\)](#page-10-16) revealed the increase in the amino acid abundance in tomato fruits after inoculation with *G*. *mosseae.* In white clover, *R*. *intraradices* accelerated leaf glutamate, aspartate, arginine, and ornithine concentrations, which was associated with changes in N-assimilated enzyme activities [\(Xie et al.,](#page-10-17) [2021](#page-10-17)). Mycorrhizal symbiosis accelerated the uptake of various amino acids in *Sorghum bicolor* such as phenylalanine, asparagine, arginine, tryptophan, etc., and the uptake of such neutral or positively charged amino acids was higher than that of negatively charged amino acids [\(Whiteside et al., 2012](#page-10-18)). In addition, the increase in amino acids under mycorrhization may originate from the synthesis of mycorrhizal fungi [\(Govindarajulu et al.,](#page-9-20) [2005](#page-9-20)). More amino acids were accumulated in mycorrhizal plants after stress, implying more protein synthesis under adversity. This facilitates mycorrhizalized plants to further improve osmoregulation, maintain cytoplasmic membrane permeability and nutrients, and thus enhance the response to stress signals [\(Teixeira et al., 2020\)](#page-10-19). Soil drought strongly affected the terpenoid content of plants, usually showing an increasing trend in total terpenes ([Turtola](#page-10-10) [et al., 2003;](#page-10-10) [Jiang, 2012\)](#page-9-11). In our study, drought stress induced a significant accumulation of phytol in roots of non-inoculated plants as well as sweroside in inoculated plants, while inhibited the decrease in capsanthin, caryophyllene, and terpineol on non-inoculated plants. Similarly, [Podda et al. \(2019\)](#page-10-20) also revealed the increase in phytol in *Brassica oleracea* plants in response to drought stress. It seems that phytol, a product of chlorophyll degradation, served as an important indicator of the state of chlorophyll. Other studies in *C*. *aurantium*, *Eucalyptus camaldulensis*, and *Thymus transcaucasicus* showed diverse changes in metabolites under environmental stresses (drought, salinity, and temperature stresses) conditions, along with the reduction of metabolites more commonly [\(Eirini et al., 2017;](#page-9-21) [Manukyan, 2019;](#page-10-21) [Amrutha et al., 2021\)](#page-9-22). Thus, these metabolite changes are an adaptive response mechanism in trifoliate orange under drought stress. The results of the present study showed that AMF inoculation significantly inhibited the relative concentrations of various differential metabolites in almost all cases, except for β-caryophyllene which was increased. [Bernardo et al. \(2019\)](#page-9-4) also reported the increase of two terpenoids (a limonene-1,2 doil and (20S)-ginsenoside Rh2) and the reduction of another terpenoids (7-deoxyloganate and hemigossypol-6-methyl ether) in wheat plants under drought stress after the colonization by *F*. *mosseae*. We speculated that mycorrhizal plants possessed more biomass including roots than non-mycorrhizal plants, so there was a dilution effect, which led to the decrease in differential metabolites. Additionally, mycorrhizal fungi may have promoted effects on the amount of volatilization and release of terpenoids under drought conditions. Many terpenes are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and a small number of studies also displayed that mycorrhizal fungal colonization increased the emission of the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate from *Plantago lanceolata* [\(Fontana et al., 2009](#page-9-15)) and the emission of limonene and artemisia ketone from *Artemisia annua* [\(Rapparini et al., 2007](#page-10-11)). The emission of these terpenoids is almost comparable to the mechanical damage and herbivore damage to plants. These suggest that mycorrhiza-induced reduction of terpenoids may lead to an increased emission of VOCs. VOCs are an indirect way for plants to attract natural enemies to defend against insect herbivores as well as for VOCs to play a signal to initiate plant defense response ([Fontana](#page-9-15)  [et al., 2009\)](#page-9-15). More work needs to be carried out around the changes in the emission of VOCs by mycorrhizal versus non-mycorrhizal plants under adversity. Our results also displayed that AMF inoculation significantly reduced the relative concentration of phytol in roots of trifoliate orange under drought stress, but not under well-watered. In fact, in the process of abiotic stress, a certain amount of chlorophyll is disintegrated, leading to a substantial accumulation of free phytol [\(Podda et al., 2019](#page-10-20)). [Zhang et al. \(2020\)](#page-10-22) also found significantly higher chlorophyll levels in drought-stressed trifoliate orange after inoculation with *F*. *mosseae*. This implies that mycorrhizal plants have a higher chlorophyll content and therefore reduced phytol levels under drought conditions. It concludes that mycorrhizal plants under drought stress are characterized with a low level of chlorophyll degradation and thus maintain a relatively high accumulation of photosynthates, which is positive for the drought tolerance of plants."
TA042860_I_0001,"The introduction discusses the impact of oxidative stress on albumin in type 2 diabetes mellitus, highlighting the role of free radicals in altering albumin's structure and function, and the importance of antioxidants like astaxanthin in maintaining protein stability.","The accumulation of oxidative stress in biological systems causes a variety of health issues in humans. Oxidative stress is caused by free radicals that exceed the defense capacity of human cells. One of the oxidative effects generated by free radicals is a change in albumin protein structure in type 2 diabetic patients. Albumin is a protein that is immediately influenced by an increase in blood free radicals. This problem impairs albumin’s ability to serve as a scavenger and transporter. One of albumin’s functions, as a scavenger, is metal ion binding; as previously stated, heme possesses pro-oxidant qualities, and albumin is an effective protein in heme binding. When heme is linked with albumin, the pro-oxidant characteristics decrease, indicating that albumin functions as an antioxidant. Albumin has also been shown to bind numerous metal ions such as Cu2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Fe3+ and Mn3+ with active residues as Cys34. The oxidative stress target in albumin is site 2, and it is also shown that modification or removal of cysteine residue will expose human serum albumin (HSA) to be easily degraded. Our previous studies showed that glycated human serum albumin (gHSA) had an unfolding event in molecular dynamic simulation within 15,000 ps. The unfolding also causes the detachment of side chains A and B in gHSA. Changes in albumin’s secondary structure have an influence on blood rheology on a larger scale. One of the most important aspects of blood rheology is viscosity. Internal friction causes viscosity change, which is a measure of flow resistance. Blood viscosity is higher in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients due to red blood cell aggregation and impaired deformability. Microangiopathy and macroangiopathy are two types of blood vessel narrowing caused by diabetes. Slower blood and erythrocyte flow result from a combination of capillary shrinkage and increased blood viscosity. Antioxidants are required by the body of T2DM patients to counteract protein unfolding and preserve the stability of proteins damaged by free radicals. Antioxidants play a critical function in electron balance under oxidative stress situations. This is because antioxidants may serve as both donors and acceptors of electrons. ASX, one of the lipophilic terpene substances with a polyene chain, is one of the carotene group’s antioxidants with a strong potential as an antioxidant. Free radicals can be stabilized by this chain. As a radical scavenger, ASX employs a number of reactions, including radical adduct, hydrogen atom transfer and single electron transfer. ASX treatment in gHSA and HSA has previously been proven to maintain protein structure until the endpoint of molecular dynamics simulation. The finding is confirmed by data from the backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) and movie visualization. ASX is a carotenoid which can interact with a wide range of systems. ASX has two adjacent oxygen atoms in the form of hydroxyl groups and a keto group on the cyclohexane ring. Due to the existence of this oxygen atoms, ASX molecules can coordinate metal ions. The structure of cyclohexane is similar to hydroxyl quinones, which have high biological activity, including the formation of chelation complexes with transition metal ions. Density functional theory analysis and molecular dynamic simulations showed that ASX, in the complex form with transition metal ions such as Cu2+ and Zn2+, has greater antioxidant capacity than ASX in the not complexed form."
TA042860_I_0002,"The study employs various experimental and computational methods to investigate the interaction of astaxanthin and its metal ion complexes with HSA and gHSA, aiming to understand their role in protein stability and blood viscosity reduction.","In this research, the capacity of ASX and ASX-metal ion complexed with gHSA and HSA acting as antioxidants at different doses has been investigated. There has never been any research on the management of diabetes mellitus from the standpoint of albumin and ASX, as well as ASX-metal ions. Furthermore, CD spectroscopy has been used for time dependent investigation to monitor changes in the secondary structure of HSA and gHSA following interaction with astaxanthin. New data are also shown for antioxidant activity determination by EPR spectroscopy, rheology measurements, UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis, particle size and zeta potential studies, as well as in silico approach. The purpose of this research is to determine the ability of the ASX and ASX-metal ions in maintaining protein structure as well as reduce viscosity levels in both gHSA and HSA."
TA042860_M_0001,"The study employed a combination of experimental and computational techniques to investigate the interaction of astaxanthin (ASX) and its metal ion complexes (with Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺) with human serum albumin (HSA) and glycated human serum albumin (gHSA). Experimental methods included UV-Vis spectrophotometry to analyze absorption spectra, viscometry to measure relative viscosity, circular dichroism spectroscopy to assess secondary structure changes, zeta potential and particle size analysis to evaluate colloidal stability, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to confirm complex formation. The DPPH assay was used to measure antioxidant activity. Computational approaches involved molecular modeling using Avogadro for geometry optimization, Gaussian09 for electronic structure calculations, and AutoDock Vina for molecular docking to predict binding interactions.","Astaxanthin (SML0982, CAS No 472-61-7), human serum albumin (HSA) and glycated human serum albumin (gHSA), CuCl₂·2H₂O, ZnCl₂, absolute ethanol, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich. Astaxanthin stock solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg in 100 mL ethanol (0.167 mM). Solutions with different astaxanthin concentrations, as native (6 × 10⁻¹¹ mM) and as metal complexes with Cu²⁺ (1 μM and 3 μM) and Zn²⁺ (1 μM, 3 μM and 20 μM), were prepared. The UV-Vis experiments were performed using a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer Lambda 900/Perkin Elmer Instruments (Norwalk, CT, USA). Measurements were performed by using the simple capillary tube viscometer method. The spectropolarimeter used was a J-815 model (Jasco). The zeta potential and particle size analysis of each sample were measured with a Zetasizer Nano-ZS90 (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). EPR measurements were performed with a Bruker E580 Elexsys Series spectrometer. For antioxidant analysis, the 2,2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was chosen.

TA042860_R_0001,"The study investigates the interaction between glycated human serum albumin (gHSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) with astaxanthin (ASX) and ASX-metal ion complexes (Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺). Glycation in diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) alters albumin's structure, reducing its scavenging and transport functions. ASX and its metal complexes were found to stabilize gHSA and HSA, preventing unfolding. Techniques like UV-Vis spectroscopy, EPR, CD spectroscopy, rheology, and computational methods (MEP, molecular docking) were used to analyze these interactions. Results show that ASX-metal complexes enhance antioxidant activity and protein stability compared to native ASX.","Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by a variation in albumin protein structure caused by oxidative stress. In this context, the interaction between gHSA/HSA and a strong antioxidant compound as ASX, was evaluated. Furthermore, to increase the complex capacity and the antioxidant activity of astaxanthin, the addition of metal ions such as Cu2+ and Zn2+ was studied. In Figure 1A the UV-Vis spectra of HSA (black line) and gHSA (red line) are reported. Comparing the spectra of HSA and gHSA, an increase in absorbance was observed for the latter. The increase in the absorbance peak of gHSA was attributed to the change in the secondary structure of the protein due to the formation of Amadori product occurring between glycation agents with the HSA lysines. In Figure 1B, the UV-Vis spectra of ASX dissolved in EtOH at different concentrations, with the absorbance peak at 486 nm, is reported. Furthermore, in Figure 1C the UV-Vis spectra of HSA/gHSA-ASX complexes have been carried out. The presence of the peak at 486 nm is due to the presence of free astaxanthin which is not present in samples 7 and 8 (see the inset in Figure 1C). The UV-Vis analysis, performed in the presence of ASX and ASX metal complexes with HSA and gHSA, show the absence of free astaxanthin (see Figure 1D,E). This points out that the presence of metal ions favors a complete complexation of ASX with the protein. Furthermore, in all the spectra of HSA and gHSA complexed with ASX and ASX-metal ions, an absorbance decrease in the region of 200 nm was observed compared to the free forms, due to the conformational change of the protein. These results confirm the complexation of ASX and ASX-metal ions with HSA/gHSA. Previous studies on the bovine serum albumin (BSA) complex for reaction with different antioxidants reported similar results. A decrease in the absorbance peak, when the antioxidants were complexed with glycated albumin, was detected. The decrease in absorbance values is also supported by CD data, where a change in the secondary structure of the protein was observed during incubation time."
TA042860_R_0002,"EPR spectroscopy confirmed the complexation of ASX with Cu²⁺ and its interaction with HSA/gHSA, showing axial geometry and coordination with oxygen/nitrogen atoms. The DPPH assay demonstrated enhanced antioxidant activity of ASX-metal complexes, with ASX-Cu (3:1) showing the highest scavenging activity (62.9%). MEP analysis revealed changes in electrostatic properties of ASX upon metal binding, improving its reactivity. CD spectroscopy indicated stabilization of albumin secondary structures by ASX and its metal complexes, particularly in gHSA. Viscosity and zeta potential analyses showed that ASX-metal complexes reduce gHSA viscosity and improve protein stability. Molecular docking highlighted stronger binding of ASX-metal complexes to gHSA, with lower binding energies supporting their efficacy.","EPR spectroscopy has been applied to investigate the Cu2+ complexation ability of ASX, gHSA-ASX-Cu and HSA-ASX-Cu as well as the antioxidant activity through the in vitro assay of 2,2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). In Figure 2A, low-temperature (150 K) EPR spectra of ASX-Cu in the 1:1, 1:2 and 3:1 molar ratios are reported. The figure shows the typical line shape of Cu2+-complexes in an axial geometry with defined parallel and perpendicular regions. These data confirm the ability of ASX to complex copper ion. From the analysis of the parallel region of the EPR spectra, the presence of the two copper isotopes is evident, due to the slight splitting of the single lines. For all the spectra, the inhomogeneous broadening of the lines and the experimental magnetic parameters, g║ = 2.425 ± 0.002 and A║ = 11.0 ± 0.2 mT, are typical for copper complexes with 4O atoms in the coordination sphere, as it is also confirmed by the Blumberg and Peisach diagram. The assignment of Cu–O bonds in the EPR spectra is in agreement with a previous study on UV-Vis and FTIR of ASX-metal ions complex. In Figure 2B, low-temperature (150 K) EPR spectra of HSA+ASX-Cu and gHSA+ASX-Cu in the molar ratios 1:1, 1:2 and 3:1 are reported. The figure shows the typical line shape of Cu2+-complexes in an axial geometry, but the presence of coordinated nitrogen atoms cannot be ruled out. It is evident from the broadening of the parallel components of the spectra compared with the ones reported in Figure 2A. The magnetic parameters for these spectra are g║ = 2.363 ± 0.002 and A║ = 15.4 ± 0.2 mT supporting a 1N3O coordination. For comparison, the EPR spectra of Cu2+ with HSA and gHSA were recorded (Figure S1 red and blue lines respectively) showing the complexation ability of the protein. These EPR data clearly show that stable complexes can be formed by the interaction of ASX-Cu with HSA and gHSA at all the tested molar ratios. This result strongly supports the initial theory and results for CD analysis that the addition of ASX and ASX-metal ions, in this case Cu2+, can maintain the stability of HSA and gHSA proteins. The same findings, regarding the ability of albumin to bind Cu2+, were also investigated by Sciortino et al.. In prion proteins (PrPc), complexes with Cu2+ are also found in the 'octarepeat' regions and show the same pattern when Cu2+ binds to the N-terminal of the protein. The antioxidant activity of ASX and ASX-metal ions was tested by EPR using the DPPH assay (Figure 3). In Figure 3 the percentage of the scavenging activity of ASX and ASX plus metal ions Cu2+ or Zn2+ at different molar ratios is reported. In the inset, the room temperature EPR spectrum of the DPPH radical is shown. It is characterised by five lines due to the hyperfine interaction of the unpaired electron with the two magnetically equivalent N atoms present in the structure. The figure shows that at the same concentration of 0.5 μM, free astaxanthin has a scavenging activity of 4.8% compared to 62.9% of ASX-Cu complex (3:1) and 55.2% of ASX-Zn (1:2). It was found that the ratio (3:1) is the optimal concentration for ASX-Cu complex showing the higher percentage of scavenging activity when compared to the other ratios. This is in agreement with Marin et al., who demonstrated that the addition of metal ions to ASX increased its antioxidant activity."
TA042860_R_0003,"The study concludes that ASX and ASX-metal ion complexes (Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺) effectively stabilize gHSA and HSA, preventing structural degradation in T2DM. ASX-metal complexes exhibit superior antioxidant activity and binding affinity, reducing gHSA viscosity and improving protein stability. Computational and experimental data align, showing that metal ions enhance ASX's efficacy. These findings suggest potential therapeutic applications for ASX-metal complexes in managing diabetes-related albumin dysfunction.","Many complications in DMT2 patients are related to increases in the blood viscosity. To allow albumin to work properly, viscosity should be decreased, especially for gHSA. In this context, viscosity analysis was performed for HSA and gHSA in the presence of ASX and ASX-metal ions. The viscosity analysis showed a viscosity reduction in gHSA due to the presence of ASX and ASX complex with Cu2+ and Zn2+ (Figure 7). An important role was played by the concentration of ASX, because ASX in little concentration reduced the viscosity of HSA and gHSA of 34% and 8%, respectively, while higher concentrations (3 and 20 μM) affected viscosity of gHSA, increasing to 144.80% and 154.25%. Adding metal ions such as Cu2+ and Zn2+, the viscosity of gHSA decreased while the viscosity value for HSA increased. ASX-Cu2+ (3:1) complexed with gHSA for 7 days showed a decrease in viscosity of 27.22%. Meanwhile, for ASX-Zn2+ (20 µM:20 µM) as much as 25% of complex compound (1.5 mL (ASX-Zn2+) + 4.5 mL PBS) was able to reduce gHSA viscosity by 19.38%. In conclusion, ASX at low concentration (6 × 10−11 mM) could be used to reduce the viscosity of HSA; but considering that for DMT2 patients, a decrease in the viscosity of gHSA is essential, the use of ASX-metal ions could be relevant. The particle size analysis (Table 1) shows the increase in size for gHSA and HSA proteins complexed with astaxanthin, due to the formation of aggregates in the form of fibrils A higher zeta potential value in gHSA (−14.6 mV) has been found compared to normal HSA (−10.0 mV). This happened because arginine and lysine residues were major sites for glycation. When this modification occurred, it was followed by an increase in negative charge and a decrease in the isoelectric point of the protein. A higher hydrophobicity for the glycated protein due to protein conformational changes, including partial unfolding, will result. Then, when HSA and gHSA were complexed with ASX, the zeta potential value for the two proteins was smaller, namely HSA-ASX (−2.88 mV) and gHSA-ASX (−4.82 mV). However, when compared with the ASX-metal ion complexes, the ability of ASX in energy stabilization was better, especially for gHSA, where for ASX-Cu2+ (−8.58 mV) and ASX-Zn2+ (−10.1 mV). The main objective of zeta potential analysis is to detect a lower zeta potential while retaining a good conductivity value in the chemical complex of ASX with gHSA. The decrease in zeta potential value was also followed by an increase in conductivity where gHSA + ASX (5.58 mS/cm), gHSA + ASX (5.11 mS/cm) and gHSA + ASX (3.35 mS/cm) became 7.61 mS/cm (gHSA + ASX-Zn) and 6.58 mS/cm (gHSA + ASX-Cu). This shows that metal ions-ASX complex is able to provide a better protective effect than native ASX on the protein albumin structure. This is supported by the study of Hang Ma et al. where gBSA before treatment had a zeta potential value of −106.3 mV and when given PGG (gallotannin) decreased to −30.9 mV. The data showed decreased zeta potential for all ASX and ASX-metal ions + HSA/gHSA complexes. However, when compared to ASX, ASX-metal ions perform much better in terms of maintaining conductivity in the sample, so we can conclude from zeta potential and conductivity data that the addition of metal ions to ASX can improve astaxanthin’s ability to carry out energy stabilization in the HSA or gHSA complexes."
TA042860_C_0001,"The study investigates the effects of astaxanthin (ASX) and its metal ion complexes (Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺) on human serum albumin (HSA) and glycated human serum albumin (gHSA). Glycation in T2DM patients reduces HSA's functionality as a scavenger and transporter. ASX and its metal complexes were found to stabilize gHSA, preventing unfolding and improving protein stability. Various analytical techniques, including EPR spectroscopy, rheology, CD spectroscopy, and computational methods, were employed to confirm these findings. The addition of metal ions enhanced ASX's antioxidant properties and improved protein stability.","Title: Quantification and Improvement of the Dynamics of Human Serum Albumin and Glycated Human Serum Albumin with Astaxanthin/Astaxanthin-Metal Ion Complexes: Physico-Chemical and Computational Approaches. Abstract: Glycated human serum albumin (gHSA) undergoes conformational changes and unfolding events caused by free radicals. The glycation process results in a reduced ability of albumin to act as an endogenous scavenger and transporter protein in diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) patients. Astaxanthin (ASX) in native form and complexed with metal ions (Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺) has been shown to prevent gHSA from experiencing unfolding events. Furthermore, it improves protein stability of gHSA and human serum albumin (HSA) as it is shown through molecular dynamics studies. In this study, the ASX/ASX-metal ion complexes were reacted with both HSA/gHSA and analyzed with electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, rheology and zeta sizer (particle size and zeta potential) analysis, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectrophotometer measurements, as well as molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and molecular docking calculations. The addition of metal ions to ASX improves its ability to act as an antioxidant and both ASX or ASX-metal ion complexes maintain HSA and gHSA stability while performing their functions."
TA042860_C_0002,"For the first time, EPR data confirmed the complexation of ASX with Cu²⁺. The study demonstrated the antioxidant properties of ASX and its metal complexes using DPPH assays and MEP analysis. ASX and its metal complexes improved gHSA's transporter and scavenger functions, normalizing viscosity and zeta potential. CD spectroscopy showed that ASX-metal complexes maintained gHSA's secondary structure stability over seven days. Molecular docking revealed optimal binding energies for ASX-Cu²⁺ (3:1) and ASX-Zn²⁺ (1:2), aligning with antioxidant and stability data. Overall, metal ions enhanced ASX's antioxidant capacity and supported HSA/gHSA stability.","Discussion: For the first time ever, EPR data were obtained reporting the complexation of ASX with metal ion (Cu²⁺). Its relationship with HSA and gHSA, as well as the ability of ASX/ASX-metal ions (Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺) as antioxidants, showed by 2,2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and MEP analysis, was reported. With the addition of ASX/ASX-metal ions, the ability of gHSA (an essential marker in T2DM patients) as a transporter and endogenous scavenger improved protein rheology, decreasing viscosity and zeta potential close to normal albumin values. CD spectroscopy also confirmed that ASX and ASX-metal ion complexes prevent damage to gHSA by maintaining the stability of the secondary structures from D-0 until D-7. It was also observed that ASX-metal ions improved the stability of gHSA more than ASX alone. The docking data confirm that the best binding energy is for ASX-Cu²⁺ (3:1) and ASX-Zn²⁺ (1:2); it is also in line with the antioxidant data and CD spectroscopy, which show that the above ratios are the best in maintaining the stability of albumin protein, both native and glycated. Overall, adding metal ions to astaxanthin increase astaxanthin’s ability as an antioxidant and help to maintain the stability of HSA and gHSA in carrying out its functions."
TA045482_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the global impact of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), particularly myocardial ischemia, and the limitations of current treatments, emphasizing the need for alternative therapies like traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and small-molecule drugs to address myocardial fibrosis and improve cardiac function.","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the primary cause of death worldwide (Hausenloy and Yellon). Myocardial ischaemia, the most common CVDs, is caused by the reduction in coronary blood flow due to atherosclerotic coronary arterial obstruction. Researchers find that surgical approaches restoring blood flow of coronary arteries fail to improve cardiac function of patients with myocardial ischaemia (Ngu et al.). On average, myocardial fibrosis will occur in 10% of patients. Myocardial fibrosis is the common cause of death after myocardial ischaemia, which accounts for a higher 5-year mortality (about 50%) (Benjamin et al.). Myocardial fibrosis is characterised by the collagen formation, which leads to a chamber stiffness and an increased myocardial mass (Li et al.). Tremendous efforts have been made to develop therapeutics to attenuate myocardial fibrosis and improve cardiac function in patients of myocardial ischaemia. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and small-molecule drugs are promising agents for preventing myocardial ischaemia-induced heart function impairment (Hashimoto et al.)."
TA045482_I_0002,"The introduction discusses the historical use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), focusing on Panax ginseng and its active components, ginsenosides, highlighting their cardioprotective effects and the need to explore the potential of ginsenoside Rg2 in mitigating myocardial ischemia-induced injury.","In China, TCM has been used in treating CVDs for thousands of years. A great deal of interest has focussed on elucidating the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effects of the active ingredients of TCM (Fan et al.). Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Araliaceae), a well-known TCM, is widely used for increasing vital energy and improving organ functions. Ginsenosides are the major active ingredients of ginseng. According to the structures of the extracted components of ginseng, ginsenosides are classified into three groups: the panaxadiol group including Rb1, Rb2, Rg3, and Rh2, the panaxatriol group including Re, Rh1, and Rg1, and oleanolic acid (Zhang et al.). Recent work demonstrates that ginsenoside Rb1 can reduce the injury of myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion and then improve the heart function by inhibiting the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes (Li et al.). Ginsenoside Rg1 exerts a protective effect against myocardial ischaemia-induced injury, which is associated with modulating energy metabolism and inhibiting myocardial apoptosis (Li et al.). Our previous studies indicate that ginsenoside Re treatment abrogates the myocardial fibrosis caused by myocardial ischaemia and then restores the heart function (Wang et al.). Ginsenoside Rg2 is one of the cardinal components of ginseng. Ginsenoside Rg2 has a property of attenuating the neuronal damage induced by hypoxia in hippocampal neurons (Shuangyan et al.). Ginsenoside Rg2 can also improve cerebral ischaemia-induced dementia through abating the apoptosis of neurons (Zhang et al.). However, it is still not clear whether ginsenoside Rg2 has a protective effect against myocardial ischaemic injury. Therefore, this study investigates whether ginsenoside Rg2 could alleviate myocardial ischaemia-induced myocardial fibrosis and cardiac function impairment in rats."
TA045482_M_0001,"The study utilized male Wistar rats to investigate the effects of ginsenoside Rg2 on myocardial fibrosis. The rats were divided into control and experimental groups, with some receiving isoproterenol to induce myocardial fibrosis. Ginsenoside Rg2 was administered intragastrically at two doses (5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) for 28 days. Cardiac function was evaluated using a hemodynamic analyzing system, measuring left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and the first derivative of left ventricular pressure. Histopathological examination was performed using Sirius red staining to assess myocardial fibrosis. Western blot analysis was conducted to evaluate the expression of proteins related to the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.","Male Wistar rats weighing 240–260 g were obtained from the Experiment Animal Centre of Jilin University (Changchun, China). Animals were housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle at a controlled temperature and humidity with unlimited access to food and water. The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Jilin University (Approval number, JLU2018-03-0023) and were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (publication 86-23, revised in 1986). Experiment 1: Rats were randomly divided into two groups (n = 8): a control group (1 rat was excluded because of anaesthetic overdose) and a ginsenoside Rg2 at dose of 20 mg/kg group. The rats of the control group were intragastrically administered with 0.5% CMC-Na daily for 28 days. The animals of the ginsenoside Rg2 groups were intragastrically treated with ginsenoside Rg2 daily for 28 days. Experiment 2: Rats were randomly divided into four groups (n =8): a control group, an isoproterenol group and ginsenoside Rg2 (5, 20 mg/kg) groups. To induce myocardial fibrosis, the rats were injected subcutaneously with isoproterenol (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at a dose of 5 mg/kg, once daily for 7 consecutive days (Zhang et al.). Two hours later, the animals in the ginsenoside Rg2 groups were intragastrically treated with ginsenoside Rg2 at doses of 5 or 20 mg/kg, daily for 28 days. The rats of the control and the isoproterenol groups were intragastrically administered with 0.5% CMC-Na daily for 28 days. At day 28, the body weights of the rats were recorded. The rats were anaesthetised by an intraperitoneal injection with a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). A 2 F polyethylene catheter was inserted into the left ventricle through the right common carotid artery. The catheter was connected with a hemodynamic analysing system (Model RM-6000, Nihon Kohden, Japan). Then, the left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and positive (+dp/dt) and negative (-dp/dt) maximal values of the first derivative of the left ventricular pressure were evaluated. The rats were sacrificed with overdoses of carbon dioxide after cardiac function evaluation. The hearts of the animals were collected and washed with PBS solution (4 °C). The aorta, atria, and adipose tissue were excised. Heart weights were weighed and heart weight index (mg/g) was calculated by dividing heart weight by body weight. The hearts of the rats were fixed with 10% formalin for 24 h. The specimens were embedded with paraffin and then were cut into 5 μm thick sections. According to the instruction of the manufacturer, the heart sections were stained with a Sirius red staining kit (Solarbio Life Sciences Company, China). Then, the histopathological examination was conducted by an experienced observer who was blinded to the experimental design under an Olympus microscope (IX-70, Olympus Corp., Japan). Ten fields were randomly selected from five sections in each heart. The ratio of the interstitial fibrosis area in the hearts was analysed and calculated with NIH-Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.). The myocardial fibrosis was presented by the calculation: (fibrotic tissue area)/(fibrotic tissue area + cardiomyocyte area) × 100%. Western blot was performed as previously described (Ahn et al.). The membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies: rabbit anti-TGF-β1 (1:1000, Proteintech, USA), rabbit anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (1:2000, ImmunoWay Biotechnology, USA), rabbit anti-collagen I (1:2000, Abcam, UK), rabbit anti-Smad3 (1:1500, Abcam, UK), rabbit anti-p-Smad3 (1:1500, Abcam, UK) or rabbit anti-β-actin (1:1500, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were processed with the horseradish peroxidase-labelled secondary antibody (1:2000, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China).

TA045482_R_0002,Ginsenoside Rg2 alone had no effect on cardiac function or fibrosis in normal rats but significantly improved these parameters in isoproterenol-induced myocardial ischemic rats. It reduced collagen deposition and modulated TGF-β1/Smad signaling markers.,"Result: Compared with the control group, the LVSP, the LVEDP, the +dp/dt, and the -dp/dt of ginsenoside Rg2 group did not show significant changes (Figure 1, p > 0.05). Further histopathological examination demonstrated that myocardial fibrosis in the ginsenoside Rg2 group was the same as that of the control group (Figure 2, p > 0.05). These findings indicated that ginsenoside Rg2 alone had no effect on the cardiac function and the myocardial fibrosis in normal rats. The cardiac function of the rats was evaluated with a hemodynamic analysing system. The LVEDP of the rats in the isoproterenol group was significantly increased, as compared with the control group (p < 0.01). The LVSP, the +dp/dt, and the –dp/dt in the isoproterenol group were markedly decreased (p < 0.01). Compared with the isoproterenol group, LVEDP of the rats in the ginsenoside Rg2 groups was significantly decreased, whereas the LVSP, the +dp/dt, and the –dp/dt of the ginsenoside Rg2 groups were increased (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). These results demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg2 has a property improving the cardiac function in myocardial ischaemic rats (Figure 3). The gross morphological examination showed that hearts of the rats from the isoproterenol group were significantly larger than those from the control group (Figure 4(A)). In addition, heart weight and heart weight index were significantly increased in the isoproterenol group when compared to the control group (p < 0.01). Treatment with ginsenoside Rg2 at doses of 5, 20 mg/kg abrogated partially myocardial ischaemia-induced increases of heart weight and heart weight index (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, Figure 4(B–D)). The Sirius red staining showed that there was extensive collagen deposition in the border zone of the myocardial ischaemia in the myocardial ischaemic rats, whereas treatment with ginsenoside Rg2 at doses of 5, 20 mg/kg markedly reduced contents of collagen deposition in myocardial ischaemic rats (Figure 5(A)). The red-stained area was calculated as a percentage of the total area with Image-Pro Plus software. In line with the observations mentioned above, the red-appearing collagens of the heart tissues in myocardial ischaemic animals were significantly augmented (p < 0.01). However, ginsenoside Rg2 treatment markedly decreased the contents of the collagen content in the heart tissues (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, Figure 5(B)). TGF-β1 leads to the production of collagens in myocardial fibroblasts. Smad3 is the downstream effectors of the TGF-β1 receptor. The effects of ginsenoside Rg2 on the TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway in the heart tissues were investigated in the present study. The results showed that expression of TGF-β1, p-Smad3, collagen I and α-SMA were significantly up-regulated in the heart tissues of myocardial ischaemic rats (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). However, treatment with ginsenoside Rg2 significantly decreased the expression of TGF-β1, p-Smad3, collagen I and α-SMA in the heart tissues (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, Figure 6(A–D))."

TA045482_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the role of myocardial fibrosis in cardiac repair and failure, emphasizing the detrimental effects of progressive fibrosis. It details how ginsenoside Rg2 alleviates fibrosis by modulating the TGF-β1/Smad pathway, reducing collagen deposition and improving cardiac function.","Discussion: Cardiomyocytes death during myocardial ischaemia leads to a multiphase reparative response. The damaged heart tissues are replaced by a fibrotic scar produced by myofibroblasts. The progression of ischaemic necrosis induces interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in heart ventricular wall. The interstitial fibrosis and focal replacement scars can prevent cardiac rupture which is a fatal complication of myocardial ischaemia. However, the progressive myocardial fibrosis is detrimental as it produces abnormalities in ventricular function and leads to heart failure (Prabhu and Frangogiannis). Therefore, attenuating myocardial fibrosis would offer a favourable prognosis in patients with ischaemic heart disease. The present study demonstrated for the first time ginsenoside Rg2 alone did not induce myocardial fibrosis and had no adverse effect on cardiac function. Ginsenoside Rg2 showed a property of alleviating the myocardial fibrosis and improving the impairment of cardiac function by regulating the TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway after myocardial ischaemia. Myocardial ischaemia causes the changes in the size, shape, and function of the heart and leads to cardiac failure. It is well known that the heart has no capacity of regeneration, and the lost cardiomyocytes will be replaced by a fibrotic scar (Laflamme and Murry). The fibrotic process after myocardial ischaemia is classified into replacement and reactive fibrosis, both of which are associated with myofibroblasts (Gao et al.). The characteristic of myofibroblasts is the expression of α-SMA. Therefore, the content of α-SMA is a commonly used to evaluate the myofibroblasts in heart tissues (Shinde et al.). Collagen I is the primary structural protein in the heart interstitium and is synthesised by myofibroblasts (van den Borne et al.). Myofibroblasts secrete a great deal of interstitial collagens after myocardial ischaemia, which is crucial for increasing heart weight and impairing cardiac function. The current study showed that cardiac function was impaired after myocardial ischaemia and there were significant depositions of collagen I in the heart tissues. However, treatment with ginsenoside Rg2 for 28 days improved cardiac function and decreased collagen I depositions, suggesting that ginsenoside Rg2 can ameliorate ischaemia-induced myocardial fibrosis. Numerous factors play a role in modulating the fibrosis induced by myocardial ischaemia. TGF-β1 is the cardinal pro-fibrotic growth factor involved in fibroblast activation and collagens production (Dobaczewski et al.). The previous report demonstrates that TGF-β1 leads to the transdifferentiation of myofibroblast and therefore increases the synthesis of extracellular matrix protein (Dobaczewski et al.). In hearts, TGF-β1 will be rapidly produced and released in response to ischaemia. TGF-β1 exerts its effects through binding to its receptor and induces phosphorylation of Smads. Smad3 is one of the major downstream regulators that are associated with TGF-β1-mediated myocardial fibrosis. The phosphorylation of Smad3 forms heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and then they translocate into the nucleus. In the nucleus, the complex regulates the expression of target genes related to fibrosis (e.g., collagen I) after binding to the Smad-binding element (Shi and Massagué). In this study, we found that the expression of collagen I in the myocardial ischaemic rat hearts was increased. Also, expressions of TGF-β1 and p-Smad3 were augmented, suggesting that the TGF-β1/Smad3 signalling pathway was involved in the process of myocardial fibrosis. Consistent with our hypothesis, ginsenoside Rg2 reduced expressions of TGF-β1, p-Smad3, and collagen I. These findings suggested that ginsenoside Rg2 alleviates myocardial fibrosis and therefore improves the impairment of cardiac function by regulating TGF-β1/Smad signalling pathway after myocardial ischaemia."

TA040677_I_0001,"Nitrogen is essential for plant growth and development, influencing secondary metabolite accumulation, and its modulation affects plant chemistry and volatile oil content, with studies showing varied effects on flavonoids and phenolic acids in different plants.","Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development as it represents a major component of various proteins, nucleic acids, enzymes, chlorophyll, vitamins, and hormones. The element plays a significant role in many aspects of a plant’s life, including the accumulation of secondary metabolites, growth and development, and productive yield. Its involvement in the synthesis of organic osmoregulatory substances and subsequent metabolism is crucial for enhancing plant physiology and agronomy. For instance, a previous study demonstrated how nitrogen fertilizer application can significantly increase rice yield.Increasing soil nitrogen fertilization leads to a decrease in the non-structural carbohydrate content in plants, subsequently reducing the prevalence of monoterpenes that utilize these carbohydrates as substrates for synthesis. Modulating the level of nitrogen in the soil can be an effective method for altering plant chemistry and increasing the amount of volatile oils. However, as soil nitrogen increases, so does the amount of secondary compounds that use amino acids as precursors.The distinct effects of nitrogen fertilizer on plant flavonoid content may be attributed to the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis (CNB), which states that plant growth is more constrained under nitrogen stress than during photosynthesis, necessitating an increase in secondary metabolites for antioxidant accumulation. Previous studies have demonstrated that excessive nitrogen leads to flavonoid decreases in ginkgo, apple, and buckwheat. This decrease may be attributed to the reduced activity of the phenylalanine synthetic enzyme activity, which is crucial for the production of flavonoid secondary metabolites. In the presence of excess nitrogen, this enzyme exhibits diminished activity, thereby affecting the synthesis of free flavonoids. Previous studies in medicinal plants have demonstrated that a reduction of this enzyme induced by high nitrogen levels leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of some phenolic acids like chlorogenic acid. Similarly, studies have shown that low nitrogen can increase the supply of total phenols in medicinal plants such as Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Malaysian Kacip Fatimah, and nettle, allowing for the increased formation of phenolic compounds."

This characteristic not only enhances their medicinal properties but also increases their economic value.As an essential nutrient for growth and development, nitrogen can be effectively used to increase the yield and quality of medicinal plants. The majority of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems exists as atmospheric nitrogen, or N2, a gas that cannot be directly absorbed and used by plants. Bioavailable nitrogen is scarce, leading to restrictions in plant growth and production, significantly influencing the structure and functions of ecosystems. To overcome the lack of naturally occurring nitrogen, modern growers frequently supplement their soils with fertilizers to maintain and improve crop yields. However, excessive nitrogen can reduce plant disease resistance, hindering the capacity for the accumulation of active ingredients in medicinal plants. The excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer can also increase soil caking and other potentially serious environmental consequences. Hence, it is crucial to determine the dosage of nitrogen fertilizer that will maximize the quantity and quality of A. argyi leaves without contaminating the surrounding ecosystems."

TA040677_M_0001,"The study employed pot experiments to cultivate Artemisia argyi under varying nitrogen treatments (low, control, and high nitrogen). Soil preparation included mixing yellow-brown soil with sand for ventilation. Agronomic traits such as plant height, stem diameter, and chlorophyll content were measured. Plants were harvested, dried, and processed for wormwood extraction. Nutrient content (N, P, K, Mg, Ca, Zn) was measured using colorimetric and spectrophotometric methods. Volatile oil was extracted and analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Phenolic acids and flavonoids were quantified using spectrophotometry and HPLC. Transcriptome analysis and RT-qPCR were conducted to study gene expression. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism and SPSS.","The pot experiments were conducted from January to June 2021 at the Medicinal Plant Garden of Hubei University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (30° 27′ N, 114° 15′ E). Each pot was filled with 8 kg of soil with 2 kg sand added to improve ventilation. The soil was yellow–brown and contained the following basic physical and chemical properties: pH, 5.92; organic matter, 2.6 g kg–1; total nitrogen, 0.4 g kg–1; available nitrogen, 21.4 mg kg–1; available phosphorus, 2.6 mg kg–1; and available potassium, 60.7 mg kg–1. Three herbaceous A. argyi rhizomes obtained from Qichun County in Hubei Province of China were planted in each pot in January 2021 at a depth of 3 cm. The quantities of nitrogen in each treatment were based on the Ma et al. nitrogen fertilization field trial of A. argyi in Qichun, Hubei. The treatments contained 0.5 (LN), 2 (CK), and 4 (HN) g∙10 kg−1 of nitrogen and were applied three times in total. The first application was the largest and consisted of 60% of the total fertilizer applied in January 2021. The remaining 40% was divided into two separate applications on March 23 and April 11. Additionally, we applied 1.5 g∙10 kg−1 of P2O5 and 2 g∙10 kg−1 of K2O to each treatment and added 10 mL of an Arnon trace element mixture (Ca(NO3)2 945 mg/L, K2SO4 607 mg/L, NH4H2PO4 115 mg/L, and Mg2SO4 493 mg/L) to each basin to supplement trace nutrients. After determining the emergence rate, the plants were thinned to four plants per pot and routinely managed. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. The emergence rate of A. argyi plants was investigated on March 2, 2021. Agronomic traits including plant height, stem diameter, dead leaf height, leaf number, five-leaf spacing, leaf width, leaf length, and chlorophyll content were measured on June 8, 2021. The chlorophyll content was measured with a chlorophyll meter (SPAD-502PLUS; Minolta, Tokyo, Japan). The plants were then harvested and dried in the shade. The total dry weight of A. argyi leaves and stems in each pot was measured and divided to calculate the weight per plant. A total of 10 g of dry leaves from every each pot were used for the wormwood extraction. Each sample was placed on a high-speed universal pulverizer (OAK, China) with a rotating speed of 28,000 r·min−1 for 30 s. The crushed mixture was then placed into a 2 mm sieve to remove the powder, leaving only the wormwood extract. The wormwood output rate was calculated as the ratio of wormwood to dry leaf. The leaves of A. argyi plants grown under each nitrogen treatment were harvested, dried in the shade, and crushed. The quantity of P was measured using the vanadium molybdate blue colorimetric method, and K, Mg, Ca, and Zn were measured using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. N was measured using the Kjeldahl method."
TA040677_M_0002,Volatile oil was extracted from fresh A. argyi leaves using solid-phase microextraction and analyzed via GC-MS. Phenolic acids and flavonoids were quantified using spectrophotometry and HPLC. RNA was isolated from leaves for transcriptome sequencing and RT-qPCR to study gene expression related to secondary metabolite synthesis. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism and SPSS.,"The content of volatile oil was determined according to the methods described in the general rule 2204 of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Volume IV), 2020 edition. Volatile components were identified using the following steps: weigh 0.3 g of fresh A. argyi leaves; grind the leaves; place the product into a 20 mL headspace bottle of a solid-phase microextraction instrument; insert the manual sampler of pdms-dvb extraction fiber head (Supelco, USA) into the bottle; balance at 85℃ for 10 min; push out the extraction head; empty the extract for 40 min; remove the extract and immediately insert it into the sample inlet of the chromatograph; and desorb for 3 min. The conditions of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Thermo Scientific, USA) were determined based on a previous study by Chen et al.. The Mainlib library was used to search for each chromatographic peak in the total ion flow diagram of volatile oil by GC–MS. The chromatographic peaks with a probability > 50% were selected for further analysis. The total phenolic acid and flavonoid content in fresh A. argyi leaves were determined according to Estévez et al.. Extracts from each sample were collected through the ultrasonication of 0.2 g (passed through a 40-mesh sieve) of leaf tissue combined with 50 mL of 60% methanol for 40 min. The resulting extract was then filtered and utilized for the quantification of total phenols and total flavonoids. To determine the total flavonoids, 2 mL of the sample extract was transferred into a 25 mL flask and combined with 5 mL of distilled water and 1 mL of 5% NaNO2 solution. The contents were shaken for 6 min to ensure a thorough mixture. Next, 1 mL of 10% Al(NO3)3 solution was added and sitting for an additional 6 min. The solution was then mixed with 10 mL of 4% NaOH and the final volume was adjusted to the 25 mL mark by adding distilled water. The sample was allowed to stand at room temperature for 45 min before being measured for absorbance at 509 nm using rutin as the standard. Total phenols contents were measured by adding 1 mL of the sample extract into a 25 mL brown flask with 11 mL of distilled water, followed by 1 mL of Florinol reagent. The contents were mixed for 1 min and 20% NaCO3 solution was added until the mark 25 mL mark was reached. The mixture was shaken well and allowed to stand for 50 min before being measured for absorbance at 750 nm using gallic acid as the standard. The Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) was used for all HPLC analyses. The phenolic acids and flavonoids were separated using the ZORBAXRRHD Eclipse Plus 95A C18 column (2.1 9 100 mm, 1.8 lm, Agilent) and detected at 330 nm by UV. The mobile phases were acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% phosphoric acid (B) with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The separation gradient conditions were as follows: 0–0.5 min, 2–5% A; 0.5–7 min, 5–25% A; 711 min, 25–33% A; 11–14 min, 30–33% A; 14–19.5 min, 33– 45% A; 19.5–20.5 min, 45–85% A; 20.5–27 min, 85–98% A; 27–28 min, and 98–2% A. The total RNA of leaves from each A. argyi sample was isolated using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with three biological replicates. cDNA libraries were constructed using 5 μg of RNA per sample and sequenced using the Novaseq 6000 platform. After data filtering, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome using the HISAT 2.2.4 and the Bowtie2 programs. The reference genome can be found at https://iris.angers.inra.fr/gddh13/index.html. The fragment per kilobase transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values for each transcribed area were calculated using the RESM program. A fold change > 2 and a divergence probability < 0.8 were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the DESeq2 software. The screening criteria of differentially expressed genes were |log2FC|≥ 1.00 using an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05. Enrichment analysis was performed using annotations from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO). A. argyi genes involved in photosynthesis and the synthesis of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and terpenes in leaves were selected for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) detection. The primers used for this analysis are listed in Table S1. Total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the ACTIN gene (5′-CGACTATGTTCCCTGGTATTGC-3′ and 5′-AGACCCTCCGATCCAGACACT-3′) as the internal reference. The primers were designed using the NCBI primer designing tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index.cgi?LINK_LOC=BlastHome). The RT-qPCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 Instrument II and a tiangen real universal Color Premix (SYBR green). The 2ΔΔCT method was used to calculate the relative expressions of each gene.

Transcriptome and qPCR analyses revealed LN stress upregulated flavonoid biosynthesis genes, whereas HN stress promoted terpene skeleton and photosynthesis-related genes. These findings highlight the role of nitrogen in modulating secondary metabolite production and plant growth.","Nitrogen is a key factor in various physiological and metabolic processes in plants. Providing an adequate supply of nitrogen is essential for improving the total yield and quality of the medicinal plant Artemisia argyi (A. argyi), but the underlying mechanisms of how this nutrient alters the crop remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a series of pot experiments to investigate the agronomic traits and active components in the leaves of A. argyi plants under low and high nitrogen stress. Additionally, we used transcriptome analysis and RT-qPCR to explore the molecular pathways associated with nitrogen stress. Our results demonstrate a dramatic increase in the accumulation of phenolic acids and flavonoids in the low nitrogen (LN) stress group compared to the control (CK), with increases of 40.00% and 79.49%, respectively. Interestingly, plants in the high nitrogen (HN) stress group exhibited enhanced plant growth with larger leaves, thicker stems, and a 3% increase in volatile oil content compared to the CK. Moreover, A. argyi in the HN group displayed a 66% increase in volatile oil concentration compared to the LN group. Our combined transcriptome and q-PCR results indicate that LN stress promotes the expression of genes involved in flavonoid synthesis, while HN stress promotes the expression of genes related to terpene skeleton production and photosynthesis. Taken together, these findings suggest that different gene expression levels under LN and HN stress contribute to the photosynthesis capacity and the accumulation of active ingredients in A. argyi leaves.

TA040677_R_0002,"Pot experiments revealed distinct agronomic and physiological responses in A. argyi under LN, CK, and HN treatments. HN-treated plants showed greener leaves, thicker stems, and higher chlorophyll content, while LN-treated plants exhibited nitrogen deficiency symptoms. HN stress increased volatile oil content by 60.56–64.79% compared to LN, with specific volatile components like (S)-3,3,6-Trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-yl acetate rising significantly. LN stress, however, boosted phenolic acids and flavonoids but reduced plant growth. Mineral element analysis showed HN plants had the highest N and Ca but lowest K, while CK had peak P, Mg, Cu, and Zn. Correlations between elements, agronomic traits, and metabolites were identified, with N positively linked to leaf number and chlorophyll, and K negatively correlated with these traits.","In this study, pot experiments were conducted to explore the effects of low (LN) and high (HN) nitrogen stress on agronomic traits and the accumulation of effective components in A. argyi. A. argyi plants were divided into three groups, each of which was treated with a different dosage of nitrogen fertilizer (LN 0.5 g/10 kg, CK 2 g/10 kg, HN 4 g/10 kg). Our results show that compared to the control group (CK), plants in the HN group displayed greener leaves, while plants in the LN group showed symptoms of nitrogen deficiency with yellow-green leaves and short stature (Fig. 1). We also found that both LN and HN treatment groups showed a decreased germination compared to the CK (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the CK group represented the largest plant height, dry plant height, dry stem height, and output of wormwood (Fig. 2B,I,K,H). The stem diameter, number of blades, leaf width, leaf length, and chlorophyll content were highest in the HN group (Fig. 2C,D,E,F,G), however, it showed a decrease in five-leaf spacing (Fig. 2J). Additionally, both the CK and HN groups showed significantly increased leaf weights, stem dry weights, and wormwood output rates compared to the LN group, with the highest output rate in the CK (Fig. 2J,K,L). Taken together, these results demonstrate that nitrogen fertilizer promotes the growth, development, and wormwood output rate of A. argyi leaves. Previous research has demonstrated that barley plants undergoing HN stress contain higher levels of other crucial elements (P, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Mn). Here, we analyzed the quantities of various elements in A. argyi leaves treated with differing levels of nitrogen and found that the HN group contained the highest nitrogen (1.98%) but the lowest K content (1.67%); the CK group contained the highest P content (0.157%); and the LN group contained the highest K content (2.50%). Additionally, in the LN, CK, and HN groups, the Mg content was 0.17, 0.31, and 0.19 mg/g; the Cu content was 6.45, 7.33, and 4.77 mg/kg; and the Zn content was 155.19, 170.76, and 170.24 mg/kg, respectively. The N and Ca levels were highest in the HN group, whereas the P, Mg, Cu, and Zn levels peaked in the CK group. The K content decreased most dramatically under HN stress (Fig. 3). Volatile oils, flavonoids, and phenolic acids are important secondary metabolic components in A. argyi. To explore the effects of nitrogen application on the accumulation of volatile elements, we determined the total volatile oil and volatile components in A. argyi leaves under LN, CK, and HN treatments. Compared to the LN group, we observed a 60.56% and 64.79% increase in volatile oil content in the CK and HN groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in oil content between the CK and HN groups (Fig. 4A). A more detailed analysis of the volatile substances revealed a drop in the relative percentage of eucalyptol from 12.86% to 23.12% in the CK and HN groups compared to LN. There was no significant difference in the relative percentage contents of 3, 6-Heptadien-2-ol, 2, 5, 5-trimethyl-, (E)-, (S)-2, 5-dimethyl-3-vinyl hex-4-en-2-ol and p-Mentha-1, 5-dien-8-ol between the LN and CK groups, but there was a significant increase in the HN group. Similarly, the relative percentage of (S)-3, 3, 6-Trimethylhepta-1, 5-dien-4-yl acetate increased significantly with the rise in nitrogen fertilizer application, increasing from 28.47% to 74.31%. Finally, the relative percentage of 1-octen-3-ol and caryophyllene oxide showed no significant changes to the nitrogen treatments (Fig. 4B–H). These results suggest that HN stress promotes the production of total volatile oils, with various volatile components displaying their own distinct trends. Next, we measured the quantities of flavonoids and phenolic acids in A. argyi leaves under differing levels of nitrogen stress. Our results demonstrate that the increase in nitrogen heavily impacted the abundance of flavonoids and phenolic acids in A. argyi plants, decreasing their amounts by 44.02%-74.39% and 28.57%-49.17%, respectively (Fig. 5A,B). Higher levels of nitrogen also led to an initial increase in the amount of eupatilin and hispidlin, but the elevated levels did not persist. Compared to the LN group, the content of jaceosidin rose by 6.82% and 35.58% in the CK and HN groups, respectively (Fig. 5C,D). There was no significant difference in the amount of jaceosidin between treatments (Fig. 5E). The contents of chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid C, isochlorogenic acid A, and isochlorogenic acid B were all highest in the LN treatment (Fig. 5F–K) and lowest in the CK treatment. Together, these results demonstrate that LN stress promotes the accumulation of total phenolic acids and flavonoids. During this study, we observed correlations in A. argyi leaves between seven mineral elements, agronomic traits, and the concentrations of various active ingredients (Fig. 6). In total, we identified 19 positively and 6 negatively correlated traits. We found that N content was positively correlated with leaf number, stem diameter, chlorophyll content, leaf yield, and stem dry weight; P was positively correlated with emerging number, leaf yield, and stalk dry weight; K was negatively correlated with leaf number and chlorophyll content; Cu was positively correlated with withering height; Zn was positively correlated with leaf number and stem thickness; N and K were negatively correlated; and N and Zn were positively correlated. We found significant correlations (correlation coefficients > 0.01) between the active ingredients and the leaf components in 87 trait pairs, 43 of which were positively correlated while the remaining 44 were negatively correlated (Fig. 6). In addition to volatile oil content, N was found to be negatively correlated with total phenolic acid, total flavonoids, neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, and total cryptogenic acid; P was negatively correlated with neochlorogenic acid; and K was positively correlated with all these variables plus caryophyllene oxide and eucalyptol content. Additionally, K elements showed a positive relationship with volatile oil content, total phenolic acid, total flavonoids, caryophyllene oxide, and eucalyptol. Cu was positively correlated with eucalyptol content and negatively correlated with 3,6-Heptadien-2-ol, and negatively correlated with 2,5,5-trimethyl-, (E)-, (S)-2,5-Dimethyl-3-vinylhex-4-en-2-ol content. Ca was significantly negatively correlated with eucalyptol content. We also noted both antagonistic and synergistic interactions among the seven analyzed elements. Combined, these results elucidate the interaction between the uptake and transport of mineral elements in A. argyi leaves undergoing different N treatments."
TA040677_R_0003,"Transcriptomic analysis identified 2,883 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under LN stress and 547 under HN stress compared to CK. LN stress upregulated genes in flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (e.g., CHS, CHI, PAL), while HN stress upregulated terpene skeleton biosynthesis genes (e.g., GPPS, FPPS, GGPPS) and photosynthesis-related genes. qPCR validation confirmed LN stress downregulated genes like CHS and C4H, while HN stress elevated genes like GGPPS and HMGR. Photosynthesis-related genes (e.g., AY065247-RA) were also upregulated under HN stress. These molecular insights align with the observed metabolic and physiological changes, demonstrating nitrogen's regulatory role in secondary metabolite pathways.","Next, we performed transcriptomic analyses on A. argyi leaves to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which nitrogen fertilizers affect plant growth and quality. We identified a total of 2,883 DEGs in leaves under LN stress compared to the CK group. These DEGs are comprised of 1,623 up-regulated genes and 1,260 down-regulated genes. In the HN group, we found that 265 genes were up-regulated and 282 genes were down-regulated compared to the CK group. Because different stresses have a significant impact on the amount of secondary metabolites in Artemisia argyi leaves, we focused our functional localization on the production pathways of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoids in order to further characterize the effects of nitrogen stress on the synthesis pathways of major A. argyi secondary metabolites. We carried out functional and pathway analyses using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (http://www.genome.jp/kaas-bin/kaas_main?mode=est_b;22), these identified genes were subjected to KEGG enrichment analysis (Fig. 7). We first investigated the DEGs under LN stress compared to the CK group. Of the up-regulated DEGs, 15 were enriched in ""flavonoid biosynthesis"", which involves enzymes such as chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), and flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H). An additional 30 genes were enriched in ""phenylpropane biosynthesis"", which involves enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), and p-Coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL). Of the down-regulated DEGs, 15 were enriched in ""phenylpropane biosynthesis"". Subsequently, we analyzed the identified DEGs in the HN group compared to the CK group. Two of these genes were enriched in the ""terpene skeleton biosynthesis"" pathway, which involves the enzymes such as geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS), and terpene synthases (TPS). Four genes enriched in the ""phenylpropane biosynthesis"" pathway were up-regulated, while an additional seven were down-regulated in the same category (Fig. 7). These results demonstrate the effect of nitrogen stress on the biosynthesis of flavonoids and terpenes. Flavonoids and terpenoids are the most important active ingredients in A. argyi leaves. In this study, we compared the gene expressions of these two compound classes in leaves subjected to nitrogen stress and visualized the results using a heat map (Fig. 8). In the flavonoid synthesis pathway, there was a significant decrease in the expressions of AY175438-RA and AY239769-RA, two genes that encode phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1 (PAL) synthesis, in CK and HN groups compared to the LN group. Conversely, AY177432-RA, AY239769-RA, AY067952-RA, and AY058254-RA, which encode for trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (C4H) synthesis, showed the highest expressions under LN stress. Moreover, LN also displayed high expression levels of AY183661-RA and AY1774451-RA, which encode chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), as well as other genes that regulate enzymes required for flavonoid synthesis. The HN group showed higher expression levels of genes related to the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, which is associated with terpene skeleton synthesis (Fig. 8). In this treatment, there were elevated expression levels of AY056270-RA which encodes acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT) synthesis; AY-178405-RA which encodes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR); AY-003519-RA which encodes isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPPI) synthesis; and AY-289049-RA which encodes farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (FPPS) synthesis. The MEP synthesis pathway was more mixed, with 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) encoding genes AY291248-RA, AY236918-RA, and AY001249-RA showing higher expression under LN stress, while AY-078091-RA and AY-028159-RA showed higher expression under HN stress. Finally, HN treatments were also elevated in the expression of AY-076609-RA which encodes 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2, 4-cycloid-phosphate synthase (MDS) synthesis; AY-076609-RA which encodes MDS synthesis; and AY-028715-RA which encodes geranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) synthesis. Next, we verified key genes involved in the synthesis pathways of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and terpene synthesis in A. argyi leaves by RT-qPCR. We found that an increase in nitrogen application significantly decreased the expression levels of AY148678-RA (encoding CHS), AY067952-RA (encoding C4H), and AY177451-RA (encoding CHI) (Fig. 9A,B,C). Similarly, the expression levels of AY028393-RA (encoding F3'H), AY009396-RA (encoding CHS), and AY2633333-RA (encoding CHS) were the lowest under HN (Fig. 9,E,F). The expression of AY028715-RA (encoding GGPPS), AY150191-RA (encoding isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase-IPPI), AY178405-RA (encoding HMGR), and AY078091-RA (encoding DXS) however, were elevated in the HS group (Fig. 9G,H,I,J). Additionally, we quantitatively confirmed the expression of several genes essential for photosynthesis. In the HN group, there was a distinct increase in the expression of key genes AY065247-RA and AY241096-RA, both of which are involved in the photosynthesis pathway. The expression of AY065247-RA was significantly down-regulated under LN stress and up-regulated under HN stress, while the expression of AY241096-RA showed no differences between LN and CK (Fig. 9K,L). AY070796-RA, AY163355-RA, AY175527-RA, and AY241097-RA are all involved in the chloroplast synthesis pathway, and their expression levels were significantly higher in the CK and HN groups compared to the LN group (Fig. 9M,N,O). The expression of AY241097-RA, however, was significantly up-regulated under HN stress (Fig. 9P). These results are consistent with our transcriptomic analyses."
TA040677_D_0001,"Nitrogen plays a crucial role in plant development and metabolism, but excessive use can degrade plant quality and harm the environment. This study investigates the effects of low (LN) and high nitrogen (HN) stress on Artemisia argyi (A. argyi), focusing on agronomic traits, active components, and molecular pathways. LN stress increased phenolic acids and flavonoids by 40.00% and 79.49%, respectively, while HN stress enhanced plant growth and volatile oil content. Transcriptome and qPCR analyses revealed that LN stress promotes flavonoid synthesis genes, whereas HN stress upregulates terpene skeleton and photosynthesis-related genes. These findings highlight the trade-offs between nitrogen levels, secondary metabolite accumulation, and plant growth.","Many previous studies have demonstrated the significant role N plays in sustaining plant development and metabolism. Fertilizers rich in nitrogen are often used by growers to increase crop yields, but their overuse tends to degrade plant quality and leads to secondary soil salinization and energy waste. Hence, it is crucial to determine the ideal amount of supplemental N used in growing operations to ensure a balance between plant quality and the environment. Plants can create amino acids by directly combining the salts of ammonium nitrogen with organic acids created during photosynthetic reactions, which in turn are capable of producing additional nitrogenous organic matter. A. argyi plants are small (Fig. 1) with feeble stalks (Fig. 2C) and yellow leaves (Fig. 1). Our findings reveal that the chlorophyll content (Fig. 2G) in A. argyi leaves significantly increases in higher nitrogen environments, which is consistent with previous research. A. argyi leaves are rich in volatile oils, many of which are extremely important in traditional Chinese medicine. Here, we determined the volatile oil content of A. argyi leaves undergoing various nitrogen treatments and found them to be the lowest in the LN group. There was no significant difference between the CK and HN groups, which may be explained by the effects of nitrogen on growth. Flavanoids are also incredibly important plant components, and previous research has proposed that select flavonoids have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-hypercholesterolemic, and antioxidant properties. To date, >20 flavonoids, flavanols, and their glycosides have been isolated from A. argyi leaves. In this study, we found that the total flavonoid content in A. argyi leaves decreases with high levels of applied nitrogen. We observed that eupatilin, hispidulin, and jaceosidin were most prevalent in the CK group. We also measured phenolic acid content and found them to be significantly more present in the LN group than in the CK and HN groups. Next, we assessed the synergistic and antagonistic effects of mineral element content with plant growth species and active ingredient content using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Our results showed that N content in A. argyi leaves was significantly positively correlated with photosynthesis and negatively correlated with flavonoid and phenolic acid content. This information provides a reference for future research in determining the effects of N application on metabolic pathways in A. argyi leaves. Our results support the CNB hypothesis which predicts that a higher level of carbon-based secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, are present under limited nitrogen availability. In turn, decreased nitrogen could have accelerated the metabolism of phenylpropanoids, increasing the concentration of total polyphenols in plant tissues."

We found several enriched genes associated with the synthesis of phenylalanine, flavonoids, and terpenoid skeletons. Intermediates like PAL and C4H are among the precursors for flavonoid formation. Additionally, CHS/CHI catalyzes the formation of flavanones. Our study shows that an elevated supply of nitrogen decreases the expression of AY-175438RA and AY239769-RA, genes that control the synthesis of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1 (PAL). This contrasts with AY177432-RA and AY239769-RA. Furthermore, we noted that the gene regulating trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (C4H) synthesis is most expressed under LN conditions. Our results show that under LN conditions, there are high expression levels of chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), which catalyzes the formation of flavanones, as well as other genes controlling enzymes in the flavonoid synthesis pathway like AY-067952RA and AY-058254RA. Plant terpenoids are synthesized independently via two major pathways–the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytoplasm, and the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in the plastid. HMGR is an enzyme heavily involved in the MVA pathway, which catalyzes the formation of MVA from HMG-CoA. It is considered to be the first rate-limiting enzyme regulating cytoplasmic terpenoid metabolism. The IPP is a common intermediate in both pathways and can cross the plasma membrane, creating an intersection between the two. DXS is an important rate-limiting enzyme in the DXP pathway, which catalyzes the condensation of pyruvate and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde to form DOXP, leading to the formation of carotenoids, plastoquinones, and chlorophylls. In this study, we identified several genes including AY56270-RA, AY003519-RA, and AY289049-RA, which were highly expressed in the LN treatment and are associated with the MEP synthesis pathway. Genes related to DXS enzyme synthesis like AY291248-RA, AY236918-RA, and AY001249-RA also displayed higher expression levels under LN conditions, while genes with similar functions like AY078091-RA, and AY028159-RA were more highly expressed under HN treatments. In this study, we employed transcriptomic analysis to investigate the regulation of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoid secondary metabolites in A. argyi leaves following the application of varying nitrogen dosages. We also evaluated the regulatory genes associated with the production of enzymes and compared their expression levels between nitrogen treatment groups. Further studies are needed to validate the functions of these related genes and secondary metabolites in A. argyi leaves. Additionally, our research provides guidance for methods to improve plant development, maximize production, and increase active components. We aim to provide growers with pertinent information so they may establish effective and environmentally nitrogen fertilization routines. Our findings also seed to guide sustainable agricultural practices and enhance resource efficiency, benefiting both the environment and the production of A. argyi."
TA047837_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the global burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its poor prognosis, and the limitations of current treatments, emphasizing the need for less toxic and more effective therapies, such as corosolic acid (CA) derived from Actinidia valvata Dunn and Actinidia chinensis, which shows anticancer effects by targeting YAP in the Hippo pathway.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world. It is currently the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, accounting for approximately 800,000 deaths every year. In general, the clinical treatments for HCC include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and liver transplantation. Among them, surgical resection of tumors and liver transplantation often have a curative effect in patients. However, owing to poor prognoses and high recurrence rates after resection, a large number of patients present with advanced disease and are not eligible for surgery. Although chemotherapy is an alternative choice for advanced HCC, the efficacy of chemotherapy is often hampered by a range of adverse side effects that cause patient suffering and even death. Therefore, it is urgent to focus on the development of more effective therapeutic drugs against HCC with fewer side effects. In recent years, Chinese herbal medicines have been extensively used in various anticancer studies, and a number of them have been shown to have anticancer properties. Compared to Western medicine used at a certain stage of cancer treatment, Chinese herbal medicine always shows less toxicity and is a more efficient treatment, and tumor recurrence and metastasis are less likely. Among these herbal medicines, Actinidia valvata Dunn (Actinidiaceae), a shrub that mainly grows in eastern China, has a series of applications in traditional Chinese medicine and as a folk herb. The root of this plant, commonly known as Mao renshen in China, exhibits notable anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities and has cytotoxic effects against several types of cancer cells, including liver cancer cells. Corosolic acid (CA), which is found in water extracts of Actinidia chinensis, also exhibits significant anticancer effects in HCC cells by decreasing HCC cell migration without cytotoxicity. However, the pharmacological activity of CA remains poorly understood. Cancer cell proliferation is a critical process in tumor development; thus, antiproliferation therapy is an important approach for cancer treatment. The Hippo pathway plays a critical role in controlling organ size by regulating cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP), the downstream effector of the tumor suppressor Hippo pathway, serves as an oncoprotein that significantly contributes to liver tumorigenesis. In addition, YAP acts as a central node that connects the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, p70S6K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and c-Jun/c-Fos signaling pathways and thereby forms a complex network that maintains transformative phenotypes in liver cancer cells, suggesting that molecules that inhibit YAP may be effective therapeutic targets in HCC. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between CA and YAP and to reveal the mechanism of CA in the inhibition of HCC."
TA047837_M_0001,"The study utilized various techniques to investigate the effects of corosolic acid (CA) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. HCC cell lines were cultured in specific media and treated with CA at different concentrations. The MTT assay was employed to determine cell viability and the IC50 of CA. Protein degradation was assessed using inhibitors like MG132 and cycloheximide. Transfection was performed to overexpress or knockdown specific genes, followed by Western blotting and RT-PCR to analyze protein and mRNA levels. Subcellular fractionation and immunoprecipitation were used to study protein localization and interactions. Flow cytometry measured apoptosis, while immunofluorescence visualized protein localization. In vivo experiments involved xenograft models to evaluate tumorigenesis.","The HCC cell lines Hep3B and HepG2 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). SMMC-7721, Huh7, and HLE cells were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Huh7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco, Boston, MA, USA), Hep3B and HepG2 cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium, and SMMC-7721 and HLE cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco). All the culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. In all experiments, cells were allowed to adhere prior to their exposure to CA (formula: C30H48O4; No. 4547-24-4, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 μM), with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as control. Cells were treated with 10 μM MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich) or 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX; a protein synthesis inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich) to assess the protein degradation manner. To determine the extent of apoptosis in our assays, we collected all fractions and attached and floating cells in the culture supernatant. A plasmid overexpressing mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) (vector-MDM2, No. SC118660) and its negative control vector (vector-NC), as well as the overexpressing lentivirus vector used to upregulate YAP (vector-YAP), were all purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD, USA). The short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) used to downregulate human MDM2 (sh-MDM2) and YAP (sh-YAP) expression were obtained from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). Cells were transfected with vector-MDM2 and vector-NC using INTERFERin® transfection reagent (Polyplus, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, a total of 2 × 105 cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA. The transfection efficiency was detected by Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after 48 or 24 h of transfection, respectively. Cells were extracted in lysis buffer containing 50 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin in 10 mM tris buffer (pH 7.4), and proteinase inhibitor (1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of total protein were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were incubated overnight with monoclonal antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), cleaved caspase 3/9, caspase 3/9, TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD), CREB, Runx2, YAP, p-YAP, MDM2, p53, histone, and tubulin; all were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). The membrane was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline–Tween 20 (TBST) containing 24.2 g of Tris base, 80 g of NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for a total of 1 L. Next, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (Bioworld, St. Louis Park, MN, USA) at 37°C for 1 h. The signals were visualized using a Luminata Crescendo Western horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore). Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RT-PCR was performed to amplify the cDNA using primers specific for MDM2 mRNA (forward: 5′- ACGACAAAGAAAACGCCACA -3′ and reverse: 5′-GTAACTTGATATACACCAGCATCAA-3′), CTGF mRNA (forward: 5′-GTGGAGTATGTACCGACGGC-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCAGGCACAGGTCTTGATGA-3′), ANKRD1 mRNA (forward: 5′-CCTGTGGATGTGCCTACGTT-3′ and reverse: 5′-ACAGGCGATAAGATGCTCCG-3′), and GAPDH mRNA (forward: 5′-ATCATCCCTGCCTCTACTGG-3′ and reverse: 5′-GTCAGGTCCACCACTGACAC-3′). The RNA input was normalized to the level of GAPDH. All reactions were carried out using SYBR Green Mix (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). RT-PCR was carried out using an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Invitrogen). RT-PCR data were analyzed by the 2−ΔΔCt method. Cytoplasm and nuclear fractionation were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In brief, cells were harvested and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) containing 19 g of NaCl, 0.3 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O, and 6 g of Na2HPO4·12H2O for a total of 1 L. The cells were then lysed with the help of NE-PER Nuclear & Cytoplasmic extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation samples were stored at −80°C in preparation for Western blotting detection. To carry out immunoprecipitation (IP), HepG2 cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (control) or CA for 24 h and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4), and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were then sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-YAP antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4°C. The immunocomplexes were then incubated with PureProteome magnetic beads (Millipore) for 1 h at 4°C, washed, eluted with protein sample buffer (Millipore), and analyzed by Western blotting. Cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye after staining the living cells. Briefly, cells were incubated in 100 μl of media in 96-well plates at an initial cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. After 24 h of incubation, different concentrations of CA were added to the cells, and an appropriate volume of drug vehicle was added to untreated cells. After 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of incubation, 10 μl of an MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 3 h. An SDS/isobutanol/HCl solution (100 μl) (10% SDS, 5% isobutanol, and 12 μM HCl) was added to each culture and incubated overnight. Relative cell viability was determined by scanning with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, San Diego, CA, USA) with a 570-nm filter. Cells in five wells per dose were counted in each experiment. HepG2 cells transfected with sh-MDM2, vector-YAP, or the control vectors were collected and seeded on a 6-cm dish at a density of 200 cells for each well. Cells were continually treated with 40 μM CA. Following incubation at 37°C for 14 days, the cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min and were washed with PBS three times. HepG2 cells were seeded into a 6-cm plate and given different treatments. Following 48 h of incubation at 37°C, annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) was added into the cell suspension and incubated for 5 min in the dark. Cell apoptosis was detected by using a flow cytometer (BD FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo 7.6 software. HepG2 cells at 10% confluence were seeded onto small glass coverslips and placed into 24-well plates. After 24 h of culture, CA (40 μM) was applied. The coverslips were then removed, washed with PBS three times, fixed with 100% methanol (−20°C) for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBST three times, and blocked for 1 h with 5% goat serum in PBS. Next, the cells were incubated with anti-Runx2 (1:1,000 dilution; No. #12556; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-CREB (1:500 dilution; No. #9197; Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-TEAD (1:150 dilution; No. ab221367; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) antibodies overnight at 4°C and then incubated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) AF568 (red; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or IgG AF488 (green; Life Technologies) at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. Finally, the cells were treated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:1 × 104) for 5 min, followed by being washed three times with PBST and covered with antifade mounting medium (Vectashield, Loerrach, Germany) and placed onto microscope slides. The slides were examined under a laser scanning microscope (TCS-SP2-AOBS-MP; Leica Microsystems CMS, Wetzlar, Germany). This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University). All surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Six-week-old female nude mice weighing 20–22 g were subcutaneously injected in the right armpit region with 1 × 107 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS. After xenografts were visible (10 days after injection), the mice were treated with CA (10 mg/kg) for another 28 days before the tumor sizes were measured, and equal DMSO was used as a negative control. Four groups of mice (n = 6/group) were tested. Group 1 (control) mice were injected with HepG2 cells infected with negative control (vector-NC and sh-NC) and treated with DMSO; group 2 mice (CA) were injected with HepG2 cells infected with negative control and treated with CA; group 3 mice (CA + vector-YAP) were injected with HepG2 cells infected with vector-YAP and treated with CA, and group 4 (CA + sh-MDM2) mice were injected with HepG2 cells infected with shRNA-MDM2 and treated with CA."
TA047837_M_0002,"Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the significance of the experimental results. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, and differences between groups were assessed using one-way ANOVA and Student's t-test.","All data were analyzed by SPSS 23.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The significance of the differences between the means of the treated and untreated groups was compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by unpaired Student’s t-test, and a value of p < 0.05 indicated statistical significance."
TA047837_R_0001,"The study determined the IC50 value of Corosolic Acid (CA) in various hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and investigated its mechanism of action. CA treatment at 40 μM significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis markers (cleaved caspase 3/9). It also decreased Yes-associated protein (YAP) expression by enhancing its ubiquitination and reducing stability, while increasing phosphorylation (p-YAP). CA promoted the translocation of YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, disrupting its interaction with transcription factors (CREB, TEAD, Runx2).","To determine the IC50 value of CA, we treated SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, and HLE cells with serial concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 μM) of CA. Figure 1A showed the chemical structure of CA. The IC50 of CA in SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, and HLE were 41.2, 40.2, 40.5, 40, and 41.3 μM, respectively (Fig. 1B–F). In addition, 40 μM CA treatment induced significant increases in the levels of cleaved caspase 3/caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9/caspase 9 (Fig. 1G–K). Therefore, we chose 40 μM CA for the next experiments. We next explored the underlying mechanism of CA in the progression of HCC. YAP expression was significantly reduced, while its phosphorylation level (p-YAP) was increased when HepG2, Huh7, and Hep3B cells were treated with 40 μM CA for 24 h compared to the control group (Fig. 2A–C). Next, we evaluated how CA regulated YAP expression in HCC cells. CA treatment significantly enhanced the ubiquitination of YAP protein compared to that of the control group (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we found that treatment with CA in HepG2 cells shortened the half-life of YAP compared to that measured in the control group (Fig. 2E). Together, these results suggested that stimulation with CA inhibited YAP activation. As shown in Figure 3A, CA treatment translocated YAP protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. As the pro-oncogenic role of YAP is controlled by its transcription target, such as CREB, Runx2, and TEAD, we tested whether CA controls YAP via modulating the binding of YAP to CREB, Runx2, and TEAD. Treatment with CA triggered YAP protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and reduced its binding to CREB, Runx2, and TEAD, as shown by the immunofluorescence (Fig. 3B–D) and IP results (Fig. 3E). These results indicated that stimulation with CA inhibited HCC development through inactivating YAP signaling."
TA047837_R_0002,"The study further explored the role of MDM2 in CA-induced YAP inhibition. CA increased MDM2 expression (independent of p53) and enhanced its binding to YAP, promoting YAP ubiquitination and cytoplasmic translocation. Overexpression of MDM2 weakened YAP's interaction with CREB, TEAD, and Runx2, while knockdown of MDM2 reversed CA's effects on YAP localization and ubiquitination. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed that CA's anti-tumor effects were mediated through the MDM2/YAP axis, as YAP overexpression or MDM2 knockdown abolished CA-induced tumor suppression.","A previous study reported that YAP bound to MDM2 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of 14-3-3ζ. Accordingly, we explored the effect of MDM2 on CA-induced YAP ubiquitination. Compared with the control group, CA treatment significantly increased the expression of MDM2 protein, with no obvious influence in p53 expression in HepG2, Huh7, and p53-null Hep3B cells (Fig. 4A–C). We then explored MDM2 roles in the interactions between YAP and CREB, Runx2, and TEAD proteins in HepG2 cells. The expression of MDM2 was significantly elevated when HepG2 cells were transfected with vector-MDM2, as detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting assays (Fig. 4D). The IP result demonstrated that MDM2 overexpression significantly weakened the binding of YAP protein to CREB, Runx2, and TEAD in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, compared with the control group, the expressions of CTGF and ANKRD1, downstream genes of YAP signaling, were also decreased when cells were transfected with vector-MDM2 (Fig. 4F). These data illustrated that stimulation with CA decreased YAP expression via increasing MDM2 in HCC cells. We then further revealed the role of MDM2 in stimulation with CA-induced YAP expression decrease. The expression level of MDM2, which bound to YAP protein, was increased when HepG2 cells were treated with CA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Compared with the control group, CA treatment significantly increased the contents of MDM2 and YAP in cytoplasm, while reducing their expression levels in nuclear, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5B–D) and immunofluorescence technology (Fig. 5E). In addition, we explored the role of MDM2 in CA-induced nuclear exportation of YAP protein. MDM2 expression was significantly decreased when HepG2 cells were transfected with sh-MDM2 compared with the sh-NC group (Fig. 5F). Knockdown of MDM2 increased YAP expression and decreased its ubiquitination (Fig. 5G). Moreover, downregulation of MDM2 significantly abolished CA’s role in the translocation of YAP protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. 5H and I). These results suggested that CA treatment inhibited the activation of YAP in a MDM2-dependent manner. Finally, we investigated the effect of the MDM2/YAP axis in CA-induced inhibition of HCC progression. Cell transfection with vector-YAP or sh-MDM2 significantly impaired CA-induced YAP expression repression (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the inhibitions of cell colony formation (Fig. 6B) and proliferation (Fig. 6C) induced by CA treatment were obviously neutralized when HepG2 cells were transfected with sh-vector-YAP or sh-MDM2, as well as the promotion of cell apoptosis induced by CA (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, CA administration significantly reduced in vivo tumor growth, whereas this effect was significantly impaired when cells were transfected with vector-YAP or sh-MDM2 (Fig. 6E–G). The above results illustrated that CA treatment repressed HCC progression via downregulating YAP expression and upregulating MDM2 expression."
TA047837_D_0001,"The study investigates the anticancer mechanism of corosolic acid (CA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focusing on its interaction with YAP and MDM2. CA reduces YAP stability and increases its ubiquitination, inhibiting its nuclear localization and interaction with transcription factors like CREB, TEAD, and Runx2. MDM2 plays a crucial role in this process, as CA promotes its binding with YAP, leading to YAP degradation. In vivo experiments confirm CA's antitumor effects, which are diminished when MDM2 or YAP is manipulated. The findings suggest CA as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for HCC.","The use of Chinese herbal medicine in cancer treatment, either alone or in conjunction with Western medicine, shows much promise in both the laboratory and the clinic. A previous study indicated that CA displayed anticancer activities in vitro and in vivo in the treatment of HCC cells. Specifically, CA stimulation exhibited antimigratory activity and antitumor effects in a xenograft model. Similarly, the present study also demonstrated the antitumor role of CA in HCC, which inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenesis and promoted cell apoptosis through translocating YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. These results indicate that CA could be a potential chemotherapeutic agent for HCC therapy. CA is a ursane-type triterpenoid that inhibits STAT3 in macrophages, myeloid cells, and ovarian cancer cells. CA also significantly inhibits endothelial angiogenic tube formation and tumor growth in lung, ovarian, and liver cancer cells. We also observed that CA had an anticancer effect in SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, and HLE cells. CA at concentrations between 0 and 10 μM was not cytotoxic to cells, and the IC50 of CA was about 40 μM. CA was reported to play an antitumor role largely due to its promotion of apoptosis, which inhibited cell viability in both a dose- and a time-dependent manner and triggered the activation of caspase 8, caspase 9, and caspase 3 in human cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells. Therefore, we focused on apoptosis in the present study. Our results were consistent with these findings and demonstrated that CA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, and HLE cells in a dose-dependent manner."
TA047837_D_0002,"YAP, a key transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo pathway, interacts with transcription factors like TEAD, CREB, and Runx2 to regulate cancer cell proliferation. CA disrupts these interactions by promoting YAP's cytoplasmic translocation and ubiquitination via MDM2. MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitates YAP degradation, reducing its oncogenic activity. CA's effects are p53-independent, as it does not alter p53 expression but directly regulates YAP through MDM2. The study concludes that CA's antitumor effects in HCC are mediated by YAP-MDM2 interactions, offering a novel therapeutic target.","YAP, a transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway, plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and organ development. The function of YAP is associated with a series of transcription factors including the TEAD family, and their interactions activate the transcription of genes such as Runx2 and CREB that control transformative phenotypes in cancer cells. The TEAD–YAP complex not only is frequently hyperactive in breast cancer but also exhibits strong oncogenic activity in liver cancer. YAP can also associate with Runx2 and control downstream Runx2 signaling cascades. Additionally, Wang et al. reported that the YAP–CREB interaction was critical for liver cancer cell survival and the maintenance of transformative phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Both CREB and YAP are highly expressed in a subset of human liver cancer samples and are closely correlated. CREB promotes YAP transcriptional output through binding to −608/−439, a novel region in the YAP promoter. In contrast, YAP promotes the stabilization of CREB through its interaction with mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14/p38) and beta-transducin repeat-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (BTRC). Here we observed that CA decreased YAP stability though accelerating its ubiquitination and reducing the binding of YAP with CREB, TEAD, and Runx2. CA treatment reduced the binding of YAP to TEAD, possibly because CA translocated YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It is well documented that the YAP-induced promotion of cell proliferation and survival is determined by its nuclear translocation. Our study demonstrated that CA could translocate YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which explains the inhibition of proliferation and promotion of apoptosis by CA. Moreover, the current study demonstrated that CA translocated MDM2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm before YAP. MDM2 was originally identified as a gene that was overexpressed in a spontaneously transformed mouse cell line (3T3-DM), and its gene product was found to transform normal cells. MDM2 overexpression is clinically correlated with metastasis, drug resistance, and the poor prognosis of liver cancer. However, the present study demonstrated that the upregulation of MDM2 reduced the expression of CREB, TEAD, and Runx2 and their binding with YAP as well as the decreased expression of the transcriptional regulators ankyrin repeat domain 1 (ANKRD1) and CTGF. CTGF, cyclin D1, and ANKRD1 are target genes of YAP that promote its induction of growth. ANKRD1 played an antiapoptotic role in mice cardiomyocytes by inducing the expression of Bax. As MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, we speculated that CA promoted the ubiquitination of YAP through promoting its combination with MDM2 and accelerating the degradation of YAP. As expected, the IP assay showed that the ubiquitination level of YAP protein was significantly decreased when MDM2 was downregulated in HCC cells. In addition, the downregulation of MDM2 impaired the translocation of YAP from the nucleus and increased the tumorigenesis of HepG2 cells under CA administration, suggesting that CA-induced YAP translocation from the nucleus and tumorigenesis inhibition require the presence of MDM2. Moreover, it has been reported that there are interactions between p53 and YAP. The wild-type p53 is usually associated with the suppression of YAP oncogenic activity, while mutant p53 differently interacts with YAP. MDM2 is established to inhibit tumor suppressor p53, suggesting that MDM2 might play an oncogenic role via downregulating p53 expression. In the current study, we detected the effects of CA treatment on the expression of p53, and the results showed that CA treatment had no significant influence in the expression level of p53 protein in HepG2, Huh7, and p53-null Hep3B cells. However, CA treatment can positively regulate MDM2 expression. Therefore, we conjecture that CA treatment can directly downregulate YAP expression via regulating MDM2-mediated ubiquitination in a p53-independent manner. In conclusion, the present study explored the roles and underlying mechanisms of CA in the treatment of HCC. We revealed that CA decreased cell viability and tumorigenesis and promoted cell apoptosis through translocating YAP from the nucleus in HCC in the presence of MDM2."
TA034147_I_0001,"The Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP) is a major vector of Huanglongbing (HLB), a devastating citrus disease, and the push-pull strategy involving repellent-producing transgenic plants and attractive refuge plants like Murraya paniculata is explored as a sustainable control method.","The Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), is a vector of the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), which causes the citrus disease known as huanglongbing (HLB) or greening. HLB has already decimated the citrus industry in Florida and continues to be a severe threat to citrus production worldwide. Brazil is the largest orange producer in the world and has been sustaining severe losses since 2004 when HLB was detected for the first time in the State of São Paulo. The latest assessment indicates a greening incidence rate of 44.35% (90.6 million citrus trees) in the State of São Paulo and the State of Minas Gerais West-Southwest region. Therefore, strategies to control ACP populations and/or reduce CLas transmission are sorely needed. One promising environmentally sustainable approach to mitigate ACP’s threat is push–pull, which integrates lures to attract (pull) and stimuli to repel (push) insect pests and disease vectors. For example, ornamental and other Rutaceae plants that attract ACP to a refuge area may be combined with transgenic plants that produce ACP repellents. Orange jasmine, Murraya paniculata (Rutaceae), known in Brazil as murta, has been demonstrated to attract ACP, but only 1% of psyllids may be infected by feeding on this plant species. On the other hand, the concept of plants that repel ACP was first shown with a transgenic Arabidopsis line and, subsequently, with sweet orange plants."
TA034147_I_0002,"A transgenic Arabidopsis line engineered to overexpress the sesquiterpene synthase gene At5g44630 produces α-copaene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and trace amounts of β-elemene, with behavioral measurements revealing α-copaene as a highly effective repellent at significantly lower doses than β-caryophyllene.","The first ACP-repellent transgenic Arabidopsis line was engineered to overexpress the sesquiterpene synthase gene At5g44630, which was previously demonstrated to be involved in the synthesis of β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, α-copaene, and β-elemene. Biosynthetically, these sesquiterpenes are derived from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) by distinct cyclization and derivatization pathways. For example, while β-caryophyllene is derived from the cyclization through FPP’s carbons 1 and 11, α-copaene is produced after the cyclization of FPP’s carbons 1 and 10. Thus, the Arabidopsis line engineered to produce β-caryophyllene is expected to make other sesquiterpenes, although we cannot predict their ratios. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis line yields α-copaene, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene in the nominal ratio of 1:100:10, and trace amounts of β-elemene. Behavioral measurements demonstrated that α-copaene is a potent repellent effective at 100x lower doses than β-caryophyllene. Although these two sesquiterpene repellents did not synergize, when combined, they seemed to overload the ACP’s olfactory system, thus requiring a lower dose to repel ACP. Behavioral measurements suggest that α-humulene is innocuous at the levels produced by the transgenic plant. Therefore, the tertiary mixture emitted by the transgenic plant effectively repels ACP. Lastly, we demonstrate that a commercially available copaiba oil containing β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and α-copaene in a ratio similar to that yielded by the transgenic plant is also an effective ACP repellent."
TA034147_M_0001,"The study involved rearing Diaphorina citri (Asian Citrus Psyllid) in a greenhouse under controlled conditions. The insects were maintained on orange jasmine plants (Murraya paniculata) grown in a greenhouse with no climate control. The plants were pruned to stimulate shoot growth, and adult psyllids were introduced for oviposition. After egg-laying, nymphs were allowed to develop, and newly emerged adults were used for bioassays. Behavioral responses were measured using a four-arm olfactometer in a climate-controlled room. The olfactometer was equipped with airflow systems delivering odor sources (α-copaene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, or hexane control) to test repellence. Data on insect residence time in odor fields were analyzed for normality and compared using non-parametric tests.","The adults of D. citri used in bioassays were derived from a Ca. Liberibacter spp-free colony maintained for several generations in a greenhouse at FUNDECITRUS. The insects were kept in metal cages covered with anti-aphid mesh (200 mesh). Orange jasmine plants (M. paniculata) were grown in a greenhouse with no controlled-climate conditions from seeds in 2.6 L plastic pots containing a commercially available substrate (Multiplant citrus®, Terra do Paraiso, Holambra, Sao Paulo, Brazil), which is composed of 80% Pinus sp. bark, 15% vermiculite, and 5% charcoal. They were supplied once a week with a water solution of minerals and water-irrigated twice weekly. Seedlings were pruned to a height of 30 cm to stimulate the emergence of shoots. After sprouting (0.5 to 1.0 cm in length), the seedlings were placed in cages, into which 400 mated adults were released 10–15 days after emergence. The adults were kept in cages for 7 days for oviposition on the seedlings. After that, the adults were removed, and the seedlings containing eggs were retained in the cages for nymphal development. Cages containing fourth- and fifth-instar nymphs were transported to an air-conditioned room (temperature 25 ± 2 °C, relative humidity 60% ± 10%, and photoperiod 14-h L:10-h D) for the emergence of adults and maintenance of insects under environmental conditions similar to those used in behavioral assays. Newly emerged adults were removed from cages daily and confined on M. paniculata seedlings coated with a tulle-like material for mating and age control of the insects. We used mated females between 7 and 15 days after emergence for all bioassays. All repellence responses were measured with a previously described multi-choice olfactometer operated in a climate-controlled room at 25 ± 2°C, 65 ± 10% relative humidity, and 3000 lx luminosity. In brief, we used an acrylic 4-arm olfactometer (30.0 × 30.0 × 2.5 cm; length × width × height, respectively) with a transparent acrylic lid and a yellow laserjet print paper (lightness, 84.8; chroma, 98.7; and hue angle, 95.7) under the device. Compressed air (charcoal filtered and subsequently humidified) was connected to a stainless-steel line. It split into four individual 0.635-cm-diameter polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubes (Sigma–Aldrich, Bellefonte, PA, USA) connected to four flowmeters [0.1–1 L per minute (LPM), Brooks Instruments, Hatfield, PA, USA], adjusted to an airflow of 0.1 LPM. Each PTFE tube was connected to one horizontal glass chamber (20 cm length × 6 cm internal diameter) containing an odor source (two sources of α-copaene, β- caryophyllene, and α-humulene treatment, and two sources of hexane, control; both loaded on cotton swabs), and each airflow converged through PTFE tubes to one of the four device arms. Data recorded for the time of residence of individual insects in each odor field (treatment or control) were first analyzed to determine normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test with the Prism 10.1.1 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, California, USA). Data that did not meet the assumption of normal distribution were analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Descriptive statistics are provided in the figure and figure legends. Means are presented along the standard error of the means (mean ± sem)."
TA034147_M_0002,"To test mixtures of sesquiterpenes, a slow-release device was designed to maintain the desired ratio of volatile compounds. The device consisted of a glass vial with a PTFE tubing wick filled with cotton yarn, pre-washed in hexane. The vials were loaded with hexane solutions of individual compounds or mixtures. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from odor chambers were collected using Tenax® TA tubes connected to a vacuum line. The VOCs were analyzed using thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). The compounds were thermally desorbed, cryogenically trapped, and injected into GC columns for separation and mass spectrometric detection. Authentic standards were used for calibration and identification. Copaiba oil was also analyzed to estimate the ratios of its constituents.","To test mixtures, it is critical to release semiochemicals in the desired ratio despite differences in the volatility of the mixture’s constituents. We used a slow-release ('dynamic') device inspired on the 'wick-baits' designed to release a steady flow of semiochemical mixtures faithfully representing the proportion of the components in the mixture. The 'dynamic' device was comprised of a 2 ml screw-top clear glass vial (#27329, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) capped with a blue polypropylene screw cap (#SU860092, Supelco). A 4 cm PTFE tubing (ID 1.58 mm; OD 2.1 mm, Supelco, #20531) filled with cotton yarn wick ('barbante cru 100% algodão,' São Francisco Industrial & Comercial Textil Ltd., Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil) was inserted through the vial’s cap PTFE septum and placed 1 mm from the bottom of the vial. The cotton yarn wick was prepared by washing for 5 min in hexane, three times and then dried up before inserting into the tubing. The vials were loaded with 1 ml of hexane solutions of individual compounds or mixtures. For volatile collections, each outlet of the glass odor chambers was connected to a homemade two-way glass valve with PTFE connectors. Each side of the valve was connected to a Tenax® TA tube for capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The outlets of the two Tenax tubes were connected to a second two-way glass valve, and the final outlet tube was connected to a vacuum line. These two-way valve systems allowed continuous sampling for time course analysis without disrupting the headspace or the airflow. After a specific time (e.g., 3 min), the airflow was diverted to the oppositive side to trap VOCs for the next time measurement (e.g., 3–6 min). The Tenax tube was replaced with a clean one for the subsequent collection (e.g., 6–9 min); the trapped VOCs were analyzed as described below. The specific collection for each experiment is described in the figure legends. Multiple glass odor chambers (N = 7–11) were used for replicates. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) captured in headspace samples were analyzed using thermal desorber–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) equipment. The volatile compounds were thermally desorbed from Tenax® TA (0.635 × 8.89 cm glass tubes containing 200 mg of 2.6-diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide 35–60 mesh; Sigma-Aldrich, Bellefonte, PA, USA) in the TD equipment (ULTRA-xr Thermal Desorber, Markes International Ltd., Llantrisant, UK) under a 50 mL/min helium gas flow heated to 280 °C for 5 min. The VOCs were directed to Tenax® TA-based cold traps and were cryogenically captured at a temperature of -20 °C. Subsequently, the cold traps were desorbed at 300 °C for 3 min—the transfer lines from the cold traps to the gas chromatographs were set at 200 °C. The GC column temperature was maintained at 40°C during the desorption phase. For GC-MS analyses, the following instruments were used: Shimadzu’s QP2010-plus (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and Thermo’s TRACE 1310/TSQ 9000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific (Austin, TX, USA). The Shimadzu’s GC instrument was equipped with Rxi-5ms columns (10 m, 0.10 mm, 0.10 μm film thickness or 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness; Restek, Bellefonte, PA). The Thermo’s GC (TRACE 1310) had a 10 m Rxi-5ms column. The Shimadzu’s and Thermo’s GC/MS transfer lines were kept at 250 °C. The ovens of the GCs equipped with 10 m columns were operated at the initial temperature of 40 °C and a rate of 20 °C/min until 250 °C, and then it was held at the final temperature for 2 min [40-20-250(2)]. The temperature program for GCs with 30 m columns was 40-7-250(5). Mass spectra were obtained at a collision energy of 70 eV, and all analyses were recorded in total ion chromatogram (TIC) mode, with a scanning range of m/z 40 to 450. Authentic compounds for chemical identification and quantification (calibration curves) were injected into a Calibration Solution Loading Ring (CSLR, Tenax® TA) at 0.1 ml/min for 5 min. The authentic compounds loaded on Tenax® TA tubes were desorbed, cryogenically captured, and subsequently injected into GCs following the sampling protocol described above for natural products. Copaiba oil was initially analyzed by injecting 0.5 µl hexane samples into GC-MS for chemical identification and estimation of the ratios. The oven was operated at 60-15-300(2), helium (0.4 ml/min) was used as the carrier gas, and the injector in the split mode (20:1) was set at 250 °C. The emission rates of copaiba oil and other individual repellents were measured with calibration curves obtained with authentic standards using the thermal desorber-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique."

TA040077_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the importance of carotenoids in chilli peppers for colour and nutrition, their post-harvest stability challenges, and the role of the fruit cuticle in retention, while comparing with other crops like rice and tomato.","In chilli peppers (Capsicum annuum), carotenoid pigments are responsible for the different yellow, orange, and red colouration found in ripe fruit. In addition to carotenoids conferring aesthetic and nutritional properties to the fruit, the post-harvest retention of colour is also an important fruit quality trait. The pepper crop is in demand from consumers all year round. However, due to environmental conditions in pepper-growing regions, the crop cannot be grown and harvested throughout the year. Therefore, storage of dry peppers following harvest is essential. Pepper fruits must retain quality, including colour, during post-harvest storage. Post-harvest storage losses are observed not only in fruit crops, but also in other important crops, including rice, wheat, and maize, and this affects colour and nutritional quality. Furthermore, whilst increased provitamin A capacity has been engineered in rice, resulting in a carotenoid-enriched variety known as ‘Golden rice’, maintaining such increased nutritional properties has proved challenging, as carotenoid degradation occurs upon post-harvest storage. Capsanthin and capsorubin are the two major carotenoids found in red pepper fruits, which are almost unique to the ripe fruit of peppers. Capsanthin and capsorubin are synthesized from antheraxanthin and violaxanthin, respectively, by the action of CAPSANTHIN/CAPSORUBIN SYNTHASE (CCS). Pepper carotenoids are commonly found to be esterified, making them more stable than free carotenoids. Carotenoids not only contribute to the colour properties to pepper fruits, but further have high antioxidant capacity and are therefore beneficial to human health. This antioxidant capacity is a result of their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), due to their conjugated double bond structure. Upon interaction of carotenoids with singlet oxygen (1O2), physical quenching occurs, in which energy is transferred between the two molecules. The excess energy of 1O2 is transferred to the carotenoid and yields ground state oxygen and a triplet excited carotene. Oxidation of carotenoids results in the formation of cleavage products, collectively referred to as apocarotenoids. Excessive carotenoid degradation results in colour loss. In a recent study using an identical chilli pepper panel, it was found that increased unsaturated fatty acids along with altered lipid and carotenoid-derived volatiles are associated with genotypes displaying altered colour/carotenoid retention properties. These findings have led to the hypothesis that post-harvest loss of colour/carotenoids in chilli fruit derives from lipid peroxidation and the engagement of carotenoids to scavenge and dissipate ROS, while being degraded in the process. The question arising now is: how are these ROS initiated?"
TA040077_I_0002,"The second part of the introduction discusses the role of the fruit cuticle in post-harvest quality, its composition, and its potential influence on carotenoid retention through gaseous exchange and ROS formation.","Waxy cuticles are an essential part of a plant’s physiology and play a fundamental role in the plant’s interaction with the environment. The cuticle has been further suggested to have a role in the post-harvest quality of fruit. Plant cuticles are comprised of two components: cutin monomers and waxy, or lipophilic, components, which are embedded within the cutin matrix, as reviewed in. The cuticle provides a barrier to control the entrance and exit of gases in fruits, which lack stomata. Intact pepper fruit cuticle has been shown to be permeable to a small amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen, though this permeability increases significantly upon wounding of the cuticle. Whilst gaseous exchange is essential, negative effects may be observed as a result. The role of antioxidants is evident in protecting against the harmful effects of ROS, which may be formed during the process of gaseous exchange. There is some dispute over whether this ‘cuticular’ layer, which penetrates several cell layers deep, can be termed the ‘cuticle’. For this reason, the ‘cuticular layer’ spanning several cell layers has been termed the ‘wax exocarp’, which is defined as the outermost lipophilic layer of the pericarp of an angiosperm fruit, external to the mesocarp. Pepper fruit cuticular components, and associated cuticle morphology quantitative trait loci have been previously identified. In the present study, the association of post-harvest carotenoid retention traits in chilli with altered fruit surface structure has been investigated."
TA040077_M_0001,"The study employed a diverse panel of 12 chilli pepper genotypes, including Capsicum annuum L. cv. CM334, grown under controlled glasshouse conditions. Fruits were harvested at maturity, dried, and stored to simulate industrial processes. Carotenoids were extracted using chloroform and methanol, followed by phase separation and HPLC analysis with photodiode array detection. Cuticle and wax analysis involved enzymatic digestion, solvent extraction, and GC-MS. Microscopy techniques, including light microscopy and cryo-SEM, were used to examine exocarp thickness and surface structure. Transcriptomic analysis focused on RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing to compare gene expression between high and low carotenoid retention lines.","All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, UK, unless stated otherwise. A commercial panel of 12 chilli pepper genotypes displaying diversity in colour intensity and retention phenotypes was provided by Syngenta. Capsicum annuum L. cv. CM334 (Criollo de Morelos 334) was also included in the diversity panel. Material was grown in glasshouses (25°C, 16/8 h light/dark). Pepper fruits were harvested when ripe and dried in an oven (30–40 °C) under a 12/12 h light cycle. Pepper fruits were dried for 2 weeks before being stored in hessian bags (4 °C) for a period of between 2 and 12 weeks. These conditions were selected in order to replicate the industrial drying and storage process that occurs during commercial growing and storage of chilli peppers. Carotenoids were extracted from lyophilized and homogenized chilli pepper powder. A 10 mg aliquot of tissue was used in the extraction process, employing chloroform (500 µl) and HPLC-grade methanol (250 µl). The suspension was incubated on ice, in the dark, before HPLC-grade water (250 µl) was added. A phase separation was created, and the organic layer was collected. Chloroform (500 µl) was again added to the material for extraction, a phase separation was created, and the organic layer was pooled with the initial organic phase. Separation and detection of carotenoids was performed by HPLC with photodiode array (PDA) detection, using a C30 reverse-phase column (250 × 4.6 mm), purchased from YMC, Wilmington, NC, USA. The solvent system used has been detailed previously. Carotenoids isolated from pepper fruit exocarp discs (1 cm) were extracted by washing discs in chloroform and methanol (1:1 ratio; 10 ml) in dark conditions, on a rotator. Wash solution was replaced every 24 h, and all solvent used for extraction were pooled and evaporated. Exocarp carotenoids were analysed by HPLC-PDA, as described. Discs (1 cm) of fruit pericarp tissue were dissected, and cuticle tissue was isolated using pectinase (1.5% w/v) and cellulase (0.1% w/v) in citrate buffer (0.2 mM, pH 3.7), with sodium azide (1 mM). Samples were incubated with shaking in dark conditions (35 °C; 4 d, 100 rpm). Cutin monomer extraction was performed as previously described. Analysis of extracted cutin monomers was performed using a GC-MS system (Agilent 7683 autosampler, 7890A gas chromatograph, and 5975C mass spectrometer). Fruit discs of 1 cm were dissected and dipped in chloroform (10 ml; 10 s), with the cuticle side facing downwards, into solvent to extract cuticle-bound waxes. Deuterated triacontane (C30, 10 µg) was added as an internal standard. Ten discs per biological sample were dipped. Following cuticle wax extraction, the extract was transferred to a cleaned glass vial and dried under nitrogen. Extracts were resuspended in fresh chloroform (500 µl) and transferred to a glass GC-MS vial. Extracts were dried under nitrogen, and derivatized for analysis using pyridine (30 µl) and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA; 70 µl). Samples were incubated (40 °C; 1 h) before analysis. Analysis of cuticle waxes was performed using a GC-MS system (Agilent 7820A gas chromatograph and 5977B mass spectrometer). For both cutin monomer and cuticle wax analysis, a DB-1HT capillary column (Agilent, J+W 122-1131; 30 m×250 µm×0.1 µm) was used, with a flow rate of 1.2 ml min–1. Samples were injected in splitless mode at 200 °C, with helium as the carrier gas. The oven temperature was held at 70 °C for 2 min, before ramping at 10°C min–1 to 150 °C, and then ramping at 3 °C min–1 to 310 °C. The final temperature was held for a further 20 min. MS was performed in full scan mode. Identification of chromatogram components was performed by comparing mass spectra with literature-reported spectra, in-house libraries, and the NIST 2.0 MS library. Quantification was performed by calculating peak areas relative to the internal standard."
TA040077_M_0002,"Microscopy techniques were used to analyze exocarp thickness and surface structure. Fresh fruit sections were stained with Nile Red and Fast Green for lipid and subepidermal cell visualization, respectively. Exocarp thickness was measured using ImageJ software. Cryo-SEM and SEM were employed for high-resolution imaging of fruit surfaces. Transcriptomic analysis involved RNA extraction from epidermal cells, library preparation, and Illumina sequencing to compare gene expression between high and low carotenoid retention lines. Statistical analysis included Student’s t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance, with data visualized using GraphPad Prism and Excel.","Fresh fruit were harvested, and hand sectioning was used to dissect cross-sections from the middle of the fruit. Sections were collected in distilled water. Nile Red (0.5 mg ml–1) in acetone was used to stain lipids, and Fast Green (0.5% w/v) in ethanol (90%) was used to stain subepidermal cell layers. Sections were washed in distilled water, before mounting on glass slides. A Leica DM 500 compound light microscope was used for visualization, with ×10 and ×20 objective lenses. IMS (Imagic, Imaging Ltd) software was used to capture images. Exocarp thickness was measured using ImageJ software employing light microscopy images. Exocarp was defined as the area stained pink following Nile Red staining. Three images per genotype were measured, and six measurements per image were recorded. Cross-sections of fruit were sectioned, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then sublimed (2 min) and coated with platinum. Cryo-SEM was performed using a Quorum Technologies PP3010T cryo-SEM system. Fruit samples were mounted on aluminium pin stubs (SEM sample supports), using adhesive carbon tabs. SEM was carried out using a Zeiss Evo LS15 scanning electron microscope. Sample imaging was carried out using variable pressure mode, and images were captured via a C2D detector. Three independent fruits at each of the designated developmental stages from one plant were used, with each plant representing a biological replicate. The transcriptomic analysis focused on line R8 because it showed medium carotenoid retention and high colour retention, compared with other lines such as R5 and R6 that had high carotenoid retention but medium colour retention. In addition, R8 was one of the most amenable lines to the extraction of RNA with good integrity profiles. Abrasive paper was used to isolate fruit epidermal cells, and total RNA was extracted and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen, UK) and the PureLink RNA Minikit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (ThermoFisher Scientific) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Following quality control, an mRNA library was prepared using NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep with sample purification beads, and in-house (Syngenta Ltd, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) 8 bp indexes. Libraries were sequenced using a Hi-Seq system (Illumina). Gene count was normalized using the R package EDASeq v2.16.3, and filtered. Reads were mapped to the published CM334 chilli pepper genome. The unprocessed transcriptomic data have been deposited with the NCBI under BioProject PRJNA640935. Fruits were harvested and dried as previously described. Fruits were treated with varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), either before or after fruit drying, and then stored (4 °C) for 1 month. Carotenoid content was measured using HPLC-PDA analysis. All experiments typically used 3–6 biological replicates, unless stated otherwise. This refers to one plant from which three fruit are used/harvested and analysed as an independent biological replicate. Graphs were compiled using GraphPad Prism 8 software, and means, SD, and SE were calculated using Excel (Microsoft). Significance testing, including Student’s t-tests and ANOVA, were carried out using XLstat software (Addinsoft). Student’s t-test significances were represented as: *P<0.05; **P<0.01."
TA040077_D_0001,"The study investigates carotenoid retention in Capsicum annuum (chilli pepper) during post-harvest storage, identifying genotypes with varying retention levels. Some genotypes showed up to a 50% increase in carotenoids, while others lost 25%. The fruit's surface structure, particularly a thicker lipid exocarp layer and smooth surface, was linked to better carotenoid retention. Cutin monomer content and subepidermal cutin deposits were higher in high-retention fruits, suggesting the cuticle's role in protecting carotenoids. Gene expression analysis supported this, with cutin biosynthesis and transport genes differentially expressed between high- and low-retention genotypes. Enzymatic degradation revealed that carotenoids (e.g., capsanthin) are embedded in the lipid exocarp, unlike in tomato.","In this study, a chilli pepper (Capsicum annuum) panel for post-harvest carotenoid retention was studied to elucidate underlying mechanisms associated with this commercial trait of interest. Following drying and storage, some lines within the panel had an increase in carotenoids approaching 50% compared with the initial content at the fresh fruit stage. Other lines displayed a 25% loss of carotenoids. The quantitative determination of carotenoid pigments with concurrent cellular analysis indicated that in most cases, pepper fruit with thicker (up to 4-fold) lipid exocarp layers and smooth surfaces exhibit improved carotenoid retention properties. Total cutin monomer content increased in medium/high carotenoid retention fruits and subepidermal cutin deposits were responsible for the difference in exocarp thickness. Cutin biosynthesis and cuticle precursor transport genes were differentially expressed between medium/high and low carotenoid retention genotypes, and this supports the hypothesis that the fruit cuticle can contribute to carotenoid retention. Enzymatic degradation of the cuticle and cell wall suggests that in Capsicum the carotenoids (capsanthin and its esters) are embedded in the lipidic exocarp layer. This was not the case in tomato. Collectively, the data suggest that the fruit cuticle could provide an exploitable resource for the enhancement of fruit quality."
TA040077_D_0002,"Carotenoid retention is critical for chilli pepper quality, with capsanthin being the primary red pigment. The study highlights that some genotypes (e.g., R5, R6) showed carotenoid increases during storage, possibly due to ongoing biosynthesis. The fruit cuticle's role in protecting carotenoids was emphasized, with smooth-surfaced, thick-exocarp genotypes retaining more carotenoids. Cutin, not waxes, was linked to retention, and subepidermal cutin deposits suggested deeper cuticle penetration in peppers than in tomatoes. Gene expression differences (e.g., BDG upregulation in high-retention genotypes) supported cutin's role. Carotenoids were localized in the lipid exocarp, with esterified forms (e.g., capsanthin diesters) being more stable. Oxidative experiments confirmed that a cracked cuticle allows more degradation, reinforcing the cuticle's protective role.","The retention of colour during post-harvest storage is an important quality trait for ripe chilli pepper fruit. The major carotenoid conferring red colour in chilli peppers is capsanthin, whilst other xanthophylls such as violaxanthin, neoxanthin, and antheraxanthin, along with β-carotene, are also present in fruits. Whilst carotenoid content in harvested pepper fruit has been studied previously, the change in carotenoid content during post-harvest storage, defined as carotenoid retention, has been understudied to date. Identification of genotypes which retain high levels of carotenoids is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this trait. The study presented here has demonstrated that pepper genotypes can retain carotenoids to different extents following post-harvest storage (Table 1). Interestingly, some pepper fruit genotypes showed an increase in carotenoid content during post-harvest storage, including genotypes R5 and R6, which showed carotenoid increases of 48% and 24%, respectively, following oven drying. This increase in carotenoids during post-harvest storage has previously been observed in pepper varieties, and it has been postulated that biosynthesis can proceed during post-harvest storage. In addition to carotenoid pigments, the measure of colour can encompass several other parameters. The inclusion of image analysis data in the classification of genotypes has added to the robustness and contextual interpretation of the present data. Carotenoid retention is a key quality trait not only in pepper, but also in other crop species. Carotenoid losses during post-harvest storage are well reported in a variety of crop species, and this affects both the colour quality and nutritional quality. Elevated carotenoid content has been engineered in a variety of crop plants, including rice, maize, and cassava. Whilst these studies have been successful in engineering elevated carotenoid content and, consequently, increased provitamin A capacity in these crops, significant challenges have been encountered due to the fact that these crops do not retain these carotenoids during post-harvest storage. The cuticle of fruit species has been acknowledged as a modulator of post-harvest quality, influencing the shelf-life potential of fruit crops. This study proposes the pepper fruit surface, and specifically the fruit cuticle, as a key structural feature in protecting the fruit against carotenoid losses during post-harvest storage. The carotenoid retention phenotype is associated with the fruit surface structure of pepper, which was noted because genotypes characterized as low carotenoid retention tended to show a ‘wrinkled’ or ‘cracked’ fruit surface upon fruit post-harvest drying, whilst genotypes characterized as high carotenoid retention tended to show a smooth fruit surface upon drying (Figs 1, 2). Ferulic acid has previously been demonstrated to be associated with suberin deposition in melon fruits. Suberin deposition occurs in response to wounding, to seal the compromised tissue. Interestingly, high levels of ferulic acid were observed in genotype R4, which further displayed wrinkling upon drying. Consequently, the high levels of ferulic acid, which are precursors for suberin, could be associated with cracking of the fruit surface, which involves suberin deposition. Upon further inspection of the fruit surface using light microscopy, it was noted that pepper genotypes with a smooth surface also possessed a thicker fruit exocarp. The exocarp described here consisted of a lipidic layer in which cells were embedded (Fig. 2). The fruit cuticle is normally localized only on the outer surface of epidermal cells; however, in some genotypes studied here, this lipid layer penetrates several cell layers deep within the fruit, and is consequently termed the ‘exocarp’. Microscopic analysis of the tomato cultivar M82 revealed a small amount of subepidermal cuticular material deposition; however, this did not appear to penetrate multiple cell layers deep into the fruit as presented here in the case of chilli pepper fruits. The cuticular layer has been reported to surround more than a single cell layer below the outermost epidermis in Ailsa Craig tomatoes; however, deposition of cuticular components penetrating below the epidermal cell layer has not been widely reported to the extent demonstrated in this study in pepper fruits. Genotypes possessing a smooth surface tended to have more layers of cells embedded within this lipid layer. A resistance to cuticle cracking has previously been demonstrated to correlate with a thicker fruit cuticle in the case of cherry tomato. The cuticle is composed of two components: a cutin-rich section and embedded cuticular lipophilic components. Here, increased total cutin monomer content, along with an increase in specific cutin monomers, for example 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid, were shown to be correlated with the high carotenoid retention trait in pepper fruits (Fig. 3). In contrast, cuticular wax content was not shown to be associated with the carotenoid retention phenotype (Fig. 3). This indicates that the thicker exocarp consisted of a cutin matrix, which may be supported by the finding that the tomato cd1 mutant, which presents a deficiency in cutin, displayed a significantly thinner cuticular layer with less subepidermal deposits than the M82 control. These findings suggest that the subepidermal deposits observed in the M82 tomato, and in the pepper genotypes presented here, are largely comprised of cutin. Cuticular waxes showed no association with exocarp thickness, or with the carotenoid retention trait, and this may be due to their localization to the outermost layer of the fruit surface. Further, total cuticular waxes have been shown not to correlate with water loss rate in a diverse pepper collection. This indicates that cuticle waxes may not play a critical role in traits influenced by the fruit cuticle structure, as demonstrated by their lack of correlation to water loss rate, or to the carotenoid retention trait. The cutin matrix penetrates several cell layers deep within the fruit pericarp in the form of subepidermal deposits; this suggests that subepidermal cell layers, along with epidermal cells, may synthesize cuticular components. Previous identification of attached and detached subepidermal globules in the tomato M82 cuticle raised questions regarding the mechanism responsible for depositing cuticular material in subepidermal layers. Two hypotheses were presented: (i) subepidermal cuticular material is derived from epidermal cells and trafficked into subepidermal walls; or (ii) subepidermal cells, along with epidermal cells, synthesize small amounts of cuticular components. The data presented here may support the second of these two hypotheses, in that subepidermal cells can synthesize cuticular components, as a significant trafficking network would be required to explain the depth to which cuticular components penetrate the fruit pericarp in some of the pepper genotypes described in this study. Cuticle precursor transport is not entirely understood; however, data presented here suggest that the claim that epidermal cells are responsible for cuticle synthesis and transport may need to be reconsidered. The differential expression of cuticle biosynthesis genes between the medium/high and low carotenoid retention pepper genotypes supports the finding that the fruit surface structure is associated with the carotenoid retention phenotype. Gene products identified previously as involved in pepper cuticle biosynthesis were amongst those identified as differentially expressed gene transcripts between the medium/high and low carotenoid retention genotypes. Several genes involved in the biosynthesis of A. thaliana cuticle were found to have orthologues in pepper, which were differentially expressed between the medium/high carotenoid retention genotype, with a thick exocarp (Table 2), and the low carotenoid retention genotype, which possessed a thinner fruit exocarp. An orthologue of the BDG, known in A. thaliana to be involved in cutin biosynthesis, is significantly up-regulated in the medium/high retention genotype fruits. This supports the finding that cutin monomer content is also increased, and that the exocarp is thicker, in this medium/high carotenoid retention genotype (Fig. 2). However, the Cutin Deficient 2 (CD2) gene, which in tomato has been reported to regulate cutin monomer biosynthesis, is up-regulated in the low carotenoid retention pepper genotype. Despite the fact that a cd2 tomato mutant was found to have a 98% decrease in cutin content, suggesting the crucial role of CD2 in regulating cutin biosynthesis in tomato fruit, the same influence of this gene product may not be exerted in pepper. Differential expression of genes involved in cutin monomer transport, including PEC1 and various LTP genes, may indicate that transport of these cuticular components is critical to determining the extent of subepidermal cutin deposits, and consequently exocarp thickness. Increases in these gene products could result in increased subepidermal cutin deposition. Therefore, it would seem that cuticle precursor transport is a critical step in determining cutin content. Several genes encoding components of cuticular wax biosynthesis, such as ECERIFERUM1 (CER1), ECERIFERUM3 (CER3), and the midchain alkane hydroxylase (MAH1), which are involved in alkane formation from very long chain and midchain fatty acid precursors, respectively, were also shown to be differentially expressed. In these cases, differences in gene expression did not correlate with cuticular wax content, potentially suggesting that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are operating. The data also show examples where gene transcript levels do not correlate with previously predicted functional studies; for example, MYB16 is known to be a positive regulator of cuticle development but is down-regulated in R8. These studies were performed in hot pepper accessions of a different species, Capsicum chinese, and, in the case of, low carotenoid (yellow) accessions were studied. Despite this difference, the studies were in agreement that 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid is the dominant cutin monomer and is influential in altering total cutin. In such cases, the effect of the genetic background should be considered. The creation of isogenic lines harbouring the trait could assist in future studies. Overexpression of the tomato MIXTA-like MYB transcription factor gene (SlMX1) has previously been shown to result in increased cuticle deposition in the peel, along with an increase in total fruit carotenoid content. However, the present data showed that homologues of this gene transcript were not found to be differentially expressed between the medium/high and low carotenoid retention pepper genotypes. Interestingly, carotenoids have been shown to be associated with the ripe pepper fruit exocarp. This phenomenon has not previously been observed in pepper, or in other similar fleshy fruit species, such as tomato. The observation of carotenoids within the lipidic exocarp layer following enzymatic degradation of the cell walls suggests that the lipid exocarp layer protects carotenoids from degradation. Consequently, the structure of the lipid exocarp directly influences the carotenoid retention phenotype. Further to this, the ratio of exocarp to whole-fruit capsanthin diester content is significantly greater in the high carotenoid retention genotype, R8, compared with the low genotype, R3. This suggests that the waxy, lipophilic environment of the exocarp favours the storage of more non-polar carotenoids, specifically diesters in this case (Fig. 4). Esterified carotenoids have been shown to be more stable than their non-esterified counterparts, and this may explain the increase in total carotenoid content of these cells in the high retention genotype, as esterified carotenoids are less susceptible to oxidative degradation. Whilst the mechanism by which increased esterified carotenoids are accumulated in these exocarp embedded cells is unknown, one explanation may be that these cells have an increased capacity for storage of carotenoids in subchromoplast organelles, specifically in fibrillar plastoglobuli, which are well documented regarding their role in the sequestration and storage of esterified carotenoids in pepper fruit. An increase in fibrillar structures would facilitate the accumulation of increased pigment levels within the chromoplasts of high carotenoid retention genotypes, as has previously been demonstrated. Carotenoids are localized to cells within exocarp. Spatial localization of carotenoids within outer fruit layers may influence the visual perception of the fruit, and their localization within cells embedded within a lipid layer appears to provide protection against degradation. Treatment of pepper fruits with a cracked surface structure (low carotenoid retention: R3, dried fruits) with H2O2 as an oxidative agent resulted in greater degradation of carotenoids than observed in smooth surface fruits (medium/high carotenoid retention: R8, fresh and dried fruits) (Fig. 5). This was presumably due to the cracked cuticle being more permeable to H2O2, therefore resulting in increased ROS within the fruit responsible for initiating endogenous lipid peroxidation and consequently increased carotenoid degradation. Capsorubin, capsanthin, and capsanthin diesters are well characterized as having high quenching capacity for singlet oxygen and hydroxyl free radicals, but are degraded in the process. Collectively, these data provide further evidence that the fruit surface structure is critical in protecting the fruit from permeation of ROS or their precursors. Upon permeating the cuticle barrier, ROS can initiate lipid peroxidation. Carotenoids acting as cellular antioxidants are then degraded as they dissipate reactive molecular species associated with lipid peroxidation. These findings support those postulated by, whereby altered carotenoid retention is associated with altered fatty acid content, lipid peroxidation, and the dissipation of ROS by carotenoids. The present data now demonstrate the involvement of the fruit surface structure as a means of either preventing or enabling the entry of pro-oxidants into the fruit tissue. In summary, the present study has characterized a panel of chilli pepper accessions displaying altered post-harvest carotenoid/colour retention properties. Although not exclusive, the data imply a contributory role for the fruit surface structure in post-harvest retention of pepper colour. Further studies and the construction of biparental populations and/or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to reveal robust correlations between metabolites, traits, and genetic components. These resources could in the future be used as a strategy to maintain colour/carotenoid retention in crops for improved quality and nutritional quality."

Thus far, 30 pseudopterosins (PsA-Y, iso-PsE, 2-O-Ac-PsQ, 3-O-Ac-PsQ, 2-O-Ac-PsU and 2-O-Ac-PsQ) and 11 seco-pseudopterosins (seco-PsA-K) have been isolated from specimens collected in the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Florida Keys and the Colombian islands of San Andrés and Providencia.The pseudopterosins (PsA-D, PsE, iso-PsE, PsM-O, PsX and PsY) and seco-pseudopterosins (seco-PsA-G) isolated from specimens collected in the North Caribbean Sea (the Bahamas, Bermuda and the Florida Keys) have been evaluated as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antimicrobial agents. Among them, PsN, PsA, iso-PsE and PsE were found to be the most potent compounds in mouse ear anti-inflammatory assays. Furthermore PsA and PsE, appeared to prevent eicosanoid biosynthesis by inhibition of PLA2, 5-LO and COX, degranulation of leukocytes and the consequent liberation of lysosomal enzymes. PsA-E, PsK, PsX, PsY and seco-PsA-D showed excellent and selective activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Pseudopterosins are also used in several skin care products. Methopterosin is a simple derivative of PsA and has completed Phase I and II clinical trials as a wound healing agent.Specimens of P. elisabethae collected in the southwest Caribbean Sea, specifically at the Islands of San Andres and Providencia (Colombia), have been shown to contain new pseudopterosins (PsP-V, 2-O-Ac-PsQ, 3-O-Ac-PsQ, 2-O-Ac-PsU and 2-O-Ac-PsQ, PsG and PsK), seco-pseudopterosins (seco-PsH-K), and an inter-converting mixture of non-glycosylated diterpenes (10-acetoxy-9-hydroxy- and 9-acetoxy-10-hydroxy-amphilecta-8,10,12,14-tetraenes (IMNGD)). However, only a limited number of these compounds has been evaluated for anti-inflammatory, anti-tuberculosis, anti-viral, anti-malarial and anti-cancer activity.In regards to their anti-inflammatory activity, our experiments showed that fractions enriched with pseudopterosins (PsG, PsK, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT and PsU) and seco-pseudopterosins (seco-PsJ and seco-PsK) were able to inhibit the inflammation in a 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-acetate (TPA)-induced edema assay, with results comparable to those shown by indomethacin used as the control standard. Additionally, in in vitro experiments, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU and IMNGD showed good activity for the inhibition of MPO release; PsP, PsT and IMNGD inhibit NO release and PsR inhibited thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and the superoxide anion (O2−).In other experiments, PsP was evaluated for anti-viral activity (against HSV-1, HSV-2, HVMV and VZV), and PsQ, PsR, PsU, PsV, seco-PsH and seco-PsI evaluated as anti-malaria agents (against Plasmodium falciparum) and as anti-tuberculosis agents (against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv). There is only one report discussing the cytotoxic activity of PsQ, PsR, PsU, PsV, and 3-O-acetyl-PsU against MCF-7 (breast cancer), NCI-H460 (non-small-cell lung cancer), and SF-268 (CNS) cells. These data suggest that some of these pseudopterosins have some cytotoxicity but lack potency.While there has been considerable effort towards characterizing the biological activity of pseudopterosins isolated from octocoral samples collected in the northern Caribbean, much is unknown about the bioactivity of such compounds isolated from octocoral collected from the Islands of San Andrés and Providencia. For this reason, and with a goal of expanding the potential of these compounds, here we report for the first time the antimicrobial profile against four pathogen microorganisms (S. aureus, E. faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans) and report a more complete cytotoxic profile against five human cells lines (HeLa, PC-3, HCT116, MCF-7 and BJ) for the compounds: PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU, 3-O-acetyl-PsU, seco-PsJ, seco-PsK and IMNGD (Figure 1)."
TA036902_M_0001,"The study utilized various techniques for the extraction, isolation, and purification of pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins from the octocoral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae. The methods included flash chromatography for initial separation, HPLC for final purification, and NMR for compound identification. Cytotoxic activity was assessed using the MTT assay on five human cell lines, while antimicrobial activity was evaluated via a microdilution method against four pathogenic microorganisms.","The following substances were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, USA): Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), staurosporine, vancomycin, penicillin G, gentamicin, nystatin, Luria-Bertani Broth (LB) and Sabouraud Dextrose broth (SD). Fetal bovine serum (FBS), salts for phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and organic solvents, were purchased from WRW (PA, USA). Fragments of individual colonies of P. elisabethae were collected by SCUBA (ca. 20–30 m depth) at Providencia and San Andrés islands (SW Caribbean) and identified by Dr. Monica Puyana. Voucher specimens coded as INV CNI 1612–1616, were deposited at the invertebrate collection of Museo de Historia Natural Marina Colombiana (MHNMC) at Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas de Punta Betín (INVEMAR). The dried colony fragments (30 g) from each location were extracted separately with a dichloromethane-methanol (1:1) mixture. The resulting extracts were filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation to obtain a dark green oil. The isolation of each compound was carried out according to our previously described procedures with some modifications. Each extract was subjected separately to flash C18 column chromatography and eluted with 500 mL of each solvent mixture of decreasing polarity (methanol-water 1:9, fraction F1; methanol-water 1:1, F2; methanol-water 4:1, F3; methanol 100% F4; ethanol 100% 5, F5; acetone 100%, F6; dichloromethane-methanol 5:5, F7; and dichloromethane 100%, F8). Checking by LC-MS and TLC, the fractions F4 and F5 from the Providencia extract contained a mixture of pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins and F5 from the San Andrés extract contained the interconverting mixture of non-glycosylated diterpenes (IMNGD). Fraction F4 and F5 from Providencia were mixed and subsequently separated by flash chromatography using a diol column (150 g) yielding PsG (19.1 mg), PsP (9.6 mg), PsQ (58.1 mg), PsS (2.3 mg), PsT (14.5 mg), PsU (46.6 mg), 3-O-Ac-PsU (3.5 mg), seco-PsJ (16.2 mg) and seco-PsK (1.2 mg). Final purification of all compounds was performed on HPLC, using a column Gemini C-18 (5 μm, 10 × 250 mm) and MeOH-water (9:1) as the mobile phase with a 3.0 mL/min flow rate. The isolated compounds were carefully identified by comparison of their spectral data with that shown by our previously isolated compounds. Purity was confirmed by HPLC and NMR."
TA036902_M_0002,"The cytotoxic activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated using the MTT assay on five human cell lines, including cancer and normal cells. The antimicrobial activity was assessed via a microdilution method against four pathogenic microorganisms. The results were analyzed using non-linear regression to determine IC50 values, with statistical significance evaluated using an extra sum-of-squares F test.","The cell lines HeLa (cervical cancer), PC-3 (prostate cancer), HCT116 (colorectal cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer) and normal human cell line BJ (skin fibroblasts) were used and maintained in DMEM with 5% of FBS and gentamicin 50 μg/mL. Cultures were held in 75 cm2 culture flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 100% relative humidity, changing media at least twice a week. Cells were harvested, counted, and transferred into 96 well plates and incubated for 24 h prior to the addition of the test compounds. Test sample solutions (10 μL) at the desired dilutions were added to the wells containing the cells and incubated for 48 h. Microtitration colorimetric method of MTT reduction was used to determine surviving cells at the end of the treatment period. A solution of MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was prepared in PBS and 100 μL of this solution was added to each well after the removal of 100 μL of treatment solution. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The solution in each well, containing media, unmetabolized MTT, and dead cells, was removed by suction and 100 μL of DMSO was added to each well. The DMSO was mixed by pipetting and optical density was recorded using a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader to measure the absorbance at 570 nm. Percentages of cell survival relative to vehicle control wells (wells containing only cells and DMSO) were calculated. Stock solutions (5 mg/mL) were prepared by dissolving pure compounds in DMSO and storing at 4 °C. Serial dilutions with culture media were prepared just prior to addition to test plates. The concentration of DMSO in wells was consistent across dilutions at 0.38% v/v. Staurosporine was used as the positive control and vehicle (DMSO + media) as blank. Control and test compounds (PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU, 3-O-Ac-PsU, seco-PsJ, seco-PsK and IMNGD) were assayed in duplicate for each concentration and replicated for each cell line at concentrations of 5000, 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1 nM for staurosporine and 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, and 20.0 μg/mL for compounds. Compounds isolated from P. elisabethae were tested against a panel of microorganisms including the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 375, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10741, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 14210 and the yeast Candida albicans ATCC 14035. Bacterial strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani Broth (LB) and C. albicans was cultured in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SD), for 18 h at 37 °C and 220 rpm in a humidified incubator. The antimicrobial activity was determined by a microdilution method (IC50) in 96-well microtiter plates using LB media for bacteria and SD media for the yeast seeded liquid media. In all cases, a pre-inoculated dilution was made with fresh broth. A volume of 180 μL of each microorganism suspension was inoculated in each well (105 cells/mL) and mixed with 20 μL of treatment solutions. Stock solutions were prepared by dissolving pure compounds and controls in 20% DMSO and storing at 4 °C. Penicillin G (S. aureus), vancomycin (E. faecalis), gentamicin (P. aeruginosa) and nystatin (C. albicans) were used as positive controls and vehicle (DMSO + media) as blank. The final DMSO concentration used for dissolving the extracts was less than 20%. Controls and test compounds (PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU, 3-O-Ac-PsU, seco-PsJ, seco-PsK and IMNGD) were assayed in duplicate for each of the following concentrations: 64.0, 32.0, 16.0, 4.0, 1.0, 0.25 and 0.06 μg/mL. Microplates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and optical density was recorded using a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader to measure the absorbance at 600 nm. For each experiment, correction for background absorbance was made by subtracting the value for OD600 after the compounds were added (time 0 h). Percentages of microorganism survival relative to vehicle control wells (wells containing only microorganism and DMSO) were calculated. The IC50 of the controls were also determined in parallel experiments in order to control for the sensitivity of the standard test organisms. Data were normalized and analyzed using non-linear regression to elucidate IC50 values from sigmoidal dose-response curves. Comparison between cell lines and microorganisms used extra sum-of-squares F test to evaluate IC50 between data sets. P < 0.05 was considered as indicative of significance using GraphPad Software, Prism V. 5.0."
TA036902_R_0001,"The study isolated and identified pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins from Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, evaluating their cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities. Cytotoxic assays showed moderate, non-selective activity against tumor and normal cell lines, with PsQ and PsG being the most active. Antimicrobial tests revealed selective activity against Gram-positive bacteria, with PsU, PsQ, PsS, seco-PsK, and PsG showing the strongest effects.","In this study, PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU, 3-O-acetyl-PsU, seco-PsJ, seco-PsK and IMNGD were isolated (Figure 1) by flash chromatography and HPLC and identified by spectroscopic means. The structures of all compounds were previously reported by us, and preliminary assessment of their cytotoxic (Table 1) and antimicrobial (Table 2) properties is presented here.The cytotoxic activity of the pseudopterosins (PsG, PsP, PsQ, PsS, PsT, PsU and 3-O-acetyl-PsU), seco-pseudopterosins (seco-PsJ and seco-PsK) and IMNGD against five cell lines: HeLa (cervical cancer), PC-3 (prostate cancer), HCT116 (colorectal cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer) and BJ (fibroblasts) was investigated using the MTT reduction colorimetric assay. Although no compound showed significant activity, according to the GI50 cut off value of 10 nM for pure compounds suggested by Bugelski et al., all compounds evaluated showed moderate to weak (GI50 5.8–83.9 μM) and non-selective activity against both tumor and normal cell lines as shown in Table 1.While none of these compound showed comparable activity to the reference drug staurosporine (GI50 13.6–105.6 nM) against the four tumor cell lines, PsQ and PsG were the most active compounds (GI50 values between 5.8 μM to 12.0 μM) and IMNGD showed a moderate activity with GI50 values of 9.7–19.9 μg/mL. These results are comparable with those previously reported by Rodriguez et al., who determined the GI50 values for PsQ, PsU and PsV in the NCI-H460-cell line. Results for PsQ showed a GI50 between 1.7–5.8 μM. In the same screen, PsU and PsV were generally much less toxic (GI50 20–100 μM). For the normal cell line BJ (Table 1), PsS, 3-O-acetyl-PsU, PsP, PsT and seco-PsJ did not show a considerable cytotoxic effect (GI50 > 10 μM) while PsQ, PsG, seco-PsK and PsU showed a moderate cytotoxic activity (GI50 4.5–9.3 μM). The IMNGD showed a moderate activity with GI50 of 8.3 μg/mL.The selectivity of the cytotoxic activity of the compounds, measured as the differential effect on growth of different types of cell lines, was made by comparing the effect of the compounds on inhibiting cell growth in both normal and tumor cells. The results showed no selectivity of compounds between the lines used, and all compounds induced reduction in cell survival to a similar magnitude in all lines.Preliminary conclusions regarding structure-activity relationships can be drawn from an examination of the cytotoxic activity. The position of glycosylation on the terpene skeleton appears to affect the inhibitory activity profile as, for example, PsG (glycosylated in C-9 with fucopyranose) is more active than PsP (glycosylated in C-10 with fucopyranose). Further, the type of sugar moiety also influences the activity as, for example, PsP which is glycosylated with fucopyranose is more active than PsT which is glycosylated with arabinopyranose. Likewise, PsQ (C-4’ mono-acetylated fucose as sugar moiety) is more active than PsU (C-4’ mono-acetylated arabinose as sugar moiety) and seco-PsK (non-acetylated fucose as sugar moiety) is more active than seco-PsJ (mono-acetylated arabinose as sugar moiety)."
TA036902_R_0002,"The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeast. The compounds exhibited selective activity against Gram-positive bacteria, with PsU, PsQ, PsS, seco-PsK, and PsG being the most effective. Structure-activity relationships suggest that glycosylation position and sugar type influence activity. The findings align with previous studies on related compounds, highlighting the potential of P. elisabethae as a source of bioactive compounds.","The antimicrobial activity of the pseudopterosins, seco-pseudopterosins and IMNGD was investigated against one Gram-negative bacterium (P. aeruginosa), two Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and E. faecalis) and one yeast (C. albicans), using a microdilution method. The majority of compounds evaluated showed a good IC50 (2.9–7.64 μM) and all showed a selective activity against both Gram-positive bacteria tested (Table 2), while they did not show activity against the Gram-negative bacterium or the yeast.PsU, PsQ, PsS, seco-PsK, PsG were the most active compounds (IC50 2.3–4.5 μM) against S. aureus. The IMNGD showed good activity with IC50 of 2.3 μg/mL. For E. faecalis, PsG, PsU and seco-PsK showed better activity (Table 2) compared to the reference drug vancomycin (4.2 μM) while, seco-PsJ and PsT exhibited similar activity. The IMNGD showed good activity, with an IC50 of 3.5 μg/mL. These results are comparable with the activity previously reported for PsA-E, PsK, PsX and PsY isolated from specimens collected in the north Caribbean Sea, which were reported to have minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between 4.2 and 8.8 μM.The selectivity observed in our study is comparable to that reported by Ata et al., who reported that other pseudopterosins (PsA-E, PsK, PsX and PsY) inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (S. pyogenes, S. aureus,and E. faecalis), while they were inactive against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa). This finding can be related to the fact that many Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to toxic agents in the environment, due to the barrier of lipopolysaccharides on their outer membrane.Examination of the data in Table 2 suggests the following structure–activity relationships. Firstly, PsG (glycosylated in C-9 with fucopyranose) is more active than PsP (glycosylated in C-10 with fucopyranose). Secondly, PsT glycosylated with arabinopyranose is more active than PsP, which is glycosylated with fucopyranose. Likewise, PsU (mono-acetylated arabinose as sugar moiety) is more active than PsQ and PsS (mono-acetylated fucose as sugar moiety). However, this behavior initially observed in pseudopterosins (amphilectane skeleton) is not retained when the results are compared with seco-psedopterosins (serrulatane skeleton), where, the seco-PsK (glycosylated with fucoyranose) showed more activity than seco-PsJ (glycosylated with arabinopyranose). Clearly, additional work is required to fully understand the structure–activity relationships for this family of terpenes.From the above discussion, one can note that the pseudopterosins, seco-pseudopterosins and IMNGD isolated from P. elisabethae collected at the Islands of San Andrés and Providencia (southwest Caribbean Sea) have a similar drug-like potential as the related compounds isolated from specimens collected in the north Caribbean Sea (the Bahamas, Bermuda and the Florida Keys). Further, due to their wide applicability in commercial additives, in the cosmetic industry, it might be important to consider P. elisabethae collected in Colombian waters as an alternative source of such compounds. As has been shown, the anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and cytotoxic activity of this family of compounds isolated from P. elisabethae collected at different locations at the Caribbean Sea are quite similar, regardless of a small number of differences in their structure (type of sugar moiety, position of glycosylation and stereochemistry)."

Previous studies have indicated that cancer stemness plays an essential role in chemoresistance and tumor recurrence. Gastric cancer stem cells express high levels of the surface marker CD44 and the stemness-related transcription factor OCT4. These CD44+ gastric cancer cells are invasive and resistant to chemotherapy. CD44 interaction with OCT4 signaling plays a critical role in the acquisition of cancer stem-cell properties, including chemoresistance, in cancer cells. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperon that produces an adaptive response in order to promote cell survival under stress. This protein has been identified as a human gastric-cancer biomarker and has been linked to gastric cancer stem cell-like characteristics, stemness-related protein expression, and cancer-associated fibroblast activation in the tumor microenvironment. However, the role in GRP78-mediated cancer stemness undertaken by other cells, particularly macrophages, in the tumor microenvironment remains under investigation."
TA042181_I_0002,The study examines the role of M1/M2 macrophage polarization in tumor progression and the influence of TGF-β on TAM polarization and chemoresistance.,"Generally, M1/M2 macrophage polarization regulates the progression of tumors in various cancers. M1 macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are regarded as antitumor macrophages, whereas M2-polarized macrophages expressing arginase 1 (Arg1) modulate cancer-related activities, including cancer stemness. To promote cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance, cancer cells induce macrophage M2 phenotype polarization in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) secreted by cancer cells or the tumor microenvironment promotes the differentiation of nonactivated macrophages into a tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotype while suppressing proinflammatory M1 phenotypes. This positive feedback, generated by TGF-β loops, drives the polarization of macrophages toward the protumor TAM phenotype. Additionally, the modeling of macrophage polarization influences the efficacy of cancer treatment. Therefore, inhibition of TGF-β-induced macrophage polarization is essential for TAM-induced chemoresistance related to cancer stemness."
TA042181_I_0003,The study explores the anticancer properties of betulinic acid (BA) and its potential to regulate TAM polarization and gastric cancer stemness.,"Betulinic acid (BA) is a bioactive pentacyclic triterpenoid present in white birch. Although some studies have reported that BA exhibits anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties and can be used to treat neglected tropical diseases, only a few studies have investigated the antiproliferative and migration effects of BA against gastric cancer cells. In addition, the ability of BA to regulate the tumor microenvironment by modulating TAM polarization and gastric cancer stemness remains unclear."
TA042181_I_0004,The study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms of gastric cancer stemness and the regulatory effects of BA on GRP78/TGF-β1-mediated TAM polarization and IL-6 secretion.,"Cancer stemness is a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment. Both cancer stemness targeting and combined chemotherapy may assist in inhibiting tumor growth and preventing cancer recurrence. In this study, we examined the stemness of human gastric cancer cells at molecular level and the regulation of GRP78/TGF-β1-mediated TAM polarization and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion by BA. We then investigated the inhibitory effect of IL-6 reduction on gastric-cancer cell stemness."

Total protein samples were then extracted, and protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal quantities of total proteins were separated using Bolt Bis-Tris Plus 4–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Thermo Fisher Scientific, New York, NY, USA) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After the membranes were washed with PBS and Tween 20, they were then blocked with a blocking buffer (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies GRP78 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), OCT4 (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), β-actin (1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology), TGF-β1 (1:1000; Abcam), Smad2/3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), Arg1 (1:1000; Proteintech, Martinsried, Planegg, Germany), iNOS (1:1000; Abcam), STAT3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 °C. Finally, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h and analyzed using an electrochemiluminescence detection system. Conditioned medium was obtained from AGS treated with BA or from AGS/NC, AGS/sh-GRP78, or AGS/GRP78-OE treated with SB431542. The TGF-β1 level was then determined using a TGF-β1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Abcam) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Conditioned medium was obtained from RAW 264.7 cells treated with TGF-β1 or from AGS/NC or AGS/GRP78-OE treated with SB431542. The IL-6 level was then determined using an IL-6 ELISA kit (Abcam) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate conditioned media from AGS/NC, AGS/GRP78-OE, or AGS/GRP78-OE treated with SB431542 (GRP78-OE+SB), gastric cancer cells (2 × 106) were seeded in 10 cm dishes and cultured in a medium containing 1% FBS for 2 days before being washed. A fresh nonconditioned medium was then added, and the gastric cancer cells were cultured for 24 h. Subsequently, the medium conditioned by gastric cancer cells was filtered, evaluated using ELISA, and used with RAW 264.1 cells.

TA042181_R_0001,"The study investigates the role of GRP78 in gastric cancer stemness and how betulinic acid (BA) inhibits this process by regulating the GRP78-TGF-β1 signaling pathway and macrophage polarization. BA was found to downregulate GRP78 expression in gastric cancer cells, subsequently inhibiting TGF-β1 secretion, Smad2/3 signaling, and the stemness marker OCT4. GRP78 overexpression in gastric cancer cells promoted macrophage polarization into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) via TGF-β1, which was reversed by the TGF-β inhibitor SB431542. Additionally, TAM-derived IL-6 enriched cancer stem cell populations through STAT3 signaling, further linking GRP78-TGF-β1 regulation to cancer stemness.","GRP78 is involved in the expression of TGF-β and the stemness of gastric cancer cells. However, whether BA inhibits GRP78 to regulate stemness and TGF-β remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed that BA downregulates the expression of GRP78 in human gastric-cancer AGS cells (Figure 1A,B). To determine whether BA inhibits gastric cancer-cell stemness through a GRP78-TGF-β-mediated pathway, we evaluated TGF-β1 and the expression of the stemness-related transcription factor OCT4 in AGS cells after BA treatment. The results indicated that BA inhibited TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling, TGF-β1 secretion, and OCT4 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C–E). Similar results were also observed in MKN45, another human gastric cancer cell line (Figure 1F–J). OCT4 is a key regulator that maintains the pluripotency and self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Knockdown of the cell surface stemness marker CD44 suppresses stem cell-like properties by downregulating OCT4. In addition, TGF-β1 promotes the growth of CD44+ populations in AGS, and the TGF-β inhibitor SB431542 reverses the TGF-β1-induced increase in CD44+ cells (Figure 1K,L). These findings indicate that GRP78 and TGF-β are involved in the expression of stemness-related markers in BA-treated human gastric cancer AGS cells (Supplementary Material). In colon cancer, GRP78 overexpression promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition through autocrine TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling. According to previous studies, TGF-β1 promotes the expression of the pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 and cancer stemness characteristics. In this study, to determine whether GRP78 regulates the expression of the TGF-β1-mediated stemness marker OCT4 in human gastric cancer, we evaluated the expression of TGF-β1 and OCT4 in AGS cells with GRP78 overexpression and knockdown by using Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicated that the GRP78 level in AGS cells regulated the expression of TGF-β1 and OCT4 (Figure 2A–F). In addition, TGF-β1 activated the Smad2/3 signaling pathway and regulated the transcription process through both Smad2 and Smad3. Smad2/3 downregulation also enhanced the suppression of OCT4. These findings indicate that GRP78 and BA regulate the activation of Smad2/3 (Figure 2G–J), suggesting that BA may regulate the expression of the human gastric-cancer stemness marker OCT4 through the GRP78-TGF-β1-Smad2/3 signaling pathway."
TA042181_R_0002,"The study further explores how GRP78-expressing gastric cancer cells influence macrophage polarization into TAMs via the TGF-β1 pathway, which in turn promotes cancer stemness. TGF-β1 induced M2-type macrophage markers (Arg1) while suppressing M1-type markers (iNOS). GRP78-overexpressing gastric cancer cells enhanced TAM polarization, which was reversed by the TGF-β inhibitor SB431542. TAM-derived IL-6, regulated by GRP78-TGF-β1, activated STAT3 signaling in gastric cancer cells, increasing OCT4 and CD44 expression and enriching cancer stem cell populations. These findings highlight BA's potential as a therapeutic agent targeting GRP78-mediated stemness and TAM polarization in gastric cancer.","Generally, TAMs facilitate tumor progression, and TGF-β, which is secreted by cancer cells, promotes the differentiation of macrophages into M2-like TAMs. As depicted in Figure 1A–C, BA regulated the expression of TGF-β1 in gastric cancer cells, confirming that TGF-β1 plays a role in macrophage polarization. As indicated in Figure 3A–D, TGF-β1 induced macrophages to express the M2-type marker Arg1 and downregulated the expression of the M1-type marker iNOS. In addition, IL-6 derived from TAMs increased the CSC population, and TGF-β1 regulated the expression of IL-6 in macrophages (Figure 3D). To determine whether GRP78-expressing gastric cancer cells regulate macrophage polarization through the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, macrophages were treated with either a conditioned medium containing GRP78-overexpressing gastric cancer cells or a conditioned medium containing the TGF-β1 receptor inhibitor SB431542. NC, GRP78-OE, and GRP78-OE AGS cells treated with SB431542 were then cultured for 48 h. As shown in Figure 4A, which depicts macrophage polarization assays, the cells were washed, placed in a fresh medium containing 1% FBS, and cultured for 24 h to generate a cancer cell-conditioned medium (shown in pink). RAW 264.7 cells were then incubated for 48 h in the cancer-conditioned medium. The medium was subsequently removed, and the macrophages were cultured in a fresh medium for 24 h to generate a macrophage-conditioned medium (shown in yellow). The IL-6 concentration in the macrophage-conditioned medium was then analyzed using ELISA. After 48 h of incubation in the macrophage-conditioned medium, the AGS cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. The results indicated that the conditioned medium with GRP78-overexpressing gastric cancer cells promoted the expression of the TAM/M2 marker Arg1 and suppressed the expression of the M1 marker iNOS in macrophages. In addition, SB431542, a TGF-β1 receptor inhibitor, reversed the TAM-type promotion effects, indicating that the GRP78-overexpressing gastric cancer cells promoted TAM-type macrophages through the TGF-β1 signaling pathway (Figure 4B–D). Generally, IL-6 derived from TAMs is a potent inducer that enriches CSC populations. In this study, IL-6 levels were increased in macrophages treated with a conditioned medium containing GRP78-OE and decreased in GRP78-OE containing SB431542 (Figure 4E), indicating that gastric cancer induced macrophage IL-6 elevation through the GRP78-TGF-β1 pathway. The results confirmed that GRP78-overexpressing gastric cancer cells induced macrophage IL-6 expression and that the conditioned medium containing macrophages (Figure 4A) enriched the CD44+ gastric CSC population through the TGF-β1 signaling pathway (Figure 5A,B). IL-6 is a TAM-produced cytokine that is involved in tumor progression and metastasis through the STAT3 signaling pathway and is responsible for the prosurvival adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia. In this study, macrophage-derived IL-6 was regulated by the GRP78-mediated secretion of TGF-β1 in gastric cancer cells. As shown in Figure 5C–H, IL-6 activated the STAT3 signaling pathway and induced cancer stemness by upregulating the expression of OCT4 and CD44 in gastric cancer cells."

TA042181_D_0002,"The discussion elaborates on the role of chemotherapy in treating solid cancers and the challenges posed by M2-like TAMs, which promote tumor aggressiveness and cancer stemness. It details how TAM-derived cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10 contribute to cancer stemness and chemoresistance through various signaling pathways. The discussion also explores the potential of small natural compounds, particularly BA, in targeting GRP78-mediated cancer stemness and TAM polarization. The findings suggest that BA downregulates TGF-β1 and IL-6 secretion, thereby inhibiting cancer stemness and macrophage polarization. The discussion concludes by emphasizing BA's dual role in targeting both cancer cells and macrophages to suppress cancer stemness in the tumor microenvironment.","Discussion:Chemotherapy is the primary treatment method for solid cancers. However, M2-like TAMs secrete cytokines that promote tumor aggressiveness and cancer stemness through epithelial–mesenchymal transition. TAM-derived IL-6 induces tumorigenic and invasive effects and promotes breast, colorectal, and hepatocellular cancer or gastric tumor chemoresistance through the STAT3 signaling pathway. In non-small-cell lung cancer, IL-10 derived from M2 macrophages promotes cancer stemness through the JAK1/STAT1/NF-κB/Notch1 pathway. In addition, TAM-induced IGF promotes thyroid cancer stemness and metastasis by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and TGF-β induces M2-like macrophage polarization. Therefore, the suppression of macrophage polarization into M2-like TAMs in the tumor microenvironment may inhibit TAM-derived IL-6-induced cancer stemness.Small natural compounds, including BA, are potential candidates for combined therapy. Overall, this research has demonstrated the importance of GRP78-mediated cancer stemness in gastric cancer. Generally, the stemness of gastric cancer can be identified by analyzing the expression of cell surface markers (CD44) or stemness-related transcriptional factors (OCT4). In addition, pluripotency proteins are co-expressed by CD44+ cells, and OCT4 participates in self-renewal and chemoresistance and may represent the stemness of gastric cancer. In accordance with our findings, we suggest that BA may regulate the microenvironment of gastric tumors to eliminate cancer stemness by downregulating the stemness-related transcription factor OCT4. The results revealed that GRP78 regulated the expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-β1-mediated stemness in human gastric cancer cells and that TGF-β1 derived from gastric cancer cells promoted macrophage polarization and IL-6 secretion. In addition, IL-6 stimulated gastric cancer stemness by activating the STAT3 signaling pathway and upregulating the stemness-related marker OCT4. Moreover, BA dose-dependently inhibited the GRP78-mediated secretion of TGF-β, thereby suppressing macrophage polarization, IL-6 secretion, and IL-6-mediated gastric cancer stemness (Figure 6). In a previous study, TGF-β signaling was reported to involve a positive feedback loop in the regulation of triple-negative breast cancer and macrophage-mediated cancer stemness and progression. The results also indicated that BA-induced downregulation of TGF-β through the GRP78-mediated pathway may inhibit the positive feedback loop between gastric cancer cells and macrophage-mediated cancer stemness and tumor progression.In addition to inducing GRP78/TGF-β-mediated IL-6 expression, BA may directly inhibit the secretion of IL-6 by modulating NF-κB in mononuclear cells. BA may target both cancer cells and macrophages to suppress cancer stemness in the tumor microenvironment."

TA019200_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the significance of traditional medicine, particularly in developing countries, and focuses on the Asteraceae family, specifically the Anvillea genus, with Anvillea garcinii being a key ethnomedicinal plant in Saudi Arabia. The plant is rich in bioactive compounds like flavonoids and sesquiterpene lactones, which have demonstrated various biological activities. Previous studies on A. garcinii have identified sesquiterpene lactones, including parthenolide derivatives and guaianolides, prompting further phytochemical and biological investigations to explore its therapeutic potential.","Traditional medicines are a powerful weapon for mankind and they have been used to treat several health disorders since ancient times. The last few decades have witnessed a renaissance in the use of natural products, and traditional medicine in general, to prevent or cure several ailments. While they are considered one of the possible options in several countries, they are practically the main therapeutic option in many developing countries, including those of the Arabian Peninsula. Flora of Saudi Arabia is evidently and understandably not as rich and diverse as that of countries of the Mediterranean basin; however, it has a vital role for various ecosystems, especially in maintaining the environmental balance and stability [1]. The dominating plant family is Asteraceae, one of the largest plant families on the planet, which is a family that includes more than one thousand genera and twenty thousand species [2]. Asteraceae plants are well known for their biological and pharmacological effects, largely ascribable to the presence of phytochemicals belonging to polyphenol, flavonoid, and terpenoid classes [3]. Anvillea is probably the smallest genus of the Asteraceae family, since it includes only four species, distributed in a large area spanning from North Africa to Iran, including several Middle Eastern countries, such as Egypt, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia [4]. In Saudi Arabia, Anvillea genus is represented by the following two species: A. garcinii and A. radiata. A. garcinii DC (Arabic name Nuqd) is one of the most important ethnomedicinal plants used in the Arabian Peninsula region, indicated for symptomatic relief of various illnesses such as cold, gastrointestinal disorders, and respiratory system problems [3]. Traditionally, the dried plant is crushed, mixed with honey or date and olive oil, and used to treat cold symptoms [4]. Flavonoids and sesquiterpene lactones have been the predominant class of secondary metabolites obtained by phytochemical studies on A. garcinii [5–11]. Our previous investigations on this plant disclosed the presence of sesquiterpene lactones of the guaianolide- and germacranolide-types, including the corresponding amino acid adducts, as well as some flavonoids glycosides [11–13]. The class of Anvillea sesquiterpene lactones is dominated by derivatives with the parthenolide skeleton, germacranolides endowed with significant biological activities in cancer and inflammation, as well as in metabolic disorders [14]. Previous examination of the aerial parts of A. garcinii have afforded several members of the parthenolide class, such as 9α- and 9β-hydroxyparthenolide, 9αand 9β-hydroxy-1β,10α-epoxyparthenolide, parthenolid-9-one, and its cis-isomer [15]. In addition, guaianolide-type sesquiterpenoids, a class of phytochemicals with a broad range of activities, including cytotoxic, antiprotozoal, and anti-inflammatory potential [16], also constitute prominent A. garcinii metabolites. Leucodin and zaluzanin C and their derivatives [17], as well as garcinamine E and other guaianes [13], have been isolated from this species. This richness of bioactive secondary metabolites prompted us to continue our phytochemical and biological investigation of A. garcinii, with the final aim of obtaining a detailed picture of the metabolome of this plant, providing solid scientific grounds for its use in traditional medicines and possibly, to develop a new phytotherapeutic drug from this natural source."

Selected spectra of these compounds are reported as Supplementary Materials. All these phenolic derivatives are reported from A. garcinii for the first time. The isolated metabolites (1–9) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Tables 2 and 3). Compounds 1–3 showed antifungal activities against human pathogenic fungi, with a growth inhibitory activity around 80% at 50 µg mL−1 against Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis, respectively. The respective minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 1–3 were 0.21, 0.26, and 0.38 µg mL−1 against C. albicans and 0.25, 0.31, and 0.34 against C. parapsilosis. This finding is in agreement with our previously reported results on antifungal activity of guaianolide sesquiterpenoids [26].

TA019200_R_0002,"The fumigation assay demonstrated that M. alternifolia essential oil exhibits dose- and time-dependent toxicity against S. zeamais adults, with terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol being the most effective constituents. The oil also significantly inhibited key enzymes (AChE, GST, CarE) in S. zeamais, and RNA-Seq analysis revealed differential gene expression related to metabolic and respiratory pathways.","Result: To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais. The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed. To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44,697,706 and 44,884,212 clean reads were obtained from 47,508,238 and 47,506,862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20,811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19,741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4,282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15,074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C). A total of 3,562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes). To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil. To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable."

TA042435_I_0001,"Limonene is a widely available and beneficial monoterpene with various health and industrial applications, but its volatility and instability necessitate encapsulation, traditionally using non-biodegradable synthetic polymers, which contribute to microplastic pollution.","Limonene (LM) is one of the most available hydrophobic monocyclic monoterpenes in the vegetable kingdom. As with other phytochemicals, it naturally occurs in many blends of essential oils (EOs), which provides them with an agreeable piny-lemon turpentine-like scent. Over the years, its proven harmlessness for humans and potential health promoting properties have brought LM towards increasingly high acceptance, especially for applications in cosmetics and pharma-nutraceutical formulations, as well as agri-food & beverage. Specifically, LM’s pleasant odour has long been playing a crucial role in perfume and personal care products. Similarly, LM has been extensively exploited as food & beverage aid by manufacturers to boost consumers’ satisfaction towards building their lifelong relationship. More importantly, LM provides not only a delightful sensation, but also has demonstrated broad-spectrum therapeutic benefits encompassing anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, anti-hyperalgesic, immunomodulatory, antinociceptive, anticancer, antigenotoxicity, antidiabetic, antiviral, antiallergic, antimicrobial and gastroprotective effects. Moreover, LM has demonstrated herbicidal and anthelmintic activities, hence may offer a novel, safer and greener bio-alternative to highly popular synthetic pesticides, which are typically delivered using non-degradable microplastic-based carriers. However, some limitations are associated with LM due to its extreme volatility and thermo-chemical instability. LM is prone to evaporating and may easily undergo degradation/autoxidation when exposed to hostile environment, such as heat, oxygen, and light. Therefore, LM has often been encapsulated to circumvent such shortcomings, hence achieving a longer shelf-life of products containing LM itself. To date, researchers have mainly focused on using non-biodegradable synthetic polymers to fabricate the microcapsule shells, such as highly performing melamine-formaldehyde,, but the resulting microcapsules contribute to the accumulation of persistent microplastic in the environment."
TA042435_I_0002,"Recent research highlights the potential of animal-based and plant-based natural polymers for microencapsulation, but concerns over microplastic contamination and consumer demand for sustainable alternatives drive the exploration of fungally sourced chitosan and gum Arabic as shell materials.","Recently, animal-based ingredients, such as seafood-derived chitosan and bovine/swine gelatine, have proven effective to form the microcapsule shells around emulsified LM droplets. More specifically, researchers have investigated the potential of animal sourced chitosan (a-Ch) as an encapsulating ingredient. Interestingly, a-Ch is a cationic polyelectrolyte derived from shellfish exoskeleton which has proven effective in encapsulating lipophilic ingredients, such as LM, leading to multifunctional microcapsules with a potential for personal care products. Notwithstanding, recent research has evidenced the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in blood as well as animal tissues, and seashells indeed. This type of contamination may also pose a severe risk to humans once microplastic-integrated seafood has entered the human food chain. Similarly, microcapsules with a-Ch based shell may occur with microplastics, which are then non-fully biodegradable. Accordingly, there have been increasing regulations on restricting the use of synthetic solid polymers and/or environment polluting microplastic residues in the microcapsule shells. Alongside, there is a growing demand from end-use consumers for genuinely plant-based ingredients to tackle the risk associated with animal sources (e.g., protopathic diseases), and to meet their personal and religious beliefs. As a step forward to comply with the foregoing requirements, noteworthy efforts are being undertaken by researchers to shift towards using more sustainable microplastic-free materials as the shell precursors. In our previous works, we reported the potential of fungally fermented chitosan (fCh) which had proven effective to form shells around model perfume (i.e., hexyl salicylate) and food flavour (i.e., L-Carvone) oils by complex coacervation. When compared to crustacean sourced chitosan, fCh occurs with a relatively lower chitin content, thereby resulting in a larger number of covalently decorated β-glucan branches. Therefore, fCh may benefit from enhanced conformational extensibility, as well as a more pliable structural scaffolding. Moreover, unlike a-Ch, fCh requires no aggressive acid-driven treatment to eliminate calcium carbonate and other mineral impurities."

Although Souza et al. have reported using Ch microcapsules to immobilise onto cellulose fabrics, their study only focused on the kinetic release of the active ingredient (LM).

Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, no extensive study on the mechanical and adhesive properties of vegetable chitosan based LM-entrapping microcapsules has been conducted so far. Therefore, the present research aims towards (i) developing safe microcapsules with a core of LM, fabricated via complex coacervation using gum Arabic (GA) and fCh as the shell precursors, (ii) characterising their mechanical properties using an advanced micromanipulation technique while being cognisant of the potential effect of specific fragrance oils (LM) on the microcapsule mechanical strength in comparison with the state of the art, and (iii) studying their adhesive properties using a bespoke microfluidic device fitted with a smooth polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate and operating at increasingly hydrodynamic shear stress and different environmental pHs to mimic real fabric washing and/or human sweat conditions."

Abstract: Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry has long included many appealing essential oils in products to meet consumers' needs. Among all, the demand for limonene (LM) has recently surged due to its broad-spectrum health benefits, with applications in cosmetic, detergent, and food products. However, LM is extremely volatile, hence has often been encapsulated for a longer shelf-life. To date, mostly non-biodegradable synthetic polymers have been exploited to fabricate the microcapsule shells, and the resulting microcapsules contribute to the accumulation of microplastic in the environment. So far, information on LM-entrapping microcapsules with a natural microplastic-free shell and their mechanism of formation is limited, and there is lack of an in-depth characterisation of their mechanical and adhesive properties, which are crucial for understanding their potential performance at end-use applications. The present research aims towards developing safe microcapsules with a core of LM fabricated via complex coacervation (CC) using gum Arabic (GA) and fungal sourced chitosan (fCh) as shell precursors. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) for LM was quantified by gas chromatography (GC) separation method. The morphology of microcapsules was investigated via bright-field optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and their mechanical properties were characterised using a micromanipulation technique. Moreover, the adhesive properties of the resulting microcapsules were studied via a bespoke microfluidic device fitted with a polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) substrate and operating at increasingly hydrodynamic shear stress (HSS). Spherical core-shell microcapsules (EE ~45%) with a mean size of 38 ± 2 μm and a relatively smooth surface were obtained. Their mean rupture force and nominal rupture stress were 0.9 ± 0.1 mN and 2.1 ± 0.2 MPa, respectively, which are comparable to those of other microcapsules with synthetic shells, e.g., urea- and melamine-formaldehyde. It was also found that the fCh-GA complexed shell provided promising adhesive properties onto PET films, leading to a microcapsule retention of ~85% and ~60% at low (≤50 mPa) and high shear stress (0.9 Pa), respectively. Interestingly, these values are similar to the adhesion data available in literature for microplastic-based microcapsules, such as melamine-formaldehyde (50-90%). Overall, these findings suggest that microplastics-free microcapsules with a core of oil have been successfully fabricated, and can offer a potential for more sustainable, consumer- and environmentally friendly applications in FMCGs."
TA042435_C_0002,"The discussion elaborates on the fabrication and properties of LM-laden microcapsules, highlighting their mechanical and adhesive characteristics. The microcapsules showed lower mechanical strength compared to HS-laden microcapsules, possibly due to higher interfacial energy. Adhesion tests revealed optimal retention at pH 3.2, aligning with the isoelectric point, suggesting strong electrostatic interactions. The findings support the potential of these microcapsules for eco-friendly FMCG applications.","Discussion: The fabrication of LM-laden microcapsules within a vegetable microplastic-free fCh-GA shell via pH-driven complex coacervation was investigated. Spherical as well as slightly elongated microcapsules were attained with a mean Sauter diameter of diameter of 38 ± 2 µm. The highest EE of the microcapsules was ~45%, which is similar to those in literature for similar microcapsules via CC from animal-derived Ch and other biopolymers. The mechanical properties were quantified by a micromanipulation technique. The micromanipulation results highlighted that the rupture force of the microcapsules increased with the diameter, whereas the nominal rupture stress decreased with the size on average, which is similar to other microcapsules reported in literature. However, the formed microcapsules with a core of LM were found to be mechanically weaker than those of vegetable chitosan microcapsules with a core of HS. The mean rupture tension of LM-laden microcapsules was 37.7 ± 3.0 N/m, which was significantly lower than that of HS-microcapsules (71.6 ± 3.9 N/m). Similarly, the comparison between their average nominal rupture stress suggested that LM-laden microcapsules (2.1 ± 0.2 MPa) were also lower than the HS-laden microcapsules (3.6 ± 0.3 MPa). Besides, the microcapsules exhibited an average displacement at rupture of 3.4 ± 0.4 µm, which is approximately half of that of HS-microcapsules (6.3 ± 3.1 µm). In addition, TEM analysis suggested that the shell thickness of LM-laden microcapsules increases linearly with their diameter with an average value of 0.87 ± 0.09 µm, which appeared to be statistically equal to that of HS-microcapsules (0.78 ± 0.06 µm). In other words, LM-laden microcapsules averagely ruptured at a smaller force and strain than HS-microcapsules suggesting the occurrence of less robust shells. This phenomenon may be due to the LM-fChGA interfacial energy level being relatively higher than that of HS-fChGA, possibly leading to microcapsule shells with a less energetically favourable configuration owing to the intermolecular weakening of the solid fChGA particles forming the shell. Under wet conditions, the adhesive properties of LM-laden microcapsules were investigated by a microfluidic device fitted with PET films. The highest retention performance (~60–70%) of LM microcapsules onto PET films was identified at pH 3.2 which is very similar to pHCC 3.4 and the isoelectric point (pHiep) of the microcapsules. It seemed that such pH may promote a strong mutual electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the PET film and the coacervate shells for the investigated hydrodynamic shear stress (0–0.9 Pa). Moreover, it was found that net surface charge of LM-laden microcapsules became more and more negative as the pH was increased, which contributed towards promoting the repulsive interaction between the microcapsule and the PET films already occurring with a negative charge, resulting in a reduced microcapsule retention. Overall, the results herein presented suggest that microcapsules with a core of limonene may offer an opportunity towards more environmentally and user-friendly applications in many FMCG formulations (e.g., fabric care), as well as tackling the ongoing global issues concerning animal-sourced, and microplastic-based products."
TA038373_I_0001,"The introduction outlines the two evolutionary distinct pathways for isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis, the mevalonate pathway in eukaryotes and archaea, and the methylerythritol phosphate pathway in some eubacteria and plastids, with a focus on Bacillus subtilis and its high isoprene emission.","Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene; I) or actually isopentenyl diphosphate (IDP; II) is the general precursor of all terpenoids, that represent a very diverse class of natural products. Two evolutionary distinct routes occur in nature for the biosynthesis of IDP. The spread of the two pathways is well investigated for organisms with a sequenced genome (Lange et al.; Boucher and Doolittle; Rohdich et al.). In eukaryotes and archaea IDP and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP; III) are formed via the mevalonate pathway (reviewed by Kuzuyama). This pathway is well studied and for many organisms the enzymes are characterized and the encoding genes identified. More recently, another pathway to IDP was discovered in some eubacteria and in plastids of higher plants, that proceeds via the intermediate methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) (Rohmer et al.; Rohmer).Most Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, use the MEP pathway and for E. coli this is now well documented. For Gram-positive bacteria the situation is less clear. Gram-positive cocci have been reported to only possess genes for the mevalonate pathway (Wilding et al.). In Streptomyces aeriouvifer both pathways are found (Seto et al.). In Bacillus subtilis, being regarded as the prototype for Gram-positives, only homologues of the genes for the MEP pathway are present (Wagner et al.).For E. coli the complete MEP pathway has been elucidated and the genes involved have been identified and the corresponding enzymes described (reviewed by Eisenreich et al.). The pathway exists of seven subsequent enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). The first reaction of the MEP pathway is catalyzed by a transketolase (DXS) and concerns the condensation of pyruvate (IV) and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (V) to 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (VI) (Sprenger et al.; Lois et al.). 1-deoxy-d-xylulose is a branching intermediate in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, thiamine (vitamin B1) (White; David et al.), and pyridoxol (vitamin B6), respectively (Hill et al.). The second step is catalyzed by the IspC protein, initiating a rearrangement in the carbon skeleton followed by a reduction in the keto function of (VI), and finally delivering 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (Takahashi et al.). Five other subsequently acting enzymes are needed for the synthesis of IDP, including a phosphocytidyl transferase (IspD), a kinase (IspE), a cyclophosphate synthase (IspF), and two reductases (IspG, IspH) (Fig. 1)."
TA038373_I_0002,"The introduction discusses the role of isoprene in Bacillus subtilis, its emission patterns, and the potential functions of isoprene, along with the challenges in identifying the enzymatic steps and genes involved in its biosynthesis, and the use of conditional mutants to study these genes.","Bacteria use the precursors IDP and DMADP for the synthesis of several compounds including the side chains of ubiquinone or menaquinone. Next to that, several bacterial species use these precursors to synthesize isoprene, that is emitted to their environment (Kuzma et al.). B. subtilis emits isoprene in high levels compared to other bacterial species as has been described for B. subtilis 6051, B. subtilis 23059, and B. subtilis 23856 (Kuzma et al.). Using a bioreactor system, the emission of isoprene by B. subtilis 6051 was found to occur in three phases during the growth curve (Wagner et al.). The phases correspond with respectively, glucose metabolism and secretion of acetoin, catabolism of acetoin, and the early stage of sporulation. The general laboratory strain B. subtilis 168 showed another pattern of isoprene emission, lacking phases 2 and 3 (Fall and Copley). The function of the emitted isoprene has been postulated as being a signal molecule in the natural environment of the microorganism. Another possible explanation for the emitted isoprene is the efflux as an overflow metabolite in the bacterial pathway to isoprenoid structures (Fall and Copley). The uptake of isoprene by microorganisms present in soil samples has been described as a sink of atmospheric isoprene (Cleveland and Yavitt). However, there is no full evidence supporting one of the hypotheses mentioned. Isoprene originates from DMADP. The conversion of DMADP in isoprene is known to be an enzymatic process in the poplar tree from which a gene has been isolated and characterized (Miller et al.; Schnitzler et al.). Attempts to prove the enzymatic conversion to isoprene in B. subtilis suggested the involvement of an enzymatic step. Enzymatic activity has been partially purified, but the enzyme turned out to be very labile (Sivy et al.). Until now the encoding gene could not be identified. A search for a homologue protein of the isoprene synthase from poplar tree in the genome of the B. subtilis did not yield a candidate. Based on homology with known genes, mostly from E. coli, candidate genes for the other enzymatic steps in the MEP pathway in B. subtilis have been suggested. Identification of the genes involved in this pathway should shed some light on the function of isoprene synthesis in Bacillus physiology. Due to the essentiality of the products downstream of the isoprenoid biosynthesis, like menaquinone, it is not remarkable that the candidate genes, except for the isomerase, have been shown to be essential genes for the survival of the bacterial cell (Kobayashi et al.). In the construction of the BFAN collection these knock-out strains were not viable and therefore conditional mutants have been made using a pMUTIN3-vector. The expression in these strains can be regulated by the isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible Pspac promoter (Yansura and Henner; Vagner et al.). Using this mutant system, expression levels can be regulated to a minimum for survival by decreasing the amounts of IPTG. In that way, the function of the genes can be investigated. Identification of the involvement of certain genes in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, may create possibilities to redirect the metabolic flux toward IDP. The possibilities of pathway engineering have shown their strength already in other microorganisms, like E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The metabolic flux was dependent mainly on the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), the isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (Idi), and the prenyltransferase delivering farnesyl diphosphate (IspA) (Harker and Bramley; Kim and Keasling; Kajiwara et al.; Martin et al.). By up-regulation of the MEP pathway, B. subtilis can be developed as an interesting host organism for the production of complex terpenoid compounds, such as the valuable drugs artemisinin and paclitaxel. In the present study we describe the functional analysis of genes in B. subtilis putatively encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the terpenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate. We used quantitative isoprene emission of different well controllable knock-out Bacillus strains in their environment to determine the function of the tested genes."
TA038373_M_0001,"The study utilized Bacillus subtilis strains obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, including wild-type and mutant strains generated through chromosomal integration of pMUTIN3-derived plasmids. Bacterial cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium, supplemented with erythromycin and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as needed. Cells were washed and resuspended to remove residual IPTG before inoculation into fresh medium. Isoprene emission was measured using an online gas chromatography system with a Tenax GA trap and photoionization detection, while bacterial growth was monitored by optical density at 600 nm.","Bacterial strains used are listed in Table 1. B. subtilis strains 6051, 23059 and 23856 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, USA). B. subtilis mutant strains were obtained through a chromosomal integration of pMUTIN3 derived plasmids (Vagner et al.). Experiments were performed using Luria-Bertani (LB)-medium containing 1% bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl (all purchased from Duchefa, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands). If required, medium was supplemented with erythromycin (2 μg/ml; Duchefa, the Netherlands) or the specified concentration of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Duchefa, the Netherlands). For growing on plates the medium was solidified with 1.5% agar. A single colony of the different B. subtilis strains was transferred from a plate to 10 ml Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (if required supplemented with 2 μg/ml erythromycin and 100 μM IPTG) and grown over night (37°C; 300 rpm). Before the inoculation (1:100) of fresh LB medium containing different specified concentrations of IPTG, cells were gently washed three times with fresh LB-medium without IPTG by resuspending and centrifugating. Isoprene accumulation was measured on-line by sampling every 15 min, during a period of nine hours, 15 ml of the air above 50 ml bacterial culture, growing (37°C; 300 rpm) in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer air tight flask (CBN, the Netherlands), and transferring into a gas-chromatography system suitable for the sensitive detection of isoprene (Syntech Spectras GC955 series 601, Synspec BV, the Netherlands) (Loreto and Delfine). The air was pumped through a Tenax GA trap, desorbed at 180°C and transferred to an AT 5 column under a flow of 2.5 ml/min nitrogen (3.7 bars; quality 5). The temperature program used was 3 min at 50°C followed by an increase in temperature to 70°C at 5 min; kept at this temperature until 12 min and than lowered to 50°C again. The isoprene present was detected by photo ionization at 10.6 eV. The gas chromatograph was calibrated using the dynamic gas dilution principle with several concentrations of gaseous isoprene using liquid isoprene (Sigma, USA) diluted in methanol and evaporated with a gas dilutor (MK5, MCZ Umwelttechnik, Germany). During the isoprene detection the growth of the bacterial culture was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD600 nm) every hour."
TA038373_R_0001,"The study investigates isoprene emission in Bacillus subtilis wild type strains and identifies genes involved in the MEP pathway. Four strains (168, 6051, 23059, 23856) showed isoprene accumulation during logarithmic growth, with varying maximum levels (400–700 μg/m³). When corrected for cell density (OD600), strain 168 produced 148 μg/m³/OD600, while 6051, 23059, and 23856 produced 166, 192, and 112 μg/m³/OD600, respectively. Conditional knock-out strains were tested under IPTG depletion to assess gene function. Most mutants showed growth inhibition at low IPTG, except for 168IyqfY (IspG homologue), which grew normally without IPTG. The 168IyqiE mutant (dxs gene, step 1) exhibited a 15-fold decrease in isoprene emission under limited IPTG (10 μM) compared to full induction (1 mM). Other mutants (yluB, yacM, yabH, yacN, yqfP) showed 5–28-fold decreases in isoprene emission. The ypgA (step 8) and yqiD (step 9) mutants did not significantly affect isoprene production.","The emission of isoprene from B. subtilis wild type strains 168, 6051, 23059, and 23856 was investigated. For all four strains isoprene accumulated in the logarithmic phase of growth, leading to a high increase in isoprene in the flask. The absolute maximum of wild type strains varied between 400 and 700 μg/m3. Starting from the late logarithmic phase to the beginning of the stationary phase the amount of isoprene in the flask decreased slowly. Figure 2 shows the accumulation of isoprene during the growth of the wild type strains 168 and 6051. B. subtilis 6051 reached higher levels of isoprene, but this is probably not caused by a higher production rate rather than the amount of cells present, as reflected by the optical density of these strains. Corrected for the amount of cells, determined as the optical density at 600 nm, B. subtilis 168 accumulated at maximum 148 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm compared to 166 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm for B. subtilis 6051. The other two wild type strains tested, 23059 and 23856, showed a similar accumulation of isoprene as the strains described before. Corrected for the amount of cells, 23059 produced 192 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm and 23856 produced 112 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm isoprene at maximum accumulation (Table 2). To find the optimal conditions in which expression of the genes can be limited without killing the cells, each conditional mutant strain was subjected to IPTG depletion by growing the strains on agar plates containing different concentrations of IPTG varying from 0 to 1 mM. Decreasing the concentration of IPTG caused growth inhibition after overnight incubation resulting in smaller and finally no colonies (on plates without IPTG) at 37°C. Table 3 shows the minimal concentration of IPTG at which still some growth was observed for the different conditional mutant strains. This concentration of IPTG was used in our experiments and defined as the condition causing limited induction. Most mutant strains indeed showed growth inhibition at lower concentration of IPTG. The mutant strain 168IyqfY, the mutant for the putative gene encoding a homologue of the IspG protein (step 6) did not show any dependency on IPTG on plates (varying IPTG concentrations from 0 to 1 mM). Plates without IPTG incubated overnight resulted in the growth of normal colonies and the liquid cultures obtained growth curves comparable with wild type B. subtilis 168, independent of the concentration of IPTG. For some of the other mutant strains there was some growth of the bacterial cultures without IPTG as well, although severely impaired. For all conditional knock out strains isoprene emission was measured at the concentration of IPTG with limited expression in comparison to 1 mM (full induction) and no IPTG (full repression). Figure 3 represents the data for strain 168IyqiE, the conditional mutant strain for the first step in the biosynthetic pathway. Full induction of the dxs gene resulted in a normal growth curve of the bacterial culture and in an isoprene accumulation profile comparable to the profile of the wild type stain B. subtilis 168. Depletion of IPTG inhibited cell growth. The maximal concentration of isoprene accumulated in the flask and corrected for the amount of cells was 15 fold lower for the culture supplemented with 10 μM IPTG (8 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm) than for the culture with 1 mM IPTG (119 μg/ m3 / OD600 nm). Table 3 shows the maximum concentration of isoprene accumulated in the flask calculated on the amount of cells present at that time point for all tested mutant strains. Mutant strains for putative genes yluB, yacM, yabH, yacN, and yqfP encoding enzymes for respectively, steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 showed significant differences in isoprene emission, varying from a 5–28 fold decrease at limited expression levels in comparison to full induction. The knock-out strain of ypgA, putatively encoding an isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (step 8), is the only knock-out of a nonessential gene. The mutant strain showed a normal growth curve and did not show a significant difference in the emission of isoprene in comparison to the wild type strain B. subtilis 168. We also tested the function of yqiD, encoding a homologue for farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDP; 7), synthase IspA (step 9) of E. coli. Depletion of IPTG to 10 μM did not result in a significant change in the isoprene emission by the mutant strain, while it did show to be dependent on IPTG for growth."
TA038373_D_0001,"The study aimed to identify genes involved in isoprene biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis, focusing on the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. An online detection system for isoprene was developed using B. subtilis strains 6051, 23059, 23856, and 168. The emission profiles matched prior findings, validating the experimental setup. Conditional knock-out strains of putative genes (e.g., yqiE, encoding DXS) were analyzed, showing significant reductions in isoprene production when gene expression was depleted. This confirmed the role of these genes in the MEP pathway and demonstrated the potential for engineering B. subtilis for terpenoid production.","To identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of the highly volatile compound isoprene, an efficient online detection system for this terpenoid (precursor) in the air above bacterial cultures was developed. Since the B. subtilis strains 6051, 23059, and 23856 were known to emit isoprene (Kuzma et al.), we used these strains to set up the detection system for B. subtilis 168 for which the genome has been sequenced (Kunst et al.) and functional knock outs have been made. All four strains emitted isoprene in our experiment. The differences in the amounts of isoprene emitted corresponded with the levels as described before, where B. subtilis 6051 and B. subtilis 23059 emitted higher amounts than B. subtilis 23856 (Kuzma et al.). Since B. subtilis 168 showed emission of isoprene, the use of the experimental set up to investigate the isoprene synthesis by the mutant strains was justified. From the profile of isoprene emission with a maximum at the transition of the growth curve from the logarithmic phase to the stationary phase, it was concluded that from this time point on maximum isoprene concentrations had been reached and that amounts sampled from the culture every 15 min exceeded the production of new isoprene. We could not detect isoprene production in three phases using standard incubation in a shaking flask as has been described for B. subtilis 6051 grown in a bioreactor. The conditional knock out strain of the yqiE encoding DXS, the transketolase responsible for the first step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, appeared to be highly dependent on IPTG. The dramatic decrease in isoprene production at low concentration of IPTG supported the role of this gene in the biosynthetic pathway of isoprene. yqiE has been identified as dxs encoding 1-d-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate in B. subtilis before (Harker and Bramley; Hecht et al.). However, the confirming results for this mutant strain proved that the experimental set up of our work was valid to investigate the function of the other putative genes. Apparently, the isoprene emission is severely decreased when genes in the pathway are expressed at lower level than in the wild type strain."
TA038373_D_0002,"The study confirmed the involvement of genes yluB, yacM, yabH, yacN, and yqfP in the MEP pathway, as their knock-outs significantly reduced isoprene production. The nonessential gene ypgA (encoding Idi type II) did not affect isoprene emission, suggesting alternative pathways for DMADP synthesis. The gene yqfY showed no impact, possibly due to promoter leakage. The downstream gene yqiD (encoding IspA) also did not influence isoprene emission, contradicting the overflow metabolite hypothesis. The findings provide a foundation for metabolic engineering to optimize terpenoid production in B. subtilis.","For the putative genes yluB, yacM, yabH, yacN, and yqfP, encoding homologues of the enzymatic steps 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, the isoprene accumulation of the conditional knock outs by depletion of IPTG clearly proved the involvement of these genes in the biosynthetic pathway isoprene. B. subtilis 168IyqfY (step 6) did not depend on IPTG and therefore nothing can be concluded from the data obtained with this mutant strain other than that this enzyme may be highly efficient leading to complementation already obtained at the low expression levels caused by leaking activity of the Pspac promoter (Zanen et al.). The nonessential gene ypgA encodes a homologue protein for an isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (Idi) (step 8). The B. subtilis gene ypgA encodes for a so-called isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase type II protein (Takagi et al.), while the genome of E. coli harbours a gene for a different Idi type I enzyme (Hahn et al.). Interestingly, all archaea contain the Idi type II and all eukaryotes contain Idi type I. In genomes of eubacteria both are found, but there are also genomes without any of the described genes (Boucher and Doolittle). In contrast to all other genes investigated in this study, the gene ypgA encoding for the IdiII was shown to be a nonessential gene in B. subtilis (Takagi et al.). We also observed that the knock-out mutant of the bacterial strain is viable and produces isoprene. The idiI gene of E. coli has also been shown to be nonessential. Deletion mutants of this gene were viable on minimal medium (Hahn et al.). Our findings, that the isoprene emission is not influenced by the knock out of the ypgA gene, can be explained by the enzymatic mechanism of the IspH protein, step 7, before the isomerase. IDP and DMADP can be synthesized independently by the catalytic action of IspH. A hypothetical mechanism for this reaction has been described (Eisenreich et al.). This supports the nonessential character of the gene. The presence of isoprene proves that the isomer DMADP is still synthesized in the mutant and that the cells do not depend on the isomerase for the production of DMADP from IDP only. The isomerase functions in the balance of IDP and DMADP as a salvage protein (Eisenreich et al.). The first enzymatic biosynthetic step downstream the formation of the precursors IDP and DMADP is catalyzed by IspA, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (step 9). Therefore the putative gene is not involved in the biosynthesis of isoprene itself. The observation that isoprene is still emitted while the expression of the gene was depleted is easily explained by its function in the pathway downstream of IDP biosynthesis. Although some accumulation of the precursors IDP and DMADP could be expected by blocking yqiD, no significant differences in the flux toward the isoprene emission were detected. Apparently the efflux of isoprene is not influenced by the changes in FDP synthesis downstream in the isoprenoid pathway. This can be regarded as a contradiction to the hypothesis that isoprene emission functions as an efflux of an overflow metabolite."
TA038373_D_0003,"The study established the functional roles of several B. subtilis genes in the MEP pathway, with five genes (yluB, yacM, yabH, yacN, yqfP) confirmed as essential for isoprene production. The nonessential nature of ypgA and the lack of impact from yqfY and yqiD knock-outs were also noted. The findings open avenues for metabolic engineering to enhance terpenoid production, including valuable pharmaceuticals like artemisinin and paclitaxel. Future research could explore the identification of an isoprene synthase in B. subtilis to further optimize terpenoid yields.","In this study the involvement of several B. subtilis genes in the MEP pathway to isoprene was established by studying isoprene emission of mutants. Five genes, essential for viability, yluB, yacM, yabH, yacN, and yqfP, were shown to be essential for the isoprene production as well. Where these genes were at first instance depicted based on homology of the encoding proteins, the results of this study proved the functional involvement of the genes in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids on a biochemical level. A knockout of the sixth candidate gene, yqfY, did not yield a reduction in isoprene emission, nor a growth retardation, which might be explained by a not fully repressed Pspac promoter present in vector pMUTIN3. Knock-outs of the two other genes investigated in this study, showing no growth retardation as well as no reduction in isoprene emission, behaved in accordance with expectation. Although it remains unknown why isoprene is emitted by bacteria, the knowledge about the pathway to isoprene can be used for further investigations towards a better understanding of the metabolic flux to IDP and its physiological function. Next to that the IDP pool can be optimized by metabolic pathway engineering, creating a B. subtilis strain as an efficient Gram-positive host for the heterologous production of terpenoids, like the valuable plant-derived pharmaceuticals artemisinin and paclitaxel. The potential of using heterologous production organisms for the supply of terpenoids is already under investigation for E. coli and for several yeast strains (Martin et al.; Lindahl et al.; Ro et al.; Dejong et al.). For the purpose of metabolic pathway engineering it is interesting to search for a gene encoding isoprene synthase in B. subtilis as well. Evidence for an enzymatic bioconversion and the identification of this specific enzyme could give the possibility to block the efflux of isoprene thereby increasing the amount of isoprenoid available for the synthesis of terpenoids."
TA049273_I_0001,"The study investigates the fumigant potential of five edible essential oils against Sitophilus oryzae and analyzes their phytochemical residues in treated rice grains, highlighting peppermint oil as the most effective.","In the present study, we investigated the fumigant potential of five edible essential oils (EOs) against Sitophilus oryzae and their phytochemical residues in treated grains. Among the tested EOs, peppermint oil proved significantly effective (P ≤ 0.05) on S.oryzae at 400 μl/L air concentration, inducing 83 and 100% mortalities in with-food and without-food conditions respectively over 72 h exposure. In addition, it was also observed that the binary mixtures of peppermint + lemon oil (1:1 ratio) produced an equivalent effect to that of peppermint oil alone treatments. The phytochemical residue analysis by GC-MS revealed the presence of six compounds upon 72 h exposure to EOs. Further, the analysis of physico-chemical properties of the compounds indicated a positive correlation between polar surface area (PSA) and its residual nature. The residue levels of eugenol were significantly elevated corresponding to its high PSA value (29) in clove and cinnamon oils. On the other hand, the compounds with zero PSA value imparted very less or no (D-Limonene, caryophyllene, pinene and terpinolene) residues in treated grains. With respect to the most active peppermint oil, L-menthone, menthyl acetate and eucalyptol residues were at 67, 41 and 23% levels respectively. The outcome of the present study indicate the peppermint oil as a potent fumigant against S. oryzae, and although the residues of phytochemicals in treated grains is higher; they belong to the generally recognised as safe (GRAS) status leaving no harmful effect."
TA049273_I_0002,"The introduction discusses the potential of essential oils as alternatives to conventional pesticides, their phytochemical composition, and the need for further research on their residues and commercial use, particularly in controlling the rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae.","Plant essential oils (EOs) are considered as alternatives to conventional pesticides and have been well documented for their toxicity on stored product insect pests. Nearly, 3000 EOs has been reported from plants and about 10% of oils are commercially used as flavour and fragrants. Naturally, EOs are derived from different parts of plant tissues, which play a vital role in plant defense system. The EOs comprises of complex mixture of phytochemicals belonging to multiple groups and is responsible for various bioactivities in target insect pests. Among the phytochemicals in EOs, terpenes are known to have high vapour pressure and can easily diffuse in air at normal atmosphere. Monoterpenes (C10H16) are volatile in nature and are responsible for fumigant actions in EOs. Many studies have demonstrated the fumigant action of monoterpenes (e.g., limonene, menthone, eugenol, eucalyptol and menthol) against a range of insect pests. Most recently, Isman and Grieneisen stated that insecticide research on essential oils has increased nearly 15% during the past decade. However, no information is available in the literature regarding the commercialization of EO based fumigants for stored product insect control. In India, phytochemical based pesticides for commercial use are very less and EO based fumigants are nil as per Central Insecticides Board and Registration Committee. Thus, alternative strategies and adequate data are required to formulate EO based fumigants. Rajendran and Sriranjini had suggested that, further studies are required to understand the phytochemical residue/sorption levels on different food commodities and in EOs mixtures to validate the potentiality of EO based fumigants for stored product insect pest control. However, very less reports are available currently on the phytochemical residual analysis in EO fumigated commodities considering their high molecular weight and low vapour pressure. Similarly, the data on commercial use of EOs as food preservative agents remains unclear in the context of phytochemical residues and their toxicities. The rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) is one of the most destructive and cosmopolitan insect pest of stored cereals worldwide. Presently, phosphine is predominantly used across the globe to eradicate this pest species effectively from the infested commodities. Due to resistance development in insects, the target concentration of phosphine required to achieve 100% insect control has increased from 80 ppm to 1000 ppm during the years 1992 to 2001. Reddy et al. stated that, complete mortality of Sitophilus spp. population can be achieved at a dosage of 1 g/m3 phosphine held for seven days. Consequently, it is also known that, S. oryzae is one of the most tolerant species and had rapidly developed strong resistance to phosphine. A wide range of plant based EOs have been screened for insecticidal activity targeting different modes of action on different insect species. However, the reports pertaining to phytochemical residue analysis on fumigated commodities still remains less. Therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to validate the fumigant potential of five edible EOs viz., Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), Clove (Syzygium aromaticum), Lemon (Citrus limon L.), Orange (Citrus aurantium) and Peppermint (Mentha piperita) against S. oryzae and to determine their phytochemical residues in treated rice grains. The fumigant toxicity of EOs on S. oryzae was compared in with and without-food conditions and the residual levels of active ingredients were also analysed. In addition, composition and physico-chemical properties of phytochemicals have been correlated with their residual property and accordingly discussed in this article."

Fumigant bioassays were conducted using glass tubes with filter paper strips, testing individual EOs, binary mixtures, and phytocompounds at varying concentrations. Mortality data were analyzed using Abbott’s formula, ANOVA, and probit analysis. GC-MS was employed for phytochemical residue analysis, with compounds identified via mass spectra and retention indices.","HPLC grade solvents, EOs of five selected plants viz., cinnamon, clove, lemon, orange and peppermint and phytochemicals (eucalyptol, neoisocarvomenthol, menthone and menthyl acetate) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Ltd, India. Aluminium phosphide tablets ‘Quickphos’ (United Phosphorus Ltd., Mumbai, India) was obtained from commercial pesticide supplier. Rice grains (Raw rice, MR-gold variety) used for the experiment was procured from Local Super Market, Mysore, Karnataka, India. The obtained rice grains were held at -20°C in deep freezer (Blue Star, HF 300 model) for a week to disinfest any field carried infestation. The typical moisture content of the rice grains used for the experiment was about 12%. Insect cultures of rice weevil, S. oryzae was regularly maintained in the insectary unit (with controlled condition 30±2°C, 75±5% humidity and 13:11—light:dark photoperiod) in Food Protectants and Infestation Control department at CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore. A group (approximately 1000 individuals) of S. oryzae adults obtained from the stock culture were introduced into 2 L capacity individual glass jars containing 1 Kg rice grains. The insect culture was under regular observation until enough adults were developed. From this sub culture, adults of similar age groups were obtained and used for fumigant toxicity studies. Individual EOs, phytochemicals and binary mixtures of EOs were performed in fumigant bioassays. Glass tubes (28 x 114 mm; 50 ml capacity) fitted with glass stoppers were used for performing the fumigation bioassays. Whatmann No. 1 filter paper strips (20 mm square) were prepared and pasted to the lower side of stopper. The top layer of each tube (about one inch length from the filter paper) was lined with Insect-A-slip to avoid insects coming in direct contact with the filter paper strips. All EOs, phytochemicals and binary mixtures were evaluated for fumigant toxicity both in with and without-food conditions. For fumigant bioassays under with-food conditions, 5 gm of rice was added to each tube. Ten individual adults of 15 days old were released into each tube. Among them, three highly active EOs were chosen to study the effect of binary mixtures of EO combinations in 1:1 ratio. Based on the individual EO fumigant bioassay results, major phytocompounds from the most active EO was selected for further studies. Different concentrations viz., 20, 100, 200, 400 μl/L air of EOs (including binary mixtures i.e., peppermint+lemon, peppermint+orange and lemon+orange) and phytocompound samples were loaded onto the filter paper. After loading each test concentrations, the open end of the individual tube was held with stoppers and further sealed with thin polythene films to make it air tight. Phosphine gas was used as a positive control for the phytocompound fumigant bioassay. Phosphine gas generation and fumigant dosing at various concentrations (20, 100, 200, 400 μl/L air) was carried out by following Manivannan et al., method. Three sets were maintained for each of the treatment to observe mortalities at 24, 48 and 72 h exposures respectively. Likewise, the entire experiment was repeated in five replications."

GC-MS analysis was performed using a PerkinElmer system with an Elite-5 capillary column, helium carrier gas, and specific temperature protocols. Compounds were identified by comparing mass spectra and retention indices with NIST library data. Relative and residual concentrations were calculated using statistical formulas. The study confirmed peppermint oil's efficacy and identified phytochemical residues, correlating polar surface area (PSA) with residue levels.","After 72 h exposure to respective EOs, the treated rice samples were extracted from the tubes and were subjected to phytochemical residue analysis. The fumigated rice grains obtained from all the five replicates were pooled together for phytochemical residue analysis. Accordingly, twenty-five grams of rice in each concentration was soaked in methanol at 1:3 (rice: methanol; w/v) ratio. The residual extract of each sample was collected and filtered through Whatmann No. 1 filter paper. Likewise, the extraction procedure was repeated thrice for each test sample. Obtained residual extracts were concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator. The final concentrates of the phytochemical extracts were stored in deep freezer (-20°C) for further GC-MS analysis. The GC-MS analysis was performed on a Perkinelmer system equipped with Turbo mass Gold mass spectrometer (Norwalk, CT. USA). Elite-5 capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) was used for analysis. Helium served as the carrier gas and all the samples were analyzed by the following specifications; Initial temp 40°C for 2 min, ramp 5°C/min to 290°C, Inj = 250°C, Volume = 1 μL, Split = 10:1, Delay: 5.00 min, Transfer Temp = 200°C, Source Temp = 180°C, Scan: 29 to 400Da. Compounds were identified by comparison of their respective mass spectra, retention indices (Kovats index) and above 40% of relative abundance of acceptance match criteria with those of standards and by comparing with the NIST mass spectral data system/library. After the fumigant bioassays were complete, the per cent corrected mortalities were estimated following Abbot’s formula for each of the treatment and represented along with their mean and standard error; percentage corrected mortality = (percentage mortality in treatment—percentage mortality in control/100—percentage mortality in control) x 100. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple range tests were performed for the mortality data to determine the significant difference between treatments and to identify the effective treatment at P ≤ 0.05 for further binary mixture studies. Lethal concentration for 50% mortality (LC50) was estimated for 72 h exposure for all the EOs and binary mixtures by probit analysis. ANOVA and probit analysis were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 16.0). From the GC-MS data, relative concentration (RLC) and residue concentration (RSC) of each component in percentage was calculated by following formulas: RLC = (Component area / Total area) x 100; RSC = [(Sample area x Volume of sample) / (Reference area x Volume of reference)] x 100."
TA049273_R_0001,"The study investigated the fumigant potential of five essential oils (EOs) against Sitophilus oryzae (rice weevil) and their phytochemical residues in treated rice grains. Peppermint oil was the most effective, showing significant mortality rates (83% with-food, 100% without-food) at 400 μl/L air concentration over 72 hours. Binary mixtures of peppermint and lemon oil (1:1 ratio) showed similar efficacy. GC-MS analysis identified six residual compounds, with polar surface area (PSA) correlating positively with residue levels. Eugenol, with high PSA, left significant residues, while compounds like D-limonene and pinene left minimal or no residues. Peppermint oil's residues (L-menthone, menthyl acetate, eucalyptol) were substantial but considered safe (GRAS status).","In the present study, we investigated the fumigant potential of five edible essential oils (EOs) against Sitophilus oryzae and their phytochemical residues in treated grains. Among the tested EOs, peppermint oil proved significantly effective (P ≤ 0.05) on S. oryzae at 400 μl/L air concentration, inducing 83 and 100% mortalities in with-food and without-food conditions respectively over 72 h exposure. In addition, it was also observed that the binary mixtures of peppermint + lemon oil (1:1 ratio) produced an equivalent effect to that of peppermint oil alone treatments. The phytochemical residue analysis by GC-MS revealed the presence of six compounds upon 72 h exposure to EOs. Further, the analysis of physico-chemical properties of the compounds indicated a positive correlation between polar surface area (PSA) and its residual nature. The residue levels of eugenol were significantly elevated corresponding to its high PSA value (29) in clove and cinnamon oils. On the other hand, the compounds with zero PSA value imparted very less or no (D-Limonene, caryophyllene, pinene and terpinolene) residues in treated grains. With respect to the most active peppermint oil, L-menthone, menthyl acetate and eucalyptol residues were at 67, 41 and 23% levels respectively. The outcome of the present study indicate the peppermint oil as a potent fumigant against S. oryzae, and although the residues of phytochemicals in treated grains is higher; they belong to the generally recognised as safe (GRAS) status leaving no harmful effect."
TA049273_R_0002,"Results showed concentration- and time-dependent fumigant activity of EOs against S. oryzae. Peppermint, lemon, and orange oils achieved >95% mortality at 400 μl/L air over 72 hours in without-food conditions, with peppermint oil being the most potent (LC50 = 47.8 μl/L air). With-food conditions reduced efficacy, but peppermint oil still showed 83% mortality. Eucalyptol and menthone (components of peppermint oil) also exhibited high toxicity, comparable to phosphine (positive control). Binary mixtures, particularly peppermint + lemon oil, were highly effective. GC-MS identified major compounds in each EO, with eugenol dominant in cinnamon/clove oils and D-limonene in orange/lemon oils. Residual compounds in rice grains included menthone, eucalyptol, and eugenol, with PSA influencing residue levels.","The results indicated that all the tested EOs in without-food condition exhibited concentration vs time dependent activities on S. oryzae (Table 1). After 24 h exposure, no or remarkable mortality was observed in any of the treatments, except for orange and peppermint oils which recorded 40 and 34 per cent mortalities at 400 μl/L air concentration. A minimum test concentration of 100 μl/L air was required to achieve more than 10% of mortality in S. oryzae for all the EO treatments exposed for 48 h. Among the five tested EOs, peppermint, lemon and orange oils displayed significant potential activities (>95 per cent mortality) at 400 μl/L air concentration exposed to S. oryzae over 72 h exposure (P ≤ 0.05). Complete adult mortality was recorded in peppermint and lemon oils treatments at maximum test concentration and long exposures. Mortality of the test insects decreased in fumigant bioassays carried out under with-food conditions (Table 2) than without-food (Table 1). Similar to without-food assay, adult mortality was also dependent on the concentration and exposure. However, lemon and orange oils exhibited moderate activities (55 and 46 respectively) at higher concentration and longer exposure. Maximum mortality (83%) was observed in peppermint oil treatment at 400 μl/L air concentration over 72 h exposure. Among the tested EOs, peppermint oil showed significant activities at P ≤ 0.05 at the test concentrations from 100 to 400 μl/L air over 72 h exposure. The fumigant toxicities of selected four phytocompounds on S. oryzae are depicted in Table 3. Complete mortality (100%) of S. oryzae was observed in eucalyptol and menthone treatments at 200 and 400 μl/L air concentrations over 72 h exposure under without-food conditions. In with-food condition, more than 80% mortality was recorded for eucalyptol and menthone treatments at the highest test concentrations and maximum exposure. When compared to phosphine treatment (positive control), eucalyptol and menthone showed significant activities at P ≤ 0.05 in without and with-food conditions for 400 μl/L air concentration at 72 h exposure. Followed by eucalyptol and menthone, menthyl acetate also exhibited fumigant activities. No significant mortality was noticed for neoisocarvomenthol treatments over 24 h exposure, either in without-food or with-food condition. The results of the binary mixtures of EOs from lemon, orange and peppermint oils tested against the adults of S. oryzae are presented in Table 4. All the tested binary mixtures of EOs expressed mortalities following 24 h exposure. Insect mortalities decreased in with-food assay compared to the without-food assay. Peppermint+lemon oil mixture displayed promising activities compared to other binary mixtures exposed for 72 h. The obtained mortalities over exposure to the test concentration of 400 μl/L air for 48 and 72 h exposure was significantly superior (P ≤ 0.05) over the other binary mixtures, resulting in 95 to 100% mortality. The estimated probit analysis data for S. oryzae exposed to individual EOs, phytocompounds and binary mixtures of EOs for 72 h exposure are shown in Table 5. The LC50 concentrations recorded for orange and lemon oils were less than 65 and 550 μl/L air concentration for without-food and with-food exposures respectively. Peppermint oil proved to be the potent EO fumigant, recording the least LC50 (47.8 μl/L air) and LC90 (124.4 μl/L air) values for without-food exposure compared to the other EOs. Similarly, the peppermint oil treatment also exhibited promising toxicity on S. oryzae under with-food conditions, recording least LC50 (45.2 μl/L air) and LC90 (1372.8 μl/L air) values. Moreover, the estimated fiducial limits for LC50 and LC90 concentrations, cinnamon and clove oils showed wide ranges with maximum lethal concentration values. On the other hand, the most active peppermint oil showed narrow range of fiducial limits; 32.0–66.4 and 87.2–219.6 μl/L air ranges obtained for without-food exposure and 28.0–63.4 and 732.0–3993.4 μl/L air ranges obtained for with-food exposure (LC50 and LC90 respectively). Compared to the positive control (phosphine), the phytocompounds eucalyptol and menthone showed notable LC50 and LC90 values than neoisocarvomenthol and menthyl acetate in fumigation bioassays. The LC50 and LC90 values were <55 and <150 μl/L air in without-food condition and <110 and <300 μl/L air in without-food condition for eucalyptol and menthone respectively. In the EO binary mixture bioassays, the minimal LC50 and LC90 values were noticed in peppermint+lemon oil mixture. Less than 100 μl/L air values of LC50 and LC90 values of 427.8 and 1425.4 μl/L air were obtained for peppermint+lemon oil combination in without-food and with-food exposures respectively. Narrow range of fiducial limits was obtained for peppermint+lemon oil combination than the other treatments. Phytochemical composition and RLC of compounds obtained from the tested EOs are presented in Table 6. GC-MS analysis revealed that, cinnamon, clove, orange, lemon and peppermint oils contained a total of 27, 17, 25, 23 and 25 compounds respectively. The following are the major compounds identified in the selected EOs; eugenol detected in cinnamon (76.76%) and clove (74.55%) oils, D-limonene in orange (93.48%) oil, D-limonene and α-pinene in lemon (66.60 and 17.30% respectively) oil, and neoisocarvomenthol, 1-menthone and eucalyptol in peppermint (40.55, 27.62 and 10.61% respectively) oil. The phytochemicals were classified into five categories based on the RLC levels (I = 0–5%, II = 6–20%, III = 21–45%, IV = 46–70%, V = 71–100%) in EOs for comparative analysis and presented in Table 7. No RLC value is depicted in the Table for the EO with level I, except for eugenol in orange oil which showed reasonable traces of RSC in the treated samples. The results suggest that the RSC values did not correspond to their respective RLC levels recorded in the study. Over all, about six compounds were only detected as residues in the fumigated rice grains. Menthone, menthyl acetate and eucalyptol residues were detected in peppermint oil treatments. While, eugenol residue was detected in cinnamon, clove and orange oil treatments and D-limonene and acetyl eugenol in lemon and clove oil treatments respectively. Menthone showed maximum RSC value (67.28%) followed by menthyl acetate, eucalyptol, eugenol, acetyl eugenol and D-limonene with 41.77, 23.50, 18.86 and 1.57% RSC’s respectively. While comparing the RSC of a compound with its total composition in the EO, eugenol showed maximum RSC (about 15% in clove and 20% in cinnamon oils). Fig 1 shows GC MS chromatogram of residual compounds detected in rice grains fumigated with peppermint oil. Physico-chemical properties of phytochemicals of EOs were compared with two conventional fumigants, phosphine and methyl bromide (S1 Table). RSC level was the least or nil for the compounds having zero polar surface area (PSA) and no remarkable variation was observed between the RSC and physico-chemical properties of the compounds except PSA."

TA049273_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the challenges of bio-fumigants, such as low vapor pressure and high boiling point, leading to residue absorption on commodities. Peppermint oil was highly toxic to S. oryzae, with LC50 values of 47.8 and 45.2 μl/L air in with- and without-food conditions, respectively. Binary mixtures, particularly peppermint + lemon oil, showed enhanced efficacy. Monoterpenoids like menthone and eucalyptol were key active compounds in peppermint oil. Residual analysis showed eugenol's high residue levels due to its PSA value, while compounds like D-limonene left minimal residues. The study proposes PSA as a predictor of residue adherence and discusses the oxidation of compounds like menthol isomers to menthone, influencing residue formation and insect mortality.","In spite of many investigations to explore the potential of bio-fumigants for stored product insect control, the major disadvantage is the low vapor pressure and high boiling point leading to absorption/ settling of residues on the treated commodities imparting off odors. Hence, in the present study, we comparatively investigated the fumigant toxic potentialities and the residue profiles of cinnamon, clove, lemon, orange and peppermint EOs in fumigated rice grains. Insect mortality results revealed that, all the tested EOs exerted concentration dependent toxic effects on S. oryzae. Peppermint oil was regarded as highly toxic; while lemon and orange oils were reported to be moderately toxic to S. oryzae. Previously, Khani et al. and Shaaya et al. reported 85 and 7.5 μl/L air as the LC50 concentrations for peppermint oil treatments against S. oryzae. Whereas in the present study, LC50 values of 47.8 (LCL:UCL = 32.0–66.4) and 45.2 μl/L air (LCL:UCL = 28.0–63.4) were recorded for peppermint oil in both with and without-food conditions. The LC90 values for peppermint oil increased in with-food conditions (124.4 to 1372 μl/L air) compared to without-food conditions as similar to the other oils. The obtained slope values significantly decreased (P ≤ 0.05) in with-food conditions for all oils except for the less active cinnamon oil. Hence, it was predicted that fumigant toxicities of EOs decreased under with-food conditions indicating that a proportion of active ingredients/phytochemicals might have got absorbed/adhered onto the rice grains thereby reducing the lethality. Similarly, Rajendran and Sriranjini stated that the toxicity of bio-fumigants against insect pests will be less in with-food conditions due to low vapour pressure (≤1 mmHg) and high sorption by the grains.Based on the toxicity data of the individual oils, peppermint, orange and lemon oils were selected for the binary mixture fumigant bioassays on S. oryzae. Mortality results showed that, S. oryzae was more susceptible to peppermint with lemon oil mixture at P ≤ 0.05. This mixture expressed 100% mortality at 400 μl/L air concentration in without-food condition, which decreased to 85% mortality in with-food condition exposed for 72 h. It was observed that peppermint+ lemon oil mixture (1:1) had more fumigant action than the other two mixtures. Earlier bioactivity studies have indicated that the mixtures of essential oils are more effective than individual oils. For example, Krishnarajah et al. reported that, binary mixtures of essential oils were more toxic to Sitotroga cerealella than the individual oils. This also holds good for conventional fumigants like phosphine, which showed synergistic effects on Rhyzopertha dominica when combined with CO2, and the report suggested that PH3+CO2 admixture increased the insect mortality than phosphine alone treatments. While in the present study, fumigant toxicity of peppermint oil alone was relatively par to peppermint+lemon oil mixture. Similarly, Nattudurai et al. observed that eucalyptus+camphor oil mixture had similar effects (LC50) on Tribolium castaneum as posed by the individual oils. In the present study, similar to the results of individual oils, the slope values for the binary mixtures greatly varied between with and without-food conditions. This strongly indicated that the toxicity of EOs is altered by the sorptive nature of the commodity.Monoterpenoids in EOs are known to play a vital role in mitigating fumigant actions on stored product insect pests. Consequently in the present study, peppermint oil showed promising activities due to the presence of major monoterpenoids such as eucalyptol and menthone. When compared to the commercial fumigant (phosphine), menthone and eucalyptol alone treatments showed significant activities at P ≤ 0.05 and were identified as active compounds in peppermint oil exhibiting fumigant activities. Likewise, orange and lemon oils offered moderate toxicities on S. oryzae attributed by the presence of D-limonene and α-pinene monoterpenoid compounds. Previously, Lee et al. suggested that menthone had more fumigant potential followed by α-pinene and limonene. Later, eucalyptol was also recognised as potent fumigant against S. oryzae, T. castaneum and R. dominica as described by Lee et al.. The present study also insists the fact that, not all monoterpenoids found in EOs possess fumigant actions. Though, eugenol belongs to monoterpenoid group, it displayed less activity against S. oryzae, despite having a RLC value around 75% in cinnamon and clove oils. Similarly, Liska et al. also reported that eugenol was not effective as a fumigant against T. castaneum.It is imperative that, a thorough knowledge on residual properties of EOs is essential to formulate a bio-fumigant. The present phytochemical residual analysis revealed that, only six compounds settle/adhere on the rice grains out of the total detected compounds in individual EO. Among the tested five EOs, phytochemical residues of eugenol (14–20% of RSC per oil) was remarkably higher in clove and cinnamon oils than the other oils. Further, it was also observed that RSC of phytochemicals were associated with their respective PSAs. It is known that PSA is the electrostatic potential of a substance/compound to form physical interactions between surfaces. Palm et al. stated that PSA has been used for prediction of absorption of drugs in pharmaceutical industry. Accordingly, in the present study, we propose a positive correlation between the PSA values of phytocompounds from EOs with their residual nature. For instance, the residues of major compounds like acetyl eugenol, eucalyptol, eugenol, L-menthone and menthyl acetate were more and correlated with their respective PSA values. The phytochemical analysis of eugenol showed notable RLC and corresponding RSC levels in cinnamon and clove oils. While for orange oil, though the RLC level was very low for eugenol, remarkable RSC was noticed due to its high PSA value (29). Similarly, the RLC values were less for acetyl eugenol and menthyl acetate compounds, whereas the RSC values were more, mainly attributed by its high PSA values (36 and 26 respectively). Contrastingly it was observed that, though D-limonene was a major compound in orange (93%) and lemon (66%) oils, the obtained RSC was very less (0.10% of RSC per oil) in lemon and was not detected in orange oil, due to its zero PSA value. Similarly, the PSA value for the other non-residual compounds such as caryophyllene, pinene and terpinolene is zero though their RLC values were about 6–20% in the respective oils. More interestingly, PSA value and RLC level of L-menthone was less in peppermint oil when compared to eugenol in cinnamon and clove oils though the detected residues were very high (40–70%). In contrast, though PSA and RLC values were at noticeable levels for isomenthol and neoisocarvomenthol compounds they did not impart any residue in the fumigated rice grains. These facts denote the instability of the compounds and probable chemical reactions taking place during fumigations. To support this view, Belitz et al., stated that terpene hydrocarbons undergo rapid autooxidation at atmospheric air in many of the essential oils. Hence it was assumed/predicted that menthol isomers (isomenthol and neoisocarvomenthol) might have autooxidized to L-menthone leading to more residue formation. In addition, it is known that isomenthol and neoisocarvomenthol were not stable when compared to menthol because of an axial methyl group and may rapidly get oxidized to menthone. Interestingly, in the present study it was noticed that insect mortality was nil for neoisocarvomenthol in with-food condition and about 50% mortality (at 400 μl/L air concentration and 72 h exposure) was observed in without-food condition. Probably, it was assumed that, in without-food condition, direct exposure/contact of oxidized neoisocarvomenthol (i.e., menthone) on insects might have induced mortality. On the other hand, in with-food condition, a proportion of oxidized neoisocarvomenthol might have settled on rice grains and the actual concentration required to induce insect mortality may be lacking. Krishnaswamy described the oxidation mechanism of menthol and their isomers into menthone isomers. Furthermore, Pecar and Gorsek had described the reaction kinetics of menthol getting oxidized to menthone under laboratory conditions. According to Lee et al., residual level of phytocompound on the commodity is dependent on the quantity of compound being absorbed. In addition, Cartalade and Vernhet stated that, maximum adsorption of phytochemical was associated to the PSA of the material. Similarly, in the present study, the compounds such as acetyl eugenol, eugenol, menthone and menthyl acetate have more PSA values subsequently imparting higher levels of residues in treated grains. Hence, it is proposed that the PSA value may determine the residual property of compounds getting adhered to the surface of commodity.Furthermore, Reddy et al. stated that sorption/residue of fumigants on commodities is mainly dependent on the moisture content of the grain, size of particle, composition of fumigant agent, exposure phase and dose. Likewise, the conventional fumigants, phosphine and methyl bromide have zero PSA value thereby the residue formation in fumigated commodities will be very less."

TA049273_C_0002,"The discussion highlights peppermint oil as a potent bio-fumigant for controlling S. oryzae in stored rice, either alone or mixed with lemon oil. The major residual compounds (e.g., L-menthone, menthyl acetate, eucalyptol, eugenol) are GRAS-listed, posing no health risks. Aeration may further reduce residues, as suggested by prior studies. Peppermint oil is also exempt from FIFRA regulations, supporting its safe use. The study concludes that peppermint oil is a viable, low-risk alternative for pest control in stored commodities.","Our study signifies that peppermint oil is a potent bio/phyto-fumigant and could be used for the control of S. oryzae under storage conditions. In addition, the study implies that peppermint oil can also be used in mixed form with lemon oil for effective fumigations. With respect to the phytochemical residues, the identified major residual compounds such as 1-menthone, menthyl acteate, eucalyptal and eugenol, and their respective oils are generally recognised as safe (GRAS). Accordingly, we study suggests that, peppermint and lemon oils can be considered as safer alternatives for commodity treatments. Also, the phytochemical residues could be probably removed by 24 hours aeration, as suggested by Lee et al. for eucalyptol compound. Likely, the residual compounds in peppermint oil fumigated grains may also be removed upon aeration. In addition, Isman reviewed that residues from edible EOs are beneficial to human health by pass through diet. Furthermore, peppermint oil is exempted from Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) for pesticide formulation in alone or in combination with other ingredients. Hence, our study suggests peppermint oil as a potent bio-fumigant and could be applied with the reduced residual risk under direct exposure to commodities in alone or in mixture with lemon oil for the control of S. oryzae in stored product commodities."
TA041776_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the challenges of water scarcity in Iran, its impact on plant productivity, and the adverse effects of chemical fertilizers, proposing biofertilizers like arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria as sustainable alternatives to enhance plant performance under drought stress.","Iran receives approximately two-thirds less rainfall than the global average. Over 88% of Iran’s farmlands are in arid and semi-arid regions. Water scarcity conditions, or drought stress, have a detrimental impact on plant functioning. This includes a decrease in root growth and nutrient absorption, a reduction in photosynthesis capacity, and an increase in the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation within the plant’s membranes. Plants’ reaction to water deficit stress is contingent upon its severity and duration, leading to a decrease in plant productivity ranging from 13% to 94%. Furthermore, insufficient soil moisture diminishes the activity of the microbial population. This decrease hampers the accessibility and solubility of nutrients for plants. Moreover, the increased utilization of chemical fertilizers to attain peak crop yields amplifies production expenses, elevates the risk of environmental pollution, and poses threats to both human and animal well-being. Utilizing biofertilizers such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) to decrease or even eliminate chemical input usage presents a commendable resolution to address these apprehensions within the realm of sustainable agriculture. Biofertilizers contain beneficial bacteria and fungi that convert essential nutrients from inaccessible to accessible forms during biological processes. Studies have indicated that PGPR can stimulate plant development by producing diverse compounds. These bacteria assist in element absorption, atmospheric nitrogen stabilization, mineral solubilization like phosphate, and the synthesis of plant hormones such as auxins and gibberellins. These activities collectively enhance plant performance. Furthermore, PGPR can alleviate the adverse effects of stressful conditions such as drought and salinity. They achieve this by modifying root morphology, augmenting the buildup of osmolytes within plant cells, and enhancing water uptake mechanisms. Inoculating plant roots with AMF presents another auspicious and productive approach to enhancing plant performance and resilience under drought-stress conditions. The symbiotic relationship between AMF and over 80% of plant species has a constructive impact on plant growth. It achieves this by augmenting the uptake of inorganic nutrients and water, elevating the rate of photosynthesis, and fostering the production of both primary and secondary metabolites. These metabolites are pivotal in bolstering plants’ ability to withstand and endure stressful conditions."
TA041776_I_0002,"The introduction discusses the cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants in arid regions, focusing on Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss., its medicinal properties, and the potential of biofertilizers to improve its essential oil quality and yield under water deficit stress.","One of the viable strategies for achieving thriving agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions involves cultivating drought-resistant plants. Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) cultivation has gained prominence in these challenging environments due to their remarkable resilience to adverse conditions. Despite stress, MAPs can sustain their performance by synthesizing secondary metabolites, including alkaloids and phenolic compounds. indicated that water deficit stress decreased chlorophyll content, relative water content, grain yield, biological yield, and essential oil yield of dragon head compared to the control. showed that applying AMF and PGPR while reducing the adverse effects of drought stress by providing nutrients of N, P, and K improves the quality of fennel essential oil. stated that the application of AMF and PGPR on Melissa officinalis L. plants could alleviate the adverse effects of water scarcity by boosting leaf water potential, the efficiency of carbon dioxide use, transpiration rate, nutrient availability, water supply to roots. Moreover, Melissa officinalis L. plants’ growth, development, and dry weight yield can also improve under water deficit stress. Dragon head (D. kotschyi Boiss.) is a member of the Lamiaceae family and holds the distinction of being an endemic and endangered plant species native to Iran. This plant possesses antispasmodic, antibacterial, and analgesic properties, making it extensively utilized for addressing issues such as pain, seizures, fever, inflammation, rheumatic pain, and wound healing. It has been reported that the main constituents of essential oil (EO) in D. kotschyi Boiss. differ due to different environmental conditions but mainly include α-pinene, limonene, β-bourbonene, geranial, terpinene-4-ol, etc.. Limonene, one of the main components of D. kotschyi Boiss. EO is effective as an anti-tumour, antiviral, bactericidal, cancer prevention agent, anti-candida, expectorant, fungus growth inhibitor, anti-spasm and pain reliever. Furthermore, beyond diminishing the effectiveness of chemical fertilizers under water scarcity conditions, the extensive application of these fertilizers also adversely impacts the bioactive compounds in MAPs. Hence, substituting chemical fertilizers with environmentally friendly biofertilizers to enhance nutrient uptake and augment plant resilience to water stress becomes imperative. Moreover, the impact of biofertilizers on perennial plants, such as cumin, remains inadequately investigated under drought stress circumstances, and there exists a dearth of substantial information in this domain. Consequently, the primary objective of this study was to delve into the influence of AMF and plant PGPR on the agronomic traits, dry yield, and the phytochemical and physiological characteristics of D. kotschyi Boiss. cultivated under conditions of water scarcity. Our working hypotheses were as follows: (i) the combined application of AMF and PGPR would alleviate the adverse effects caused by water deficit stress; (ii) the introduction of AMF and PGPR would enhance both the quantity and quality of essential oil production under water deficit stress conditions; and (iii) the inoculation of AMF and PGPR would contribute to improved growth, biochemical attributes, and physiological responses in D. kotschyi Boiss. when confronted with water deficit stress."
TA041776_M_0001,"The study was conducted in a controlled environment in Iran during the 2019 growing season to evaluate the effects of different irrigation regimes and biofertilizers on Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss. A factorial randomized complete block design was used with three replications. Irrigation regimes included well watering (100% field capacity), mild water stress (80% field capacity), and severe water stress (60% field capacity). Biofertilizer treatments included control (no biofertilizer), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), and a combination of AMF and PGPR. Soil properties were analyzed, and plants were cultivated in pots with uniform soil conditions. PGPR and AMF were applied to seeds and soil, respectively.","The study was undertaken during the 2019 growing season within a controlled environment at Shahid Bakri Miandoab, situated in West Azerbaijan, Iran (45°10′E, 37°44′N, and an elevation of 1,338 m above sea level). The primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of distinct irrigation regimes and biofertilizers on the morphological, physiological, and phytochemical attributes of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. The experimental design employed a factorial approach within a randomized complete block arrangement, with each treatment combination being replicated three times. The initial factor under investigation pertained to distinct irrigation regimes, namely optimal irrigation, denoted watering at 100% field capacity (WW) to maintain moisture without inducing stress; moderate water stress involving irrigation at 80% field capacity (MWS); and pronounced water stress entailing irrigation at 60% field capacity (SWS). The second factor centered on the administration of biofertilizers, encompassing a control group devoid of biofertilizer application, the introduction of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), and a concurrent application of both AMF and PGPR. Table 1 presents a comprehensive summary of the chemical and physical attributes of the soil, analyzed at a depth ranging from 0 to 30 cm. Meanwhile, Figure 1 depicts the average monthly rainfall and air temperature measurements. The experimental arrangement entailed the utilization of pots with dimensions measuring 80 × 25 × 25 cm, each uniformly filled with soil to an equivalent level. Ten plants were cultivated within each pot, and the planting commenced in mid-March. The plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), acquired from Green Biotech Ltd., recognized as Zist Fanavar Sabz in Persian, constituted a composite comprising phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (Bacillus lentus and Pseudomonas putida) at a concentration of 109 active bacteria per gram, nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Azotobacter) at a concentration of 109 active bacteria per gram, and potassium-solubilizing bacteria (Pseudomonas genus) at a concentration of 108 active bacteria per gram. The contents of the packets were blended with sterile distilled water and subsequently applied as a spray onto the seeds of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. This procedure ensured the establishment of a consistent coating on the seed surface. The biofertilizer containing AMF, specifically Myco-root® sourced from Zist Fanavar Sabz Company in Iran, encompassed a trio of species: Glomus mossea, Glomus etunicatum, and Glomus intraradices. This study introduced the AMF biofertilizer into the designated treatments by incorporating it into the soil beneath the planted seedlings. For each pot, 50 grams of the AMF treatment were meticulously combined with the soil. The cultivation area was divided into six rows, each spaced at a 10 cm interval. Subsequently, the seedlings were positioned within the same row, maintaining a separation of 10 cm between each seedling, and were planted at a depth of three cm."
TA041776_M_0002,"During the flowering stage, plants were harvested, and dry yield was measured after drying. Essential oil was extracted from dried plant material using hydrodistillation and analyzed using GC-MS and GC-FID to identify and quantify compounds. Chlorophyll, carotenoid, relative water content, proline, and soluble sugar levels were measured using spectrophotometric methods. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Duncan’s multiple range test to determine significant differences between treatments.","During the stage of 50% flowering, a random selection of five plants was made from each pot to evaluate yield components and agronomic characteristics. The above-ground portion of the Dorema kotschyi Boiss. The plant was harvested and dried in a forced-air oven set at 68 °C for 72 h. Following a two-day interval, the dried plant material was weighed to ascertain the dry yield measure. The D. kotschyi Boiss. EO was extracted from 40 g dried aerial parts, ground and inserted into 1 L glass flasks filled with 300 mL of distilled water. Then, they were boiled for 3 h to exhaust the whole plant material. The EO was collected in specific glass containers after adding sodium sulphate and kept at 4 °C in the darkness until GC-FID and GC–MS analyses. Also, the EO yield, as g plant−1, was calculated by multiplying the dry yield with EO content. After extraction of EO, the required amount of sodium sulphate was added, and samples were kept at 4 °C in darkness for further chemical analysis. Moreover, the EO constituents of D. kotschyi Boiss. were analyzed using GC-MS (7890/5975A GC/MSD; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and GC-FID (7990B; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). For GC–MS analysis, an Agilent 7890A-5975C gas chromatograph manufactured in the United States was employed. This chromatograph was equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column comprising a 5% phenyl methylpolysiloxane composition, with dimensions of 30 m in length, an inner diameter of 0.25 mm, and a film thickness of 0.25 µm. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: an initial duration of 3 min at 80 °C, followed by a subsequent increase of 8 °C per minute until reaching 180 °C, which was then maintained for 10 min. The transfer line temperature was set at 240 °C. The carrier gas employed was helium, flowing at 1 ml per minute. The injector employed a split ratio of 1:50, and mass range acquisition occurred within the range of 40 to 500 m/z in electron impact (EI) mode at an energy of 70 electron volts (eV). The essential oil constituents (EO) were identified per the procedure outlined by. In brief, the components’ retention indices (RIs) were determined by comparing them with a standard mixture of n-alkanes (C7-C28) from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The calculated RIs and the corresponding mass spectra were compared against entries within commercial libraries and existing literature sources (; NIST 08, 2008). To aid in identifying the major components, authentic standards available from Sigma-Aldrich were also co-injected. An Agilent 7890, an instrument produced by Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) was utilized for the GC-FID analysis. This instrument was coupled with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and an HP-5 capillary column identical to the previous one. The oven temperature profile remained consistent with the conditions above. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 230 °C and 240 °C, respectively. The quantification, presented as relative percentages, was carried out following the procedure established by. During the flowering stage, fresh leaf samples weighing 0.5 g were subjected to homogenization in 10 ml of 80% acetone. The resultant homogenate underwent centrifugation at 12,000 g and a temperature of 4 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was measured at wavelengths of 663 nm, 645 nm, and 470 nm, employing a UV spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). The quantification of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid content was accomplished using the equations established by. The units for plant pigments were expressed as milligrams per gram of fresh weight. The weight of ten mature leaves was determined as their initial fresh weight (LFW). Subsequently, these samples were placed in distilled water at a temperature of 4 °C, and the weight of the turgid leaves was recorded after 24 h (LTW). Following this, the leaves were dried in an oven set at 70 °C for 48 h, and their weight as dry leaves was measured (LDW). Lastly, the relative water content (RWC) was computed using the formula provided by. Fresh leaf samples weighing 0.5 grams each were pulverized using liquid nitrogen. These ground samples were combined with a 10 ml solution containing 3% sulfosalicylic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 times the force of gravity (g) for 10 min. Following centrifugation, 2 ml of the resulting supernatant was carefully transferred into a fresh tube. To this supernatant, 2 ml of acid-ninhydrin solution and 2 ml of glacial acetic acid were added and thoroughly mixed. The resulting mixtures were then subjected to heat within a water bath set at 100 °C for one hour. Subsequently, the mixtures were rapidly cooled by placing them in an ice bath. A total of 4 ml of toluene were introduced to the cooled mixtures, and vigorous vortexing was performed for 20 s. Finally, the supernatant was analyzed spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 520 nanometers, with the proline content being quantified and expressed as micromoles per gram of fresh weight using the methodology established by. The phenol and sulfuric acid methods were used to measure soluble sugar content. A total of 0.5 g of fresh leaves were homogenized with ethanol and mixed with 98% sulfuric acid and 5% phenol. This mixture was left for one hour, and its absorption was measured by a spectrophotometer at 485 nm. Analysis of variance for the results was performed using the generalized linear model (GLM) model SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) software and the effects of irrigation regimes, the application of biofertilizers and the interactions between these two variables were evaluated by ANOVA. Means were compared using Duncan’s multiple range test, and differences between individual means were considered significant at p < 0.05. The graphs were drawn in Excel."

Additionally, the main effect of irrigation and biofertilizer emerged as significant on parameters such as dry yield, essential oil (EO) content, EO yield, carotenoid content, and relative water content (RWC). The tallest plants, measuring 65 cm, were observed under optimal irrigation conditions (WW) when both AMF and PGPR were applied simultaneously. Nonetheless, no noteworthy contrast in plant height was observed with the discrete application of these two biofertilizers. Conversely, the most diminutive plants, standing at 37 cm, were observed in severe water stress (SWS), devoid of any biofertilizer application. Relative to well-watered conditions (WW), the plant height experienced reductions of 11.8% and 26.9% under moderate water stress (MWS) and severe water stress (SWS), respectively. Furthermore, the introduction of AMF, PGPR, and the combination of AMF + PGPR yielded enhancements in plant height by 17.3%, 11.4%, and 28.9%, respectively, when contrasted against the control group (Fig. 2). Simultaneous co-inoculation with both AMF and PGPR, alongside the well-watered (WW) treatment, exhibited a significant augmentation in the leaf count compared to the control group. The most minimal leaf count was registered within the SWS, wherein no biofertilizers were administered. Notably, leaf count exhibited 11.5% and 31.1% reductions under moderate water stress (MWS) and severe water stress (SWS), respectively. Conversely, the introduction of AMF, PGPR, or the combined application of AMF + PGPR led to increments of 17%, 8.5%, and 23.3%, respectively, in the number of leaves compared to the control group (Fig. 3). The highest dry yield (DY) of 11.53 grams per plant was observed under well-watered (WW) conditions, whereas the lowest DY of 8.71 grams per plant was documented in severe water stress (SWS) conditions. The DY exhibited 10.2% and 24.5% reductions under moderate water stress (MWS) and severe water stress (SWS), respectively. The findings unveiled that the introduction of AMF, PGPR, or the combined application of AMF + PGPR could foster an elevation in DY by 23.7%, 13.5%, and 37.3%, respectively, compared to the control group (Table 1)."

Notably, the EO productivity of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. exhibited an increase of 27.7% and 13.9% in conditions characterized by MWS and SWS, respectively. Furthermore, the concurrent inoculation of AMF and PGPR markedly amplified the EO content of D. kotschyi Boiss. This enhancement was 27.2% compared to situations where biofertilizers were not applied (Table 2). The highest essential oil (EO) yield, measuring 0.13 grams per plant, was achieved under conditions of MWS, while the lowest yield of 0.10 grams per plant was observed in SWS treatments. Additionally, the most substantial EO yield was documented when the co-inoculation of AMF and PGPR was implemented, resulting in a noteworthy increase of 66.7% compared to the control treatment (Table 2). The highest concentrations of chlorophyll a (0.59 mg g−1 fresh weight) and chlorophyll b (0.24 mg g−1 fresh weight) were observed in plants subjected to WW conditions and co-inoculated with both AMF and PGPR. Compared to the well-watered conditions, the chlorophyll a and b contents experienced 12.7% and 13.6% under MWS and reductions of 21.8% and 22.7% under SWS treatments. Remarkably, the co-inoculation of AMF and PGPR yielded a substantial enhancement in chlorophyll a and b content, increasing by 32.5% and 31.2%, respectively (Figs. 4A and 4B). The most elevated carotenoid concentration (2.22 mg g−1 fresh weight) was derived from plants subjected to MWS, closely trailed by those under SWS, with concentrations 15.6% and 9.4% higher than WW conditions, respectively. Moreover, the introduction of AMF, PGPR, and their combined application (AMF + PGPR) all contributed to enhancements in carotenoid concentration, specifically by 4.6%, 2.5%, and 13.6%, respectively (Table 3).

Remarkably, the co-inoculation of AMF and PGPR resulted in the highest RWC value, surpassing the control treatment by 15.5% (Table 3). The simultaneous application of AMF and PGPR and treatment of SWS exhibited a marked increase in total soluble solids (TSS) content. Notably, the TSS content demonstrated an upward trajectory as soil water availability diminished. Compared to treatment WW, the TSS content experienced 32.8% and 68.5% increments under MWS and SWS conditions, respectively. Intriguingly, the inoculation with AMF, PGPR, and the combined application of AMF + PGPR led to enhancements in TSS content by 20.2%, 17.2%, and 38.1%, respectively (Fig. 5). The simultaneous application of AMF and PGPR, coupled with the SWS treatment, yielded the highest proline content (18.5 µmol g−1 fresh weight). The proline content exhibited an ascending trend as soil water availability decreased. Compared to WW conditions, the proline content demonstrated 16.6% and 33.1% increments under MWS and SWS treatments, respectively. Furthermore, the introduction of AMF, PGPR, and the combined application of AMF + PGPR led to enhancements in proline content by 13.1%, 4.7%, and 26.5%, respectively (Fig. 6). Applying GC-MS and GC-FID analysis, 26 compounds were successfully identified within the essential oil (EO) of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. Among these, the predominant constituents were geranyl acetate (11.4–18.88%), alpha-pinene (9.33–15.08%), Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (8.43–12.8%), neral (6.80–9.32%), geranial (9.23–11.91%), and limonene (5.56–9.12%). Remarkably, the highest levels of geranyl acetate, geranial, limonene, and alpha-pinene were observed within the context of MWS, particularly following the co-application of AMF and PGPR. Similarly, the maximum content of Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate and neral was documented under SWS, specifically when the co-inoculation of AMF and PGPR was implemented (Table 4)."
TA041776_D_0001,"The study investigates the effects of co-inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss. under water deficit stress. Results show that water stress reduces yield and relative water content, but AMF and PGPR application mitigates these effects, enhancing growth, chlorophyll content, and essential oil production. The combined AMF + PGPR treatment under well-watered conditions yields the best growth and chlorophyll levels, while mild water stress with AMF + PGPR maximizes essential oil content and yield. Essential oil analysis identifies key compounds like geranyl acetate and alpha-pinene, with their highest concentrations observed under mild stress with AMF + PGPR. The study highlights the role of biofertilizers in improving plant resilience and productivity under drought.","The study’s findings revealed a noticeable decline in yield and associated components because of the water deficit treatments: moderate water stress (MWS) and severe water stress (SWS). In situations of moderate water limitation, the reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption and photosynthesis rate can be attributed to the stomatal closure mechanism, which serves to curtail water transpiration and, subsequently, the production of plant biomass. Under conditions of severe water scarcity, the decrement in plant yield can be attributed to disruptions in chloroplast structure coupled with diminished cell division and elongation. This cascade of effects leads to compromised leaf development and expansion, diminishing light interception and photosynthesis rate. Furthermore, the study’s results align with observations made by, who noted that applying biofertilizers enhanced the growth and dry weight of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. Incorporating biofertilizers was also found to bolster the plant’s resilience against water scarcity, diseases, and pests. The co-application of AMF and PGPR emerges as the most efficacious treatment, yielding the highest agronomic traits and dry yield. The introduction of AMF contributes to enhanced nutrient and water absorption, thereby improving primary plant metabolism and elevating both photosynthesis rate and overall performance. Similarly, the application of PGPR induces a stimulatory effect on plant growth, primarily by augmenting the rate of nitrogen fixation, enhancing nutrient solubility—particularly for phosphorus (P) and potassium(K)—promoting siderophore production, and facilitating the synthesis of enzymes that regulate ethylene production. In another research, it was found that the presence of suitable conditions for the growth of D. moldavica plants, including increasing the availability of necessary nutrients, especially nitrogen, under the influence of co-application AMF with PGPR under water deficit stress, through improving growth, development, and photosynthesis, leads to an improvement in plant height, and leaves number, which ultimately leads to an increase in the yield of dry weight. Inoculated plants also improved stomatal regulation through hormonal adjustment. Production of IAA by symbiotic bacteria may partly explain their effectiveness in promoting plant growth under adverse environmental conditions. It has been reported that the inoculation of biofertilizers enhances growth parameters and aerial dry weight in D. kotschyi Boiss. under water deficit stress. reported that applying biofertilizer improved the biological and grain yields of dragon head plants compared to those not subjected to fertilization under water stress. reported that AMF and PGPR applications improved plant development and production of dragon head plants under water shortage stress states by increasing nutrient accessibility and absorption. The authors attributed such results to the positive effect exerted by the treatments on vegetative growth, chlorophyll synthesis, and photosynthesis capacity, especially under water shortage tension. The beneficial influence of AMF and PGPR may be related to increased soil organic matter content and a regulated availability of nutrients in the agricultural soil, which directly influence dragon head plant photosynthetic and vegetative growth."
TA041776_D_0002,"The study further explores the impact of AMF and PGPR on essential oil (EO) biosynthesis, chlorophyll content, and osmotic regulation under water stress. The combined AMF + PGPR treatment under mild water stress enhances EO production and key compounds like geranyl acetate and alpha-pinene. Chlorophyll content declines under water stress due to reactive oxygen species (ROS), but carotenoids increase as part of the plant's antioxidant response. Relative water content (RWC) decreases with water scarcity but improves with AMF + PGPR due to enhanced hydraulic conductivity. The study also notes the accumulation of proline and total soluble sugars (TSS) under stress, which are critical for osmotic regulation and stress tolerance. These findings underscore the adaptive mechanisms of plants under drought and the role of biofertilizers in mitigating stress effects.","The application of both AMF and PGPR, denoted as treatment MWS, led to an enhancement in essential oil (EO) biosynthesis, EO yield, and the major constituents of the EO, namely geranyl acetate, geranial, limonene, and alpha-pinene. This augmentation in EO production under stressful conditions underscores the plant’s adaptive physiological responses to challenging environments. In situations characterized by water limitation, the photosynthesis rate tends to decrease due to the closure of stomata, which in turn reduces the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2). This leads to the accumulation of NADPH and H+ ions within cells. In response, the biosynthesis of EO compounds is activated as an alternative pathway, specifically through methyleritrophosphate and mevalonic acid pathways, which consume excess NADPH and H+ ions. Similar phenomena have been documented in other plant species; for example, the essential oil yield and major EO compounds of Rosmarinus officinalis L. were reported to be increased under moderate drought stress conditions. The elevation in the biosynthesis of EO constituents resulting from the combined application of AMF and PGPR can be attributed to their role in enhancing nutrient accessibility. This enhancement subsequently facilitates the development of glandular trichomes and the formation of EO intermediate compounds such as ATP and acetyl coenzyme A. reported that applying biological fertilizers improved the oil content and oil yield of the dragon head plants under water shortage stress. Also, such treatments may enhance the extent of essential oil-producing glands in flowers and leaves of the dragon head plant under water shortage stress. In the current investigation, biofertilizers such as AMF and PGPR may have enhanced the nutrient uptake and improved plant moisture relationships compared to control plants, leading to the essential oil and essential oil yield of the dragon head plants increment. Chlorophyll content exhibited a pronounced decline in response to increased water availability, primarily attributable to the occurrence of membrane lipid peroxidation and the decomposition of chlorophyll due to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Observations in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seedlings have similarly indicated reduced chlorophyll a and b content under drought stress conditions. Conversely, the carotenoid content demonstrated enhancement following both MWS and SWS treatments. This phenomenon can be attributed to the operation of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems, which effectively counteract oxidative damage in plant tissues subjected to water limitation. Among the non-enzymatic antioxidants, carotenoids (including xanthophylls and carotenes), along with ascorbates and alpha-tocopherol, play a vital role in bolstering plant tolerance against stress by attenuating the activity of ROS compounds. The increased carotenoid concentration observed in response to water deficit stress conditions reinforces plant defence mechanisms to cope with stress-induced challenges. reported that by enhancing the water shortage stress in the dragon head, chlorophyll a, b, chlorophyll a + b, and carotenoids at flowering stages were decreased; nevertheless, they were improved in response to AMF and PGPR. The degradation of such pigments or the reduction of their synthesis, associated with the reduced activity of enzymes involved in their synthesis, causes chlorophyll decline in dragon head plants exposed to water deficit stress, resulting in reduced assimilation material and, thus, performance losses. The relative water content (RWC) exhibited a reduction concomitant with the diminishing availability of soil water. This decline in RWC in response to water deficit stress conditions arises from an escalation in leaf transpiration rate coupled with a decrease in the rate of water absorption by the roots. Notably, the integrated application of AMF and PGPR contributed to an enhancement in RWC. The mechanism behind this enhancement is closely linked to the penetration of fungal hyphae into the root cortex and endoderm, which augments the hydraulic conductivity of water by establishing a path characterized by low resistance across the root cells. This phenomenon has been noted in prior research, where the inoculation of Dorema moldavica L. roots with AMF enhanced RWC under water deficit stress conditions. reported that the leaf RWC of the dragon head diminishes as water stress increases. The decrease of tissues’ turgor in plant and leaf RWC can be the first effect of water deficit stress, which can have a natural influence on the development, growth, and ultimate size of cells. AMF and PGPR fertilizers enhance water uptake in the host plant by altering root architecture and spreading the plant’s root system. Indeed, biofertilizers can alleviate the negative influences of water deficit stress on dragon head plants by enhancing leaf moisture potential, transpiration rate, photosynthetic efficiency, and rate of CO2 use. Moreover, they can promote the absorption of nutrients, enhancing growth and plant production. In the present study, an augmentation in proline and total soluble solids(TSS) content was observed under drought-stress conditions following the application of AMF and PGPR. These concentrations of TSS substances allow growth in low water conditions. The most important source of TSS substances is photosynthetic compounds, which are either produced directly or from the hydrolysis of carbon reserves. Since both photosynthesis and growth are affected by drought stress, their balance affects the accumulation of TSS substances. Considering that a water shortage affects growth before photosynthesis is affected, the accumulation of photosynthesis products seems obvious. Therefore sucrose acts as a signaling molecule in low concentrations and as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species in high concentrations. Thus the buildup of TSS inside the cells performs a necessary part in the regulation of osmosis and permits the reduction of the water potential of the cell, so more water remains inside the cell to maintain turgor under drought stress. In drought stress conditions, osmotic regulators can escalate the power of water uptake by plant cells. The accumulation of this osmotic regulator can be related to drought resistance. The improved vegetative growth could account for the higher TSS in applying AMF and PGPR-treated plants of dragon heads. The application of AMF and PGPR probably enhanced growth and led to a greater concentration of carbohydrates under drought stress. This elevation in the levels of osmolytes like proline and TSS is recognized as a vital adaptive response of plants to counteract the impact of drought and other stressful circumstances. The accumulation of these compounds during stressful conditions plays a crucial role in preserving leaf cell turgidity, safeguarding cell membranes, preventing protein denaturation, and neutralizing free radicals. The increase in TSS in the application of AMF and PGPR, which affects the osmotic potential, helps to maintain the health and function of the cell membranes of the dragon head that have been damaged by water stress. Reinforcing this observation, it has been documented that the proline content in Lallemantia iberica plants increased notably under moderate and severe drought stress. Additionally, the increased concentration of osmolytes within plant cells under water-limiting conditions serves to lower the osmotic potential, thereby enhancing the plant’s capacity to absorb water from the soil via the roots, consequently boosting its resilience in such situations. Moreover, the enhanced proline content resulting from the integrated application of AMF + PGPR can be attributed to the intertwined relationship between proline concentration in plant cells and nitrogen availability. The accessibility of nutrients, especially nitrogen, is facilitated by the role of these fertilizers. Additionally, it has been reported that the symbiotic association between AMF and plant roots under drought stress conditions promotes an increase in proline content through the upregulation of the glutamate pathway and downregulation of proline degradation. This interplay between plant and AMF has been evident in sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas L.), where AMF inoculation led to increased tolerance to water deficit by elevating proline content and soluble sugars. Dragon head plants inoculated with biofertilizers such as AMF + PGPR can usually manage nutrients and water more suitably than non-treated crops under moisture shortage stress situations. Therefore, the proline content, such as dragon head plants, indicates a lower upsurge compared to non-treated plants."

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Because of swift climate change, drought is a primary environmental factor that substantially diminishes plant productivity. Furthermore, the increased use of chemical fertilizers has given rise to numerous environmental problems and health risks. Presently, there is a transition towards biofertilizers to enhance crops' yield, encompassing medicinal and aromatic varieties.

Regarding essential oil production, the maximum content (1.29%) and yield (0.13 g plant (-1)) were obtained from mild water stress (MWS) treatment. The co-application of AMF and PGPR resulted in the highest essential oil content and yield (1.31% and 0.15 g plant(-1), respectively). The analysis of D. kotschyi Boiss. essential oil identified twenty-six compounds, with major constituents including geranyl acetate (11.4-18.88%), alpha-pinene (9.33-15.08%), Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (8.43-12.8%), neral (6.80-9.32%), geranial (9.23-11.91%), and limonene (5.56-9.12%). Notably, the highest content of geranyl acetate, geranial, limonene, and alpha-pinene was observed in plants subjected to MWS treatment following AMF + PGPR application. Furthermore, the co-application of AMF, PGPR, and severe water stress (SWS) notably increased the total soluble sugar (TSS) and proline content. In conclusion, the results indicate that the combined application of AMF and PGPR can effectively enhance the quantity and quality of essential oil in D. kotschyi Boiss., particularly when the plants are exposed to water deficit stress conditions."
TA041776_C_0002,"The discussion emphasizes the synergistic effects of AMF and PGPR in mitigating water stress impacts on D. kotschyi Boiss., improving essential oil yield and quality. It calls for further research on specific strains and molecular mechanisms to optimize these benefits for sustainable agriculture.","Discussion: The study reveals the detrimental impact of water stress on the agronomic traits and dry matter yield of Dorema kotschyi Boiss. plant. However, in the face of water stress conditions, the concurrent application of AMF and PGPR emerges as a strategy that effectively mitigates these adverse effects. This integrated approach showcases its potential to enhance various parameters, including chlorophylls, carotenoids, proline, and total soluble sugars. Furthermore, the co-application of AMF + PGPR positively influences the dry matter yield and essential oil yield of D. kotschyi Boiss. plants, marking a significant achievement in pursuit of the primary cultivation goal. The synergistic effect of AMF and PGPR is observed in the elevation of essential oil content and the pivotal compounds within the essential oil, notably geranyl acetate, geranial, limonene, and alpha-pinene. This promising outcome holds substantial implications for enhancing grain and essential oil yields while concurrently addressing environmental concerns linked to the excessive usage of chemical fertilizers. Moreover, the cultivation of D. kotschyi Boiss., known for its low water requirements, presents an avenue for prudent water management and increased plant tolerance. In light of these findings, the co-application of AMF and PGPR in water stress conditions emerges as a viable strategy to achieve the dual objectives of augmenting plant productivity and essential oil yield while concurrently advancing sustainable agriculture principles. In contrast to earlier investigations into Dracocephalum kotschyi, this study has made a substantial contribution to our comprehension of how the combined application of AMF and PGPR can improve the plant’s growth and biochemical characteristics when subjected to water scarcity. Notably, this study has shed light on the mechanisms behind the observed improvements. The choice of AMF and PGPR species does matter, as the co-application of certain strains yielded the most promising results. However, there is a need for further exploration and identification of the most effective strains for Dracocephalum kotschyi. The next step in this research area should involve a more comprehensive investigation into the specific AMF and PGPR strains that can maximize the plant’s resilience to water scarcity. Additionally, understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying the observed improvements in growth and biochemical attributes would be valuable. This knowledge gap presents an exciting opportunity for future research, which could lead to the development of tailored strategies for enhancing the growth of Dracocephalum kotschyi under water deficit conditions. Furthermore, while this study has shown improvements in yield, essential oil production, and physiological responses, more extensive field trials and long-term assessments are necessary to confirm the practical applicability of these findings in real-world agricultural settings."
TA038173_I_0001,"Orange fruits are widely consumed and processed, with pulps used for juice and peels for essential oils, and their aroma compounds have been extensively studied, revealing major classes like terpenes, alcohols, and aldehydes.","Orange fruits are the most popular ones for consumers throughout the world due to their pleasant flavors and nutritional value. The fruits are both consumed fresh and industrially processed. The pulps, which are rich in soluble sugars, significant amounts of vitamin C, pectin, fiber and different organic acids, are mainly used to process into juice. Orange peels containing abundant fragrant substances are extensively applied for processing into essential oils which are used commercially for flavoring foods, beverages, perfumes, cosmetics, etc. Analytical research on the aroma compounds in orange fruit has been carried out for many years. Many researchers have studied the volatile compounds of this fruit using different analytical methods. As a result of these studies, more than 200 components have been described as components of the flavor of sweet orange, and the major aroma compounds found in orange juice are hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and ketones. The presences of terpenes with traces of oxygenated components are the aromatic character in the orange essential oil and peel oil."
TA038173_I_0002,"GC-O is a key method for identifying aroma-active compounds in food, with techniques like dilution analysis and SPME being used to study orange juice and peel oil, though challenges remain in quantifying volatiles and applying dilution methods.","Only a small part of all volatiles present in food has a primary impact on aroma. The aromatic quality of the fruit is primarily dependent on the aroma active compounds. Gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) analysis is a valuable method for the detection of aroma active compounds from a food matrix. The three main GC-O methods are the dilution analysis, detection frequency and perceived intensity method, and these techniques have been employed by various researchers to determine the aroma impacting compounds in orange juice. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is a rapid, solvent-free, low-cost, simple extracting method, and usually combined with GC-O analysis. The amounts of flavor compounds absorbed on the SPME coating were greatly influenced by the diffusion of flavor components through orange juice into the headspace and the headspace gas reach to the SPME coating. Therefore, the high correlations between the concentrations and GC peak area were not obtained for all the volatile compounds. It is also difficult to perform the dilution analysis such as AEDA using SPME extracts. Kim et al. varied the GC injector split ratio to achieve dilution stepwise of the flavor compounds in HS-SPME–GC-O using an aqueous model system and yuzu tea. The research only demonstrated that serial dilution of the four flavor compounds in yuzu can be achieved successful through the increase of GC split ratio, other aroma compounds was not be mentioned. Some researchers conducted the intensity method or frequency method combined with SPME to analysis orange juice flavor. Bazeome et al. stated that ethyl butanoate, mycrene, trans-2-nonenal, decanal, octanal, terpinen-4-ol, cis-hex-3-enal and three unkown compounds were aroma active compounds in unpasteurized juice and heated juice, using SPME extraction and intensity method. Arena et al. used frequency detection method and SPME to find twenty-two odor active compounds in hand-squeezed juices of Moro, Tarocco, Washington navel and Valencia late oranges."
TA038173_I_0003,"GC-O has been applied to characterize aroma-active compounds in citrus essential oils, identifying key terpenoids, but Jinchen sweet orange, an economically important variety, lacks prior aroma research.","GC–O procedure has also been conducted to characterize the aroma active components in some citrus essential oils. Lin and Rouseff detected 38 aroma-active compounds in commercial cold-pressed grapefruit oil using a time–intensity GC-O procedure and concluded that the greatest aroma intensity compounds were1, 8-cineole, octanal, dodecanal, trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal, β-sinensal and nootkatone. Högnadóttir and Rouseff found 55 aroma active compounds of the detected 95 volatile compounds in orange essence oil. The flavor compounds in orange peel oil extracted by SPME have never been reported. Jinchen is a native sweet crop of Citrus Sinensis. It originated from the Sichuan province and has been widely planted in the middle and upper regions of the Yangtze River. No research on Jinchen aroma has ever been reported, though Jinchen is of economic importance to the citrus industry in China. The aim of the study was to determine the aroma active compounds in Jinchen orange fruit juice and peel oil by GC-MS and GC-O, as well as to provide useful information about the most important potent odorants in this fruit."
TA038173_M_0001,"The study utilized GC-MS and GC-O to analyze the aromatic composition and active compounds in Jinchen sweet orange fruit juice and peel oil. SPME with a specific fiber was used for volatile compound extraction from the samples. The samples were prepared and stored under controlled conditions, and the extraction process involved equilibration and headspace extraction. Authentic standards and reference compounds were used for identification and confirmation.","Unpasteurized Jinchen orange fruit juice and peel oil were obtained from a local manufacturer of citrus products located at Songzi in Hubei province. Both the juice and the peel oil were derived from the same fruit source. The fruit juice was processed with a Polycitrus juice extractor. The peel oil was obtained from cold-pressed peel of the Jinchen orange fruit. The juice and oil samples were stored at ‑20 °C until analyzed. The manual SPME device equipped with a 50/30 μm DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber (Supelco, Bellfonte, PA, USA) was used for extraction volatile compounds of fruit juice. The fiber was conditioned in the GC injector port at 270 °C for 1 h prior to use. The orange juice (5 mL) and peel oil (5 mL) were placed into a 20 mL vial containing a micro stirring bar, respectively. The sample was equilibrated at 40 °C±1 °C for 15 min and headspace extracted by DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber for 40 min at the same temperature under stirring (500 rpm). After extraction, the fiber was inserted into the injection port of the GC to desorb the analytes for 5 min. Each analytical sample was measured in triplicate. The results are reported as the mean values of relative peak area percent ± SD (standard deviation). Authentic standards were obtained as follows: α-pinene were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Germany) n-alkanes (C8-C20), ethyl butyrate, β-myrcene, linalool, decanal, were obtained from FluKa Chemical Co. (Germany). Hexanal, trans-2-hexenal, benzaldehyde, octanal, limonene, nonanal, α-terpineol, neral, geranial, neryl acetate, geranyl acetate, citronellyl acetate and valencene were gifts from the GLD-Boton Essential Company (P.

TA038173_M_0002,"GC-MS and GC-O analyses were performed using specific equipment and conditions. The GC-MS setup included a quadrupole mass selective detector with specific ionization settings and a column with a detailed temperature program. Volatile components were identified by comparing mass spectra with libraries and confirmed using retention indices and standards. GC-O involved a sniffing port for odor detection, with the same column and temperature program as GC-MS. Panelists were trained to describe and rate odor intensities, and statistical analysis was applied to evaluate the results.","GC-MS was carried out using a HP 5975B quadropole mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, USA). The Mass spectral ionization temperature was set at 230 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact ionization mode at a voltage of 70 eV. Mass spectra were taken over the m/z range 30–400. The flow rate of the helium carrier gas on HP-5 column (30 m×0.25 mmI.D, 0.25 μm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) was 1 mL/min. The analysis performed in the splitless mode and injector temperature was 250 °C. The column was held at 40 °C for 3 min, and then increased from 40 °C to 160 °C at 3 °C/min, held at 160 °C for 2 min, and finally increased to 220 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, then held for 3 min. Volatile components were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the mass spectra from MS libraries (NIST 05, WILEY 7.0). When available, MS identifications were confirmed by comparing GC retention times of the analytes with those from pure standards. The identification was confirmed using retention indices (RI), and the value was compared with those reported in the literature. Linear retention indices (RI) of the compounds were calculated using a series of n-alkanes (C8–C20, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) injected in the same conditions. When standard chemicals were not available, tentative identification was carried out by matching the mass spectra. The results are given in Table 1. The analysis was carried out using a HP 6890 GC equipped with a HP-5 column (30 m×0.25 mm I.D, 0.25 μm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) directly connected to a HP 5975 series mass selective detector and a sniffing port (ODP2, Gerstel,Inc., Baltimore, MD). The GC effluent was split 1/2 between the mass spectrometer and the sniffing port. The transfer line to the GC-O sniffing port was held at 280 °C. The volume of sample extract analyzed and oven program temperatures were the same as those described above for the GC-MS. Humidified air was added in the sniffing port at 60 mL/min. Compound identifications were made by comparison of the mass spectra, retention times, and the RI of the volatile components in both extracts with those of corresponding reference standards. The mass spectrometer retention times were compared with the retention times measured in the olfactometry runs, and both were compared to reference standards. Three panelists were used for the intensity detection and verbal description of the odor active components identified in both extracts by GC-O. The first training was familiarization with the scale and the system in a short period. During this period the panelists performed three times analysis of one of the test samples and rate intensity of the eluted odor using the four scale (1=extremely weak, 2=clear but not intense odor, 3=intense odor, 4=extremely strong). They were not instructed about what was the expected intensity of the odors and each one used the intensity category, which in his / her opinion fitted best the intensity of the odor perception caused by the eluted odorant. Test data were recorded only after panelists demonstrated an ability to replicate analyses and the scales given by each panelist were not significant difference. After the successful test, the trained panelists carried out sniffing the samples and recorded the perceived intensities of the odor. The results of intensity from two samples were statistically evaluated by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistically, differences with P-values under 0.05 were considered significant."
TA038173_R_0001,"The study used GC-MS and GC-O to analyze the aromatic composition of Jinchen sweet orange fruit juice and peel oil. A total of 49 compounds were identified in the juice and 32 in the peel oil, with 41 components contributing to the aroma. Key aroma-active compounds included ethyl butanoate, beta-myrcene, octanal, linalool, alpha-pinene, and decanal.

Thesedifferences lead to the different overall aroma between fruit juice and peel oil."
TA038173_R_0002,"The volatile components in Jinchen fruit juice and peel oil were analyzed, revealing distinct compositional differences. The juice contained 49 compounds, including hydrocarbons, aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and a ketone, with limonene being the most abundant. The peel oil had 32 compounds, predominantly terpenes like limonene (90.85%). Unique compounds were found in each sample, such as sesquiterpenes in the juice and citronellal in the peel oil. Esters and alcohols were more prevalent in the juice, while aldehydes like octanal and decanal were key in both samples. GC-O analysis identified 31 aroma-active components in the juice and 22 in the peel oil, with some compounds like valencene showing higher intensity in the juice.","In the analysis of volatile components present in Jinchen fruit juice, a total of 49 compounds were identified including 20 hydrocarbons, 10 aldehydes, nine esters, nine alcohols, and one ketone (Table 1). Limonene, followed by linalool, terpinen-4-ol, β-myrcene, α-terpineol, octanal, and γ-terpinene were the components found in greatest proportions.In peel oil extracts, a total of 32 compounds were identified in the volatile fraction, including 16 hydrocarbons and eight aldehydes, three esters, three alcohols, one ketone and one terpenic oxide(Table 1). Among these components, limonene was the one found in greatest concentrations, representing 90.85% of all volatiles. Other predominant components were β-myrcene, γ-terpinene, linalool and α-pinene.In both samples the major compounds were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The peel oil contained terpenes at higher levels than those of the fruit juice, except for cis-β-ocimene, β-myrcene, terpinolene, δ-amorphene and valencene. Three sesquiterpenes which could not be found in peel oil were detected in small quantity in fruit juice: α-cubebene, β-elemene, and α-caryophyllene. Bicyclogermacrene, which had been reported in lime oils by Tu et al. and Ferhat et al. was found in Jinchen peel oil in minor amounts (0.01%), but was not found in Jinchen fruit juice.It is interesting to note the large difference between the numbers of alcohols and esters found in the fruit juice and peel oil. Six alcohols only found in the fruit juice were 1-octanol, β-terpineol, terpinen-4-ol, nerol, trans-carveol, and geraniol. These have been mentioned as important compounds associated to the pulp in the juice. Another possible reason for their presence is that the alcohols are reaction products generated during the processing or storage of the orange juice. Terpinen-4-ol is the degradation product of D-limonene and linalool during the heat treatment of juice and its concentration significantly increased during the storage of the heat-treated juices.Esters have been described to be most important to orange flavor. Ethyl butanoate followed by ethyl acetate, ethyl propanoate, and methyl butanoate, only present in fruit juice, were not detected in peel oil. These lower boiling points and high volatility esters could have higher degree of affinity in the pulp. Aldehyde content, especially of octanal and decanal, is generally considered one of the standards for characterization for orange peel oil,. These compounds were the most predominant among the aldehyde compounds in both samples, occurring in higher proportions in fruit juice than in peel oil. In addition, other aliphatic aldehydes play an important role in orange flavor. Nonanal, and dodecanal were only present in peel oil, whereas hexanal, trans-2-hexenal, heptanal, undecanal were only detected in fruit juice. A terpenic aldehyde only present in the peel oil was citronellal, constituting 0.06% of all volatile compounds, which has been reported in many citrus oils. The aldehydes are most likely enzymatic degradation products of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.With respect to the rest of the identified components, nootkatone was found in both fruit juice and peel oil. It is a typical component of grapefruits, and its content in the fruits increases with maturation and storage. One terpenic oxide compound (trans-limonene oxide) was identified only in the peel oil of Jinchen fruit. It is possible that the limonene oxidation during the process and storage may be responsible for the formation of this compound in peel oil.It was cosidered very necessary to determine the components responsible for the quality of the aroma of Jinchen fruit, therefore, GC-O was performed for further studying the aromatic profile of Jinchen fruit juice and peel oil.The odor descriptors for all volatile components perceived by panelists in fruit juice and peel oil extracts of Jinchen fruit are shown in Table 2. As a result of the different odor thresholds of each component, not all of the compounds quantified contribute to the aroma in the juice and peel oil. However, olfactometric analysis utilizes the highly selective detector (human nose) that can detect potent low-level aroma-active compounds which could not be quantified by GC-MS (trans-2-hexen-1-ol, ethyl 3-hydroxyhexanoate, and six unknown compounds).A total of 31 components appeared to contribute to the aromatic profile in Jinchen fruit juice. Among them, ethyl butanoate, β-myrcene, octanal, linalool, and decanal decided the juice aroma because they are the strongest aroma active compounds perceived by all the panelists. Regarding the peel oil, 22 components appeared to contribute to the overall aroma. Linalool, α-pinene, and decanal defined the aroma of the oil, because these compounds had the greatest aroma intensity. Twelve compounds were perceived by all the panelists in both juice and oil. Among them, five aromatic compounds present different odor intensity in both samples, such as α-pinene, β-myrcene, octanal, (trans, trans)-2,4-decadienal, and valencene. The intensity of octanal, trans, trans-2, 4- decadienal, and valencene showed the significant difference (P<0.05) between the fruit juice and peel oil. Especially, valencene exhibited higher intensity in Jinchen fruit juice than in the peel oil, though valencene was not generally considered an important contributor to orange juice flavor in previously reports."

Nineteen components were exclusive to the juice, imparting citrusy, green, and piney notes, while ten compounds unique to the peel oil contributed camphor, minty, green, fruity, and floral aromas. Notably, limonene, despite its high concentration, was not the strongest aroma contributor. Some compounds like ethyl 3-hydroxyhexanoate and nerol, though low in concentration, significantly influenced the juice's aroma. The study also highlighted unique compounds in Jinchen juice and peel oil not commonly reported in other citrus varieties.","The different overall aroma between fruit juice and peel oil are attributed to the various composition of aroma active compounds.

Zika virus is mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and usually causes a mild dengue-like illness that may include fever, cutaneous rash, malaise, headache, muscle and joint pain, and/or swollen lymph nodes. Neurological complications include Guillain–Barré syndrome and congenital malformations leading to microcephaly. Although Zika virus outbreaks have declined after 2017, autochthonous transmission of ZIKV still occurs globally across at least 87 countries and territories, with the potential for re-emergence. Since specific antiviral drugs or vaccines are not available, there is urgency in identifying antiviral agents, particularly new molecular scaffolds with potential novel mechanisms of actions. Natural products have played a dominant role in the drug discovery efforts for the treatment of human diseases. In fact, in 2015, small molecules accounted for 45 drugs as antivirals other than synthetic molecules or 70% overall based on natural products, indicating the potential of identifying new therapeutic candidates from natural sources."
TA046933_I_0002,"The introduction describes the biological sources and activities of abietane diterpenoids, focusing on dehydroabietic acid and ferruginol, and their potential as antiviral agents against flaviviruses like dengue and Zika virus, based on previous findings and structural similarities.","The abietane diterpenoids are widely produced by conifers and plants belonging to the families Araucariaceae, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae, and angiosperm species. These natural products have a wide range of biological activities. For example, dehydroabietic acid (1, DHA) (Figure 1), displays not only antiulcer and antimicrobial properties, but also antitumor effects. Ferruginol (2) (Figure 1) was first isolated in 1939 and has been extensively studied because of intriguing chemical framework and promising biological properties. Ferruginol (2) occurs in plants belonging to the Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Lamiaceae and Verbenaceae families among others. This diterpene exhibited important bioactivities, such as antifungal and antimicrobial, miticidal, cardioactive, antioxidative, antileishmanial and nematicidal, antiulcer, and anti-SARS properties. In addition, there are several reports on antimalarial activity of ferruginol (2). Recently, it has been reported that several antimalarials are endowed with anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV activities. We have also found that some analogues derived from (+)-dehydroabietylamine (3) (Figure 1) of the naturally occurring abietane ferruginol (2) (Figure 1) were active against DENV-2. The 12-hydroxyabieta-8,11,13-triene skeleton, which is characteristic of the diterpenoid ferruginol (2), is therefore an interesting molecular scaffold for the development of novel antivirals against flaviviruses."

Vero cells suspensions (2.7 × 105 cells/mL) prepared in MEM (Minimal Essential Medium, Vitrocell) with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco, Sao Paulo, Brazil) were distributed in 96-well plates (100 μL/well) and incubated at 37 °C (5% CO2) for 24 h. Then, the culture medium was replaced by 200 μL of two-fold serial dilutions of the compounds or DMSO. Cellular controls were treated with the culture medium only. After treatments, plates were further incubated at 37 °C for 4 days. Subsequently, 15 μL of the MTT solution (5 mg/mL) were added per well, and the plates were incubated again for 4 h. The MTT solution was removed and 100 μL of DMSO were added to dissolve formazan crystals. Finally, the plates were shaken and absorbance was read at 540 nm. The viability percentage data for each tested concentration of the compounds were entered in the GraphPad Prism software (version 5.01, San Diego, California, USA) to calculate the CC50 values, the concentration of compound that causes a 50% reduction in cell viability, through regression analysis. Zika virus (clinical isolate, IMT17) stock was produced and titrated in Vero cells. The viral titer, 4.67 × 106 plaque forming units per milliliter (PFU/mL), was determined by plaque assay. The potential anti-ZIKV activity was evaluated by viral plaque reduction assay. Briefly, Vero cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were grown in 24-well plates for 24 h. After that, cells were infected with 100 PFU/well and incubated for 1 h in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were then washed with PBS (pH 7.0) and treated with different concentrations of each compound [diluted in 2 X MEM with 2% FBS and 50% high viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, Sigma)]. Ribavirin was used as the positive control. Medium only and DMSO were used as untreated and solvent controls, respectively. After 4 days of incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, supernatants were removed, and cells were fixed and stained with 50% crystal violet in 50% ethanol. Plaque numbers were used to calculate the inhibition percentage values in order to determine the EC50, the concentration of the compound that inhibits viral replication by 50%, through non-linear regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism. Compounds efficacy was determined by the selectivity index (SI = CC50 / EC50), the ratio between cytotoxicity and antiviral activity."

Among these bioactive compounds, sesquiterpenes (including drimane sesquiterpenes, phenolic bisabolane sesquiterpenes, eremophilane sesquiterpenes, cyclonerodiol sesquiterpenes, and so on) are produced by some marine-derived fungal species mainly from the genera Aspergillus, Trichothecium, Graphostroma, and Trichoderma. These compounds display a diverse array of biological activities, including cytotoxic, antibacterial, nitric oxide inhibitory, nematicidal, anti-inflammatory, and growth inhibition of marine phytoplankton activities, which continues to stimulate efforts to discover new sesquiterpenes from nature. Drimane sesquiterpenes, as an important family of sesquiterpenes, showed potent cytotoxic activities against a wide cell variety, including HL-60, SMMC-721, A-549, ACHN, HCT-15, MDA-MB-231, NCI-H23, NUGC-3, and PC-3 cells.In our continuing efforts to identify new bioactive secondary metabolites from marine-derived fungi Aspergillus spp., bioactive investigations on the extract of the fungal strain Aspergillus flavus CF13-11 showed significant cytotoxic activity. Marine-derived Aspergillus flavus is well known for its production of mutagenic mycotoxins and other bioactive compounds (meroterpenoids, indole-diterpenoids, and so on). Our chemical investigations of the fungus CF13-11 using a bioassay-guided method led to the isolation of four toxic C-6/C-7 epimeric drimane sesquiterpene esters, asperienes A–D (1–4) (Figure 1), whose structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and supported by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and Snatzke’s analysis. Herein, we report the isolation, structural elucidation and bioactivities of these compounds."
TA048121_M_0001,"The study began with the isolation and identification of the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus flavus CF13-11 from sediment collected in the Bohai Sea. The fungus was identified using 16S rRNA amplification and ITS region sequencing. Fermentation was conducted using solid culture medium (rice and water) in Erlenmeyer flasks at 28°C for 25 days. The fermented medium was extracted with methanol, and the crude extract was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The ethyl acetate extract was subjected to vacuum silica gel column chromatography with a gradient system of dichloromethane and methanol, yielding seven fractions. Fraction F.3 was further separated using silica gel column chromatography with a petroleum ether and ethyl acetate gradient system, resulting in three subfractions. Subfraction F.3.2 was purified using ODS silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and semi-preparative HPLC to obtain a mixture of compounds 1–4. The epimeric mixture was finally separated using semi-preparative HPLC on a chiral column with n-hexane and ethanol.","The fungus CF13-11 was isolated from marine sediment collected from the Bohai Sea in July 2015. This strain, which was identified as Aspergillus flavus according to its 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing of the ITS region (Genbank, KY979507), was deposited in College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hebei University, China. The fermentation (thirty 1-L Erlenmeyer flasks) of the fungus A. flavus CF13-11 was carried out using solid culture (100 g rice and 100 mL water in each Erlenmeyer flask) at 28 °C for 25 days. The fermented medium was extracted with MeOH six times to obtain the crude extract (28.0 g). The crude extract was then partitioned between EtOAc and H2O to give the EtOAc extract (13.0 g), which was subjected to vacuum silica gel column chromatography with a CH2Cl2/MeOH (100:0, 80:1, 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, and 1:1) gradient system to offer seven fractions (F.1–F.7).

TA048121_R_0002,"Asperiene A (1) was identified as a yellow oil with the molecular formula C23H32O7, featuring a drimane-type sesquiterpene structure with a lactone ring and an additional (2′E,4′E)-5′-carboxypenta-2′,4′-dienoyl side chain. NMR and HR-ESI-MS analyses confirmed its planar structure, while NOESY experiments and Snatzke's method elucidated its relative and absolute configurations (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R). Compounds 1-4 share the same molecular formula but differ in stereochemistry at C-6' and C-7', with 1 and 2 having an erythro configuration and 3 and 4 a threo configuration. ECD calculations validated the assigned configurations, and cytotoxic assays revealed their potent activity against tumor cell lines, with compound 1 being the most active.","Asperiene A (1) (Figure 1) was isolated as a yellow oil with the molecular formula C23H32O7 (eight degrees of unsaturation) by its HR-ESI-MS spectrum. The signals in the 1D spectra of 1 (Table 1 and Table 2, Figures S1 and S2) indicated the presence of two ester carbonyl groups (δC 174.4 C, and 165.4 C), two disubstituted double bonds (δH 7.24 dd, 6.47 dt, 6.33 m, and 5.95 d; δC 145.3 CH, 145.3 CH, 127.3 CH, and 119.8 CH), and one trisubstituted double bond (δH 5.80 s, δC 136.6 C, and 121.4 CH) in 1. These functional groups occupied five of eight degrees of unsaturation in 1, suggesting a tricyclic framework for it. Moreover, three methyl signals with a singlet (δH 1.07 s, 1.07 s, and 0.93 s; 32.1 CH3, 24.3 CH3, and 18.3 CH3) were also observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1. The above characteristic NMR data revealed that 1 should be a drimane-type sesquiterpene with a lactone ring. Comparison of the NMR data of 1 with those of strobilactone B from the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus ustus suggested that 1 shares a similar nucleus structure with the known compound strobilactone B. The main difference between them was the presence of the additional side-chain signals for (2′E,4′E)-5′-carboxypenta-2′,4′-dienoyl moiety (δH 7.24 (1H, dd, J = 15.6, 3.6 Hz, H-3′), 6.47 (1H, dt, J = 15.6, 3.6 Hz, H-4′), 6.33 (1H, m, H-5′), 3.98 (1H, brs, H-6′), 3.57 (1H, t, J = 6.0 Hz, H-7′), and 0.96 (3H, d, J = 6.0 Hz, H-8′); δC 165.4, 145.3, 145.3, 127.3, 119.8, 74.4, 69.3, and 18.2; 1H–1H COSY cross-peaks of H-2′/H-3′/H-4′/H-5′/H-6′/H-7′/H-8′ (Figure 2)) in 1. The HMBC correlations from H-6 proton (δH 5.59) to the C-1′ ester carbonyl demonstrated that the side chain moiety was attached at C-6. Thus, the planar structure for 1 was identified, which was confirmed by a detailed analysis of the HSQC, 1H–1H COSY, and HMBC spectra (Figure 2 and Figures S3–S5) of 1.All of the compounds asperienes A–D (1–4) were obtained with the same molecular formula C23H32O7, and the almost identical 1D and 2D NMR data (Table 1 and Table 2, Figures S1–S27), suggesting that all of 1–4 may be epimers. Upon carefully comparing the 13C NMR spectra of 1–4 (Table 2), the signals, attributable to C-6′, C-7′, and C-8′ in the side chains were found to be different, indicating that 1–4 were stereoisomers differing in the configurations of C-6′ and C-7′.The relative configurations of the sesquiterpenoidal nucleus of 1–4 were determined by their NOESY experiments (Figures S6, S13, S20 and S27), all of which showed NOE correlations from H-15 to H-14, from H-5/H-6 to H-13, and from 9-OH to H-5. The relative configurations of C-6′ and C-7′ in the side chain of 1–4 were assigned by NMR data analysis. The NMR data of the side chain for 1 and 2 ((δC 18.2 (C-8′), δH 3.98 (H-6′), and δH 3.57 (H-7′) for 1; (δC 18.2 (C-8′), δH 3.96 (H-6′), and δH 3.57 (H-7′) for 2) were indicative of an erythro configuration (6′R,7′R or 6′S,7′S) at C-6′ and C-7′ for 1 and 2, according to the literature. Whereas, those of 3 and 4 [(δC 19.2 (C-8′), δH 3.87 (H-6′), and δH 3.49 (H-7′) for 3; (δC 19.3 (C-8′), δH 3.84 (H-6′), and δH 3.48 (H-7′) for 4] hinted at presence of a threo configuration (6′S,7′R or 6′R,7′S) at C-6′ and C-7′ for 3 and 4.In order to assign the absolute configurations of C-6′ and C-7′ in 1–4, induced circular dichroism (ICD) procedure (Snatzke’s method) was carried out for them. The Mo-complexes of 1 (0.5 mg) and dimolybdenum tetraacetate (Mo2(OAc)4) were prepared and used to obtain its ICD spectrum. According to the ICD spectra of the reference Mo-complexes, the negative Cotton effect bands II (near 400 nm) and IV (around 293 nm) in the ICD spectrum of Mo-complexes of 1 (Figure 3) suggested the 6′R,7′R absolute configuration of 1. Accordingly, the absolute configurations of 6′S,7′S, 6′S,7′R, and 6′R,7′S were assigned to compounds 2, 3, and 4, respectively, by the same procedure (Figure 3). Then, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) method was used to assign the absolute configuration of the sesquiterpenoidal nucleus for 1–4. The possible structure (based on the relative configurations of the sesquiterpenoidal nucleus) (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 for 1 was used for ECD quantum chemical calculation and comparison of experimental ECD spectrum of 1. ECD calculations for all of the stable conformers of (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 (Table S1) were performed at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-311+G(d) level in the gas phase by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). ECD simulation for (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 was calculated by Boltzmann statistics (σ 0.25 eV). It was shown that the calculated ECD spectrum of (5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R)-1 matched well with the experimental ECD spectrum of 1 (Figure 4), indicating that the absolute configuration of 1 could be defined as 5S,6R,9S,10S,6′R,7′R. The absolute configurations of the sesquiterpenoidal nucleus in 2–4 could also be assigned as 5S,6R,9S,10S, due to the fact that the ECD spectra of 2–4 were in close and good agreement with that of 1 (Figure 4).In previous literature, drimane sesquiterpene derivatives were reported to possess potent cytotoxic activities toward multiple tumor cell lines. Therefore, the cytotoxic activities of 1–4 to four tumor cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7, MGC-803, and A549) were tested. All of the asperienes A–D (1–4) showed significant cytotoxic activities against these four cell lines (IC50, 1.4–8.3 μM) (Figure 5). Among them, compound 1 exhibited the strongest activity to MCF-7 cells with the IC50 value of 1.4 μM. Interestingly, the toxicities for 1–4 toward GES-1 cells were also examined, with the different IC50 values of 78, 6.2, 4.9, and 83 μM, respectively (Tables S2 and S3)."

TA048121_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the structural variability and separation challenges of drimane sesquiterpene derivatives, which often contain stereogenic carbons leading to epimers. The study successfully separated epimers 1–4 using HPLC on a Chiralpak IC column with n-hexane/EtOH (78:22). Snatzke’s method was employed to determine their absolute configurations. Aspergillus flavus is known for producing carcinogenic mycotoxins like aflatoxins, but this research focused on minor, less-studied mycotoxins with potential bioactivities. The findings suggest that the C-6′ configuration influences toxicity, with compounds 1 and 4 showing promise as antitumor agents due to their higher activity and lower toxicity compared to compounds 2 and 3, which are minor mycotoxins.","Discussion: Drimane sesquiterpene derivatives are a structurally variable family of natural terpenoids mainly obtained from fungi and plants. However, many derivatives of these drimane sesquiterpenoids were esterified at C-6 with fatty acyl moieties, which possibly contained more than one stereogenic carbon. These stereogenic carbons in the side chains of the drimane sesquiterpenoids resulted in the presence of many epimers, which were difficult to separate from each other due to their close polarity. Further, it was difficult to determine the absolute configurations of these stereogenic carbons due to the high conformational flexibility of the chains in them. In fact, two of four sesquiterpenoidal epimers (1–4) have been previously obtained from an algicolous Aspergillus ustus as inseparable epimeric mixtures, whose absolute configurations were also not assigned. In the course of our study, the epimers 1–4 were firstly obtained as a mixture with a ratio of 1:1:1:1. In order to separate these two pair of epimers, HPLC separation was tried on Daicel Chiralpak IA, IB, IC, ID, OB, and OD columns with different mobile phases, including various combinations of n-hexane/IPA or n-hexane/EtOH solvents. Fortunately, 1–4 were separated successfully from each other by using n-hexane/EtOH (78:22) on Chiralpak IC column. Further, in the present research, Snatzke’s method was used as a powerful chemical approach for the configurational investigation of these four sesquiterpenoidal epimers (1–4). Aspergillus flavus is well known as a saprotrophic fungus that infects and contaminates preharvest and postharvest seed crops, such as corn (maize), rice, and peanut (groundnuts). A. flavus infections are notorious for carcinogenic and mutagenic mycotoxin production, which causes enormous agricultural economic loss and poses significant risk to both humans and domestic animals. Among these mycotoxins, the aflatoxins produced by A. flavus have been extensively studied and proven to be major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma or aspergillosis in Southeast Asia and Africa. However, the fungus A. flavus also could generate the other structurally versatile mycotoxins because it consists of a large number of biosynthetic gene clusters. These diversified mycotoxins from the fungus A. flavus, which are minor components but have certain toxicities, may not have been specifically surveyed and may have potent biological activities. Thus, the purpose of this research was to isolate and characterize new toxic natural products with potent bioactivities from the marine-derived fungal strain A. flavus CF13-11 to shed much light on a better understanding of the mycotoxins produced by A. flavus. The results suggested that the configuration at C-6′ in 1–4 may play an important role for the toxicity. The results also indicated that compounds 1 and 4 with higher activities and lower toxicities might have more potential for the development of an antitumor agent, but compounds 2 and 3 were the minor mycotoxins produced by A. flavus."

Among these fungi, the strain Aspergillus flavus is notorious for its mutagenic mycotoxins production. However, some minor components with certain toxicities from A. flavus have not been specifically surveyed and might have potent biological activities. Our investigation of the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus flavus CF13-11 cultured in solid medium led to the isolation of four C-6'/C-7' epimeric drimane sesquiterpene esters, asperienes A-D (1-4). Their absolute configurations were assigned by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and Snatzke's methods. This is the first time that two pairs of C-6'/C-7' epimeric drimane sesquiterpene esters have successfully been separated. Asperienes A-D (1-4) displayed potent bioactivities towards four cell lines with the IC50 values ranging from 1.4 to 8.3 μM. Interestingly, compounds 1 and 4 exhibited lower toxicities than 2 and 3 toward normal GES-1 cells, indicating more potential for development as an antitumor agent in the future."

TA042027_I_0001,"The study addresses the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen (APAP), a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug, which can cause acute liver failure (ALF) due to overdose, mediated by cytochrome P450-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, necessitating safer and more effective treatments beyond N-acetylcysteine (NAC).","Acetaminophen (APAP), which is also known as N-acetyl-p-aminophenol or paracetamol, is among the most frequently used tablets due to its analgesic and antipyretic properties. Especially in the era of the COVID-19 virus epidemic, because of its low price and significant effect on fighting fever and muscle soreness, it is often combined with other drugs and is easily overused frequently. Therefore, the safety of APAP is questionable. Studies have shown that its overdose might lead to hepatotoxicity and acute liver failure (ALF). APAP mediates the formation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine through cytochrome P450 in the human body, leading to mitochondrial oxidative stress and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which will lead to nuclear translocation of mitochondrial proteins and induce DNA fragmentation, eventually leading to liver cell necrosis. The drug-induced liver damage (DILI) observed with APAP is the second main reason for liver transplantation in humans. APAP-induced DILI is responsible for 50% of cases of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe, whereas in China, APAP-induced DILI is responsible for 50.8% of all cases of anti-inflammatory- and analgesic-induced DILI; therefore, it is urgent to develop safer and more effective drugs to treat liver injury induced by APAP. At present, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the only clinically approved antidote for APAP-induced liver damage. Because of its poor bioavailability, complicated drugs, limited administration time, and many side effects, it is necessary to design and construct a new nano-drug delivery system to find a solution."
TA042027_I_0002,"Mesoporous silica nanocarriers (MSNs) are highlighted for their high drug-loading capacity, versatility in targeted drug delivery, and ability to enhance cellular uptake and bioavailability, making them suitable for treating liver injury when functionalized with glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a liver-targeting ligand derived from glycyrrhizic acid.","Mesoporous silicon nanocarriers (MSNs) have high drug loading capacity and can load small molecular drugs, especially hydrophobic drugs. Up to now, MSNs have been developed for targeted drug, gene and protein delivery, and composite nano-drugs for diagnostic biological imaging, tissue engineering, cancer treatment, vaccine development, biomaterials, and diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, nano-loaded drugs can avoid drug degradation and physiological toxicity to healthy tissues caused by the premature exposure of drugs. Mesoporous silica with various specific modifications has attracted people’s interest as the carrier of nanoparticle drug delivery system. This approach enhances cellular-specific uptake to increase intracellular drug concentration and retain the drug in the targeted tissue. In addition, targeted nanoparticles include excessive drug load and ensure targeted delivery and improve bioavailability. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is an active aglycone of glycyrrhizic acid. Studies have proven that GA has numerous advisable pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antiulcer activities. Because GA molecules can provide a hydrophobic moiety and bind liver-targeting ligands, GA-mediated drug carrier structures have emerged as a novel liver-targeting platform. Studies have confirmed that GA receptors are present on the surface of liver (parenchymal) cell membranes, and GA can be highly accumulated in the liver. Studies have confirmed that GA receptors are present on the surface of liver (parenchymal) cell membranes, and GA can be highly accumulated in the liver. Compared to carriers not modified with GA, those modified with GA were reported to be more effective in livers or in targeting livers. In addition, GA-modified nanoparticles may exhibit an ability to distinguish normal liver tissue from diseased or damaged liver tissue, resulting in higher therapeutic efficacy and safety. In a word, it is a very promising scheme to embed GA into MSN and load drugs to treat diseases in the liver."

In particular, the team has a good research foundation on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and mechanisms of chitosan oligosaccharide on the liver. Previous studies have found that COSM has a good protective effect on liver injury. In this study, GA was selected as the target ligand to be covalently modified on the structure of MSNs. The ensuing glycyrrhetinic acid-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-NH2-GA) have potential for transferring unique capsules to LO2 cells. COSM, a polysaccharide product with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, was loaded into MSN-NH2-GA. The covalent bond between GA and MSN was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The structures and morphologies of MSNs and MSN-NH2-GA were investigated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS).

Then, 20 mL of ODE solution containing TEOS (10 v/v %) was added and reacted at 70 °C for 24 h to obtain MSN. MSN-NH2 was obtained by adding MSN to 25 mL anhydrous ethanol, adding 2.0 mL APTES, and reacting at 30 °C for 24 h. GA-NHS was obtained by adding 0.52 g NHS, 0.94 g DCC, and 1.0 g GA into 20 mL DMSO, and reacting at 40 °C for 24 h. Finally, GA-NHS and MSN-NH2 were added to DMSO and stirred at 60 °C for 24 h. MSN-NH2-GA was obtained by washing with DMSO and anhydrous ethanol for 3 times. FTIR spectra were obtained using an FTIR spectrophotometer (VERTEX 70v, Bruker GmbH, Bremen, Germany) to determine the profitable synthesis of MSN-NH2 and MSN-GA. The dimension distribution and zeta potential of the pattern nanoparticles were explored using a laser particle dimension analyser (Delsa, Beckman Technology Co., Ltd., Durahm, NC, USA). The morphologies of MSN and MSN-NH2-GA were observed by TEM (Tecnai G2 F20, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (XFlash 6130, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The unique structures and pore dimension distribution traits of MSN and MSN-NH2-GA were determined by nitrogen adsorption (ASAP2460, American Mack Instruments Co., Ltd., Colonial Heights, VA, USA).

Then, 10 mg of COSM was added and stirred slowly on a magnetic stirrer for 12 h. Finally, a high-speed centrifuge was used for centrifugation to collect the lower drug-loaded nanoparticles, which were freeze-dried for storage. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves were obtained using a synchronous thermal analyser (STA449, Netzsch, Selb, Germany) with a temperature range of 20 °C to 300 °C and a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The determination method of COSM content was established by DNS method, and the absorbance of COSM was determined by multifunctional enzyme-labeled instrument (MAXM4, Meigu Molecular Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and the standard curve of COSM was drawn (Figure S3).

TA042027_M_0002,"The human foetal hepatocyte LO2 cell line was cultured and used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the synthesized nanoparticles. The cells were treated with varying concentrations of COSM, MSN-NH2-GA nanoparticles, and COSM@MSN-NH2-GA nanomedicine, followed by exposure to APAP to induce liver injury. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 method, and the levels of AST and ALT were measured to evaluate liver injury. Cellular uptake studies were conducted using coumarin-6 (C6) as a fluorescent marker, and the uptake efficiency was analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.","The cell line was purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and was cryopreserved at the Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, with the human foetal hepatocyte LO2 mobile line. The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum and 1% FBS in a humidified incubator with a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. This protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University. First, LO2 cells were cultured and observed by microscope. Then, according to the previous experimental results (see attachment: Figure S2, Tables S1 and S2), the administration components were divided into high, medium, and low (H, M, L) COSM, (H, M, L) MSN-NH2-GA nanoparticles and (H, M, L) COSM@MSN-NH2-GA nanomedicine, with 8 replicate wells in each group. APAP was added at the modelling concentration for 12 h, the model group was treated with APAP only, the clean group was treated with an identical amount of medium, and the experimental group was treated with free drug COSM, nanoparticles MSN-NH2-GA, and the nanodrug COSM@MSN-NH2-GA and cultured for 12 h. The cytopathological state was observed to evaluate the therapeutic effect. In this study, the optimal concentration and time of APAP for modeling were screened (see attachment: Figure S4), and the cell viability was measured by CCK-8 method as the evaluation index. First, the cell culture medium was collected and centrifuged, and the contents of AST (C010-3-1, Nanjing Jiancheng Biological Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) and ALT (C009-3-1, Nanjing Jiancheng Biological Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) were measured according to the kit instructions. The survival state of adherent cells was detected by the CCK-8 method. Coumarin-6 (C6) is a liposoluble dye with strong fluorescence. It is commonly used in cellular uptake studies with nanoformulations. LO2 hepatocytes with cell viability meeting the experimental requirements were inoculated into a 24-well plate and incubated for more than 12 h until 80% of the cells adhered to the wall. The C6 solution and C6-NP nanosolution were diluted with serum-free medium so that both groups of C6 concentrations were 800 ng/mL and were washed 3 times with PBS. After culturing for 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h, the original medium was discarded, subjected to three 5 min washes with PBS, incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and washed 4 times with PBS after fixation.

TA042027_R_0001,"The study aimed to develop a nanocarrier system for treating acute drug-induced liver injury (APAP-induced). Uniformly dispersed mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and functionalized with glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) to target hepatocytes. The drug-loaded nanoparticles (COSM@MSN-NH2-GA) exhibited high drug loading capacity (28.36%) and improved biocompatibility. Characterization techniques (SEM, TEM, FTIR, DSC) confirmed successful synthesis and drug incorporation. In vitro experiments demonstrated enhanced cellular uptake and reduced liver injury markers (ALT, AST) in APAP-treated LO2 cells.","The nanomedicine, labelled COSM@MSN-NH2-GA, was synthesized in several steps (Scheme 1). Briefly, uniformly dispersed three-dimensional dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres were synthesized by referring to the preparation method by Shen’s team. These 3D dendritic MSNs exhibit unique advantages in protein loading and release due to their adjustable large porosity and intelligent layered mesostructure. More importantly, the release rate depends in part on graded biodegradation as 3D dendritic MSNs with larger pore sizes have a faster rate of biological interpretation. In this study, GA was selected as the target ligand, and by grafting alkoxysilane, MSNs were externally functionalized and finally anchored by amino reaction with amino-modified GA. COSM was loaded in ethanol by impregnation. The formed glycyrrhetinic acid-functionalized MSN nanoparticles exhibit the potential to specifically deliver drugs to hepatocytes. As shown in Figure 1a,b, SEM revealed that the MSN nanoparticles are spherical and exhibit a uniform particle size distribution. TEM showed that the MSN nanoparticles are spherical with clear and uniform mesoporous channels on the surface and a uniform particle size, which is consistent with the SEM results. After targeted modification, MSN-NH2-GA nanoparticles with a uniform particle size and complete morphology were obtained. The particle size distributions of MSN and MSN-NH2-GA nanoparticles are (156.7 ± 61.7) nm and (190.7 ± 78.1) nm, respectively (Figure 1c). The particle size of the nanoparticles gradually increases with the modification process. The nanoparticles are dispersed in different solvents, and the measured particle size is also inconsistent because the DLS measurement conditions are in aqueous solution. Therefore, the DLS results are slightly larger than the TEM particle size results. The zeta potential of the nanoparticles also reflects the macroscopic changes in the surface modification of the nanoparticles. Figure 1d shows that the zeta potential of the blank MSN was −40.42 ± 22.11 mV due to the presence of silanol groups on the MSN surface and its negative charge. After amino modification occurred, the amino group (positively charged) replaced silanol (which is negatively charged), so the zeta potential changed from negative to positive, and the zeta potential of MSN-NH2 was 58.62 ± 4.479 mV. When glycyrrhetinic acid was docked, part of the amino group was consumed and covered so that the positive charge decreased, and the zeta potential of MSN-NH2-GA became (7.013 ± 4.132) mV. To decide the chemical grafting of exceptional practical groups, MSN, MSN-NH2 and MSN-NH2-GA were characterised using distinct methods and after every reaction step. Using FTIR spectroscopy, we can see the functionalization manner of nanoparticles. Figure 2 shows that all samples show the skeleton absorption peaks of silicon-based materials, namely, the Si-O-Si symmetrical stretching vibration peak (800 cm−1), the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching vibration peak (1085 cm−1), and the Si-OH stretching vibration peak (960 cm−1). The infrared spectra peaks of MSN-NH2 are located at 2922 cm−1 and 2855 cm−1, which are the C-H stretching vibrations of APTES, indicating that the amino group was correctly modified. The amide II band at 1445 cm−1 and the C=C stretching vibration of GA at 1545 cm−1 indicate that the GA molecule is modified to MSN by amide bonds."
TA042027_R_0002,The mesoporous structure and drug loading efficiency of MSN-NH2-GA were confirmed through nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis and DSC. The nanoparticles showed reduced specific surface area and pore volume after GA modification but maintained high drug loading (56.72%). In vitro studies demonstrated that COSM@MSN-NH2-GA significantly improved hepatocyte viability and reduced ALT/AST levels in APAP-induced injury models. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed enhanced cellular uptake of GA-modified nanoparticles compared to free drugs.,"As seen in Figure 3a,b, the adsorption isotherm conforms to the Langmuir IV isotherm, and the nanomaterial exhibits a mesoporous structure. It can be seen that, when the relative pressure P/P0 < 0.35, N2 is present on the surface of the material channel. With single molecule and multimolecular layer adsorption, the amount of adsorption slowly increases. Under a relative pressure of 0.35 < P/P0 < 0.8, an obvious capillary condensation step can be observed, and the adsorption amount increases, indicating that the pore size distribution is wide. When 0.8 < P/P0 < 0.9, the nitrogen adsorption and the outer surface curve are gentle. When P/P0 > 0.9, there is a hysteresis loop. At this time, nitrogen adsorption occurs in the gap between the particles, the adsorption capacity increases, and the curve shows an additional large jump. The postgrafting method was used to modify the targeting group so that group modification would also occur in the pores of the nanoparticles. Figure 3b shows that the modification of amino and glycyrrhetinic acids exhibited a certain covering effect on the nanoparticles. As seen in Figure 4a,b, the MSNs had specific surfaces of 565.27 m2/g, contained pores with a size of 6.15 nm, and a volume of 1.18 cm3/g. MSN-NH2-GA had specific surface areas of 245.83 m2/g, showed pores with a size of 6.04 nm, and a volume of 0.69 cm3/g. Therefore, the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of MSN-NH2-GA decreased accordingly. To identify the COSM API, nanocarriers (MSN-NH2-GA), physically mixed groups, and nanopharmaceutical groups, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed. The results are shown in Figure 5. The black (A), red (B), blue (C), and green (D) curves represent the COSM, nanocarrier (MSN-NH2-GA), physical mixing, and nanomedicine (COSM@MSN-NH2-GA) groups, respectively. COSM exhibits an obvious single-melting endothermic peak at approximately 200 °C, while the nanocarrier (MSN-NH2-GA) group shows an obvious dehydration peak at approximately 100 °C. The DSC analysis of the physically mixed group contains characteristic absorption peaks of the carriers and COSM, which was because the drug and the carriers were simply mixed. In the DSC analysis of the nanodrug group, the characteristic absorption peak of the main drug (COSM) disappeared, indicating that COSM was present in an amorphous form in the nanodrug group and was no longer present in a crystalline state. These observations indicate that COSM was successfully incorporated into the mesoporous channels of MSN-NH2-GA. According to the previous experiments, the feasibility of using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) as a method for the determination of COSM content was determined, and the specific determination conditions were finally optimized and screened out. In the drug loading experiment, the dosage ratio of COSM and MSN-NH2-GA is 1:2, and the drug loading time is 12 h, which is the best drug loading condition. The encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was 28.36% and the load capacity (LC%) was 56.72%. LO2 was cultivated, 8000–10,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate were seeded, the cell state with a microscope was observed after about 10–12 h of culture; APAP modelling groups were set at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 mM. APAP was given to each group according to the preset setting, and the culture was continued for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h; the cell survival rate was measured by CCK-8 method, and the optimal concentration and time for modelling were determined. According to the results of nanomedicine cytotoxicity, the dosage of COSM@MSN-NH2-GA group was low dose (200 μg/mL), medium dose (400 μg/mL), high dose (800 μg/mL); in total, there was a group of six duplicate holes. The drug loading of COSM@MSN-NH2-GA is 28.36% ± 1.00%. By equivalent conversion, the dosage of the free drug COSM was low dose (56 μg/mL), medium dose (113 μg/mL), high dose (226 μg/mL); in total, eight duplicate wells were in each group, and they continued to culture for 12 h after adding the COSM drug. The experiment and results of this part are shown in the annex. LO2 hepatocytes were treated with APAP for 12 h and then treated with COSM, MSN-NH2-GA, and COSM@MSN-NH2-GA for 12 h. Then, the growth state of the cells were observed under the microscope. As shown in Figure 6, in the blank nanocarrier groups, MSN-NH2-GA(L), MSN-NH2-GA(M), and MSN-NH2-GA(H), basically no difference in the cell state and the number of dead cells was observed. This indicated that the blank nanocarrier did not improve the decrease of cell viability caused by APAP at each dose. Compared with the MOD group, the cell viability was not affected, which preliminarily proved that the nanoparticles were a safe and non-toxic nanocarrier. In the free drug group, the cell state of the COSM (L) group was close to that of the APAP model group, the normal hepatocytes in the COSM (M) and COSM (H) groups increased, the cell morphology was more normal, and the number of dead cells decreased. Each group treated with the nanodrug showed a decrease in the number of dead cells, but the middle-dose group and the high-dose group displayed the most pronounced effects of cell treatment due to the more normalized cell morphology and lower number of dead cells in these groups. The model group generally showed a substantially higher number of dead cells and significantly fewer normal liver cells than the normal control group. In addition, the appearance of many dead cells changed, displaying abnormal forms and decreased cell activity. The contents of ALT and AST in the medium were determined by collecting the culture medium, and the therapeutic effect of each administration group on APAP-induced LO2 hepatocyte injury was detected by CCK-8 method. As shown in Table 1, COSM@MSN-NH2-GA (M) and COSM@MSN-NH2-GA (H) treatment groups significantly increased hepatocyte survival and inhibited hepatocyte injury. In addition, compared with the APAP model group, the nanomedicine treatment could significantly reduce the contents of ALT and AST in the culture medium, as shown in Figure 7. In the high-dose group, compared to the free COSM, the nano-drug COSM@MSN-NH2-GA showed a more significant decrease in the indexes of ALT and AST. It can be speculated that the glycyrrhetinic acid receptor (GAR), as the most commonly used targeting effect, is overexpressed in hepatocytes. MSN-NH2-GA uses a receptor-mediated strategy to improve delivery efficiency and achieve better therapeutic effect. Taken together, the results indicated that COSM@MSN-NH2-GA could treat APAP-induced hepatocyte injury. Therefore, the combined use of COSM and MSN-NH2-GA can improve the vitality of hepatocytes and provide great hope for the treatment of APAP-induced hepatocyte injury. In this experiment, fluorescence microscopy was used to observe the cellular uptake behaviour of nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 8, at 5 min, no fluorescence could be observed in the C6-NP group, but blue nuclei stained with DAPI could be clearly observed. After 1 h, fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm of the cells. The fluorescence intensity of the C6-NP group was significantly enhanced, indicating that the targeted nanoparticles showed higher cell uptake ability. At 2 h, the fluorescence intensity of the C6-NP groups confirmed an increasing trend. In the C6-NP group, the Merge diagram showed mixed blue and green light, and the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cells exhibited much fluorescence. This result may be due to the above-mentioned specific GA-receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism, and a large number of C6-NPs nanoparticles are internalized by LO2 cells. In this experiment, flow cytometry was performed to analyse the cell uptake behaviour of nanoparticles (Figure 9). At 5 min, the fluorescence intensity of the free coumarin group (938.6 ± 115.7) was not considerably longer than that of the C6-NP group (923.8 ± 27.4). At 1 h, the cell fluorescence intensity of the nanoparticle group was maintained at a high level (11378.07 ± 2692.05), which was appreciably different from that of the free drug group (3082.83 ± 220.94). With increases in the reaction time, the fluorescence intensity of the nanoparticle group reached 12991.77 ± 2303.26 at 2 h, whereas the fluorescence intensity of the free drug group was 4746.3 ± 1990.77. This finding shows that compared with free drugs, targeted modified nanoparticles exhibit a stronger drug transport ability and are more easily taken up by cells. Overall, the uptake of glycyrrhetinic-acid-modified nanomedicines by cells was better. The results of fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry showed that the glycyrrhetinic-acid-modified nanoparticles exhibited a higher fluorescence intensity than that of the free C6 group at the same time and showed stronger fluorescence intensity faster, indicating that the treatment can significantly increase the uptake of nanomedicines by LO2 cells."

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: the study was to find a suitable treatment for acute drug-induced liver injury. The use of nanocarriers can improve the therapeutic effect of natural drugs by targeting hepatocytes and higher loads. METHODS: firstly, uniformly dispersed three-dimensional dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSNs) were synthesized. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) was covalently modified on MSN surfaces through amide bond and then loaded with COSM to form drug-loaded nanoparticles (COSM@MSN-NH(2)-GA). The constructed drug-loaded nano-delivery system was determined by characterization analysis. Finally, the effect of nano-drug particles on cell viability was evaluated and the cell uptake in vitro was observed. RESULTS: GA was successfully modified to obtain the spherical nano-carrier MSN-NH(2)-GA (≤200 nm). The neutral surface charge improves its biocompatibility. MSN-NH(2)-GA has high drug loading (28.36% ± 1.00) because of its suitable specific surface area and pore volume. In vitro cell experiments showed that COSM@MSN-NH(2)-GA significantly enhanced the uptake of liver cells (LO2) and decreased the AST and ALT indexes. CONCLUSION: this study demonstrated for the first time that formulation and delivery schemes using natural drug COSM and nanocarrier MSN have a protective effect on APAP-induced hepatocyte injury. This result provides a potential nano-delivery scheme for the targeted therapy of acute drug-induced liver injury."

In this study, components of essential oils from A. dalai-lamae, A. tangutica, A. sieversiana, A. tanacetifolia and A. ordosica were identified by GC-MS. A total of 56 constituents were analysed, and each species consisted of 9 to 24 constituents. Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed that A. dalai-lamae, A. tangutica and A. tanacetifolia are characterised by monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed the most remarkable similarity between A. sieversiana and A. ordosica, but the similarity was still lower than 50%. Contact toxicity and repellency of essential oils were evaluated by bioassays; A. ordosica oil exhibited the most substantial contact toxicity (LD50 = 52.11 μg/cm2) against Liposcelis bostrychophila, while A. tangutica oil showed the most potent contact toxicity (LD50 = 17.42 μg/adult) against Tribolium castaneum. Except for A. dalai-lamae, the other four species showed the same level (p > 0.05) of repellent activity as the positive control against both pests at high concentrations. The results indicated that these five Artemisia species had high chemical diversity and great potential to be developed into more effective and environmentally friendly anti-insect agents. ================= Discussion: The chemical composition of Artemisia species oils has high diversity. The oil has different protective effects due to various compositions, such as antibacterial activity, insecticidal effect, antiviral and repellent actions. Only essential oil components from A. sieversiana and A. ordosica have been reported before. Reports of the chemical constitutions of essential oils from these two kinds of Artemisia species indicated the high diversity caused by geographic locations (which may affect precipitation, temperature, edatope, etc.). The compositions of essential oils of A. sieversiana gathered from different regions of China in the flowering stage had a high level of variability. When sampling from Beijing, the essential oil contained eucalyptol (9.2%), geranyl butyrate (9.1%), camphor (7.9%), borneol (7.9%) and germacrene D (5.5%), whereas essential oils of A. sieversiana gathered from Tibet mainly consisted of α-bisabolol (34.47%), chamazulene (23.00%) and α-phellandrene (5.22%). In Ningxia, the oil was mainly chamazulene (29.61%), camphor (4.80%) and eucalyptol (4.32%). The essential oil extracted from A. ordosica collected from the southwestern boundary of Tengger Desert was mainly magnol (22.60%), trans-β-ocimene (11.60%), and acenaphthylene (11.00%). 2,5-Etheno[4.2.2]propella-3,7,9-triene (24.81%), trans-nerolidol (10.39%) and α-longipinene (8.82%) were the predominant compounds of the sample collected from the southeastern boundary of the Hopq desert. In the Mu Us desert, β-pinene (11.17%), limonene (11.41%) and capillene (9.46%) were the major components."
TA043641_D_0002,"The discussion continues by comparing the main compounds of the tested Artemisia oils with those of other species, noting similarities and differences. It also explores the impact of plant growth stages on oil composition, citing Ocimum americanum as an example. The repellent properties of Artemisia oils are well-documented, with previous studies showing effectiveness against various pests. The toxicity effects of the five Artemisia species oils are discussed, with A. ordosica and A. tangutica showing the highest contact toxicity. The mechanism of bio-action, including neurological effects and safety considerations, is also addressed, along with toxicity evaluations of other Artemisia species and their major constituents.","In our tests, the main compounds of tested oils also were found in other Artemisia species. For example, camphor, linalool and 4-terpineol were the major compositions in A. haussknechtii, and spathulenol, β-elemene, germacrene D were found in A. campestris. Caryophyllene was the main compound in A. lavandulaefolia and A. rubripes oils. It has also been reported that changes in the composition of volatile oils can also occur during plant growth stages. For instance, monoterpenoids, the major composing components (69.5–77.7%) of Ocimum americanum oil, were found to be maximal (77.7%) in the vegetative growth stage followed in the seed setting period (76.8%) and full flowering stage (74.2%), with the minimum at the half-flowering stage (69.5%). Recently, thousands of plants have been deemed as potential sources of repellents. The repellent properties of essential oils from the genus Artemisia were also well documented. In our previous research, five Artemisia species, including A. anethoides, A. giraldii, A. roxburghiana and A. rubripes were evaluated for their repellent activities on T. castaneum. The result indicated that the five essential oils were effective in repelling T. castaneum, and the sequence of their activity was A. rubripes > A. anethoides > A. roxburghiana = A. sacrorum = DEET (the positive control) > A. giraldii (p > 0.05). In another previous research, polyacetylenes were isolated from the essential oil of A. ordosica aerial parts. Although with low relative content, the three tested polyacetylenes (capillene, capillin and cis-dehydromatricaria ester) were proved to possess fair repellent and fumigant activities against T. castaneum adults. Additionally, A. lavandulaefolia essential oil and its six constituents were tested on Lasioderma serricorne. At 2 h after exposure, the same level of repellency (p > 0.05) was observed at doses from 0.63 to 78.63 nL/cm2. In other reports, A. vulgaris essential oil presented high repellent activity against T. castaneum. The essential oil extracted from A. scoparia had more marked repellent activity on Sitophilus oryzae and T. castaneum than Callosobruchus maculatus, but as a whole, the oil strongly repelled each species of tested pests. Moreover, in our tests, the main constituents of the five Artemisia species were proved to have a repellent effect. For example, 3-carene had over 85% of PR values against L. bostrychophila and T. castaneum after 2 h exposure. Caryophyllene had the PR values of 82% and 98% against T. castaneum after 2 h and 4 h exposure, respectively. These major components were also confirmed to be toxic to other insects, such as Aedes aegypti, Semanstus japonicus and Lasioderma serricorne. Therefore, this study and the previous reports proved that essential oils from the genus Artemisia have great potential to be developed as good repellent agents against storage insects. The different toxicity effects could be found based on the LD50 values of five Artemisia species oils obtained in this study. The essential oils from A. ordosica and A. tangutica exhibited stronger contact toxicity than others against L. bostrychophila and T. castaneum. The essential oil of A. sieversiana possessed weak toxicity against L. bostrychophila with a LD50 value of 195.51 μg/cm2, and no insecticide effect was observed in tested concentrations to T. castaneum. In the previous report, A. sieversiana also possessed weak contact toxicity against Sitophilus zeamais adults with an LD50 value of 112.7 mg/adult. No significant correlation was observed when combined with the LD50 values of principal components and essential oils. This is considered to be related to the content of components and the synergistic or antagonistic effect between compounds. Pavela et al. (2010) estimated the fumigant toxicity against Spodoptera littoralis larvae of 15 pairs of binary mixtures. It showed that nine mixtures had a synergistic effect, five mixtures had an additive effect, and one mixture had an antagonistic effect. It was also identified that 138 synergistic/antagonistic effects were detected among 39 compounds in binary mixtures via topical application against Trichoplusia ni. So it may need further study to reveal the relationship between the insecticidal activities of different compounds. The mechanism of bio-action of essential oils was recorded. For contact toxicity, substances could permeate through the skin of insects to act on the insects. Some of the substances could cause neurological disorders, for example, the inhibition of the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is an important enzyme to regulate synaptic transmission. The inhibition of AChE could lead to hyperexcitation, causing locomotor behaviour alternation. High concentrations or combined use of substances may generate the knockdown effect, reflecting acute toxicity. These phenomena make us care about the safety of applying essential oils and plant-derived substances. Although the potential toxicity to mammals or cells of these five Artemisia species has not been studied yet, the safety evaluation of some other species in Artemisia has been recorded. The water extracts of A. dracunculus showed a maximum tolerated dose to rodents at over 200 mL of extract (1:10)/kg bw. Essential oil from A. nilagirica had a LD50 value of 7528.10 µL/kg for male mice. The essential oil of A. herba-alba showed no significant cytotoxicity in macrophages at the concentrations of 1.25 µL/mL and no significant cytotoxicity to microglial cells and keratinocytes at concentrations up to 0.32 µL/mL. Moreover, the safety of the major constituents, 1,8-cineole, camphor, 3-carene and caryophyllene, was evaluated. After acute oral administration of 1,8-cineole, the LD50 value was 3849 mg/kg, while no significant changes in body weight and relative organ weight were observed in the subacute toxicity study. The natural form of camphor was not toxic at 100 mg·kg·b.w.−1 to mice. For 3-carene, the exposure by inhalation at 0.0014 mg/day was believed to be safe, and it could cause eye irritation at about 2.39 mg/mL air. Caryophyllene was not considered as a skin sensitiser, and the TTC (threshold of toxicological concern) of inhalation exposure was 0.012 mg/day, which is 117 times lower than the Cramer Class I TTC. However, essential oils from some Artemisia species were confirm to have toxicity to human. For example, volatile oil extracted from A. argyi could cause hepatocellular harm to cause liver injury. Although there was no direct evidence that these five essential oils are safe enough for use, combined with the toxicity of other essential oils from Artemisia and the major constituents, it can be assumed that these essential oils are at lower concentrations of safe use as insecticides."
TA050516_I_0001,"Microalgae are highlighted as sustainable sources of high-value compounds like carotenoids, with their rapid growth and adaptability to industrial photobioreactors making them ideal for biotechnological applications, while their antioxidant properties and diverse structures offer vast potential for medical and industrial uses.","Microalgae are known to produce molecules of interest for nutraceutic, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and carotenoids. The success of microalgae-derived production of compounds of interest at industrial scale is due to a number of key factors, the rapid accumulation in biomass being often considered one of the most important. Microalgae are a major source of non-enzymatic antioxidants, among which carotenoids are predominant. Marine microalgae are exposed to dramatic fluctuations in light intensity depending on weather conditions resulting from either reduced solar irradiation or mixing of the water column. Excess light energy damages the photosynthetic machinery, whereas insufficient light supply limits photosynthesis. Carotenoids are keys to the regulation of light input to the photosynthetic apparatus. They serve as accessory pigments to increase the capture of photons that are transferred to chlorophyll molecules, as well as to absorb photon excess under high light in order to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from photo-damage.Carotenoids, which are among the most potent antioxydants, have received much attention as potential anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory agents. Several carotenoids are produced industrially for their antioxidant properties and/or as staining agents in aquaculture. Astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis and Chlorella zofigiensis was shown to significantly reduce the presence of free radicals and thus counteract oxidative stress. Astaxanthin also has potential in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. β-carotene, which accumulates in Dunaliella salina at up to 14% dry weight, is a vitamin A precursor in humans. Molecules derived from β-carotene, like lutein and violaxanthin, have anti-inflammatory properties. Lutein is also used in eye therapies; in particular to treat age-related macular degeneration. Although carotenoid activities rely mainly on their antioxidant properties, the diversity of their chemical structures, with more than 700 reported molecules, opens a vast field of investigation and potential applications for these molecules."
TA050516_I_0002,"The production of carotenoids at an industrial scale requires optimization of culture conditions and strain selection, with various stresses like light, nitrogen, temperature, and salinity influencing carotenoid accumulation, while metabolic engineering offers alternative strategies for enhancing production through enzyme manipulation and strain modification.","The production of carotenoids at an industrial scale requires: (i) the optimization of culture conditions for carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation and (ii) the selection of overproducing strains. Various stresses induce carotenoid accumulation. Cordero et al. (2012) demonstrated that the regulation of the carotenogenic pathway of Chlorella zofingiensis was influenced by light and nitrogen. Both light and nitrogen-starvation stress enhance the accumulation of β-carotenoid, such as astaxanthin, canthaxanthin or zeaxanthin. This stress, however, had also an antagonistic effect on the production of α-carotenoids. Temperature stress of 40 °C was also shown to induce β-carotene accumulation up to 5% of dry weight in Tetraselmis sp.. Finally, high salinity induces lipid and carotenoid production in Chlorella zofingiensis but reduces growth rates, leading to biomass decrease.Metabolic engineering provides an alternative for selecting strains that overproduce carotenoids of interest. A zeaxanthin over-expressing strain was obtained by mutagenesis in Dunaliella. Phytoene synthase (psy) is a key enzyme involved in the first step of carotenoid synthesis. The over-expression of Chlorella psy enhances the accumulation of violaxanthin and lutein in Chlamydomonas and of β-carotene in Scenedesmus sp.. The heterologous expression of the lycopene β-cyclase/lycopene ε-cyclase/light-harvesting complex-fusion protein from the green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus allowed the modulation of the ratio between α- and β-pathways in bacteria. This enzyme may, therefore, be a target of interest for metabolic engineering of carotenoid synthesis in Ostreococcus cells."
TA050516_I_0003,"Ostreococcus, as a model organism with genetic tools and ecological adaptability, is studied for its potential in producing high-value carotenoids under controlled stress conditions, with three strains examined for their specific responses to light, temperature, and salinity to optimize industrial production.","The genus Ostreococcus (Mamiellophyceae) was originally discovered in the Thau lagoon and described as the smallest free-living eukaryotes. Since the early sequencing of the Ostreococcus tauri OTTH595 strain, genetic transformation was implemented including gene targeting by homologous recombination. Ostreoccocus has become a model organism to address biological questions such as circadian clock architecture, cell-cycle regulation or the regulation of iron homeostasis. Picophytoplanktonic eukaryotes belonging to Mamiellophyceae (Ostreococcus, Micromonas and Bathycoccus), have a worldwide distribution representing the 4th most abundant group in sequence numbers in the TARA Ocean Cruise. Several strains of Ostreococcus have been sequenced and comparative analysis has revealed the existence of “strains or ecotypes”, which are adapted to specific ecological niches with respect to light intensity (depth) or iron requirements.Ostreococcus cells present several traits of interest as a source of high added-value molecules for biotechnologies. In addition to a fast growing rate, this microalga contains high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated omega fatty acids such as DHA. Ostreococcus cells are also a rich source of carotenoids including those that are widely distributed such as violaxanthin, antheraxantin or zeaxanthin, or Mamiellophyceae-specific carotenoids such as micromonal, uriolide or prasinoxanthin.We have studied the potential of three Ostreococcus strains (OTTH595, RCC809 and RCC802) to produce specific carotenoids in response to light, temperature and salinity stress in batch conditions. Growth rates were also determined to evaluate the potential of these strains to produce carotenoids in continuous culture maintained in an exponential phase of growth."
TA050516_M_0001,"The study involved cultivating three strains of Ostreococcus (OTTH595, RCC802, RCC809) in artificial seawater under controlled conditions of light, temperature, and salinity. The strains were grown in flasks or deep-well plates, with growth rates monitored using flow cytometry. Carotenoid extraction and analysis were performed using HPLC, and statistical methods were applied to compare productivities under different stress conditions.","Microalgal strains of Ostreococcus tauri (OTTH595), Ostreococcus lucimarinus (RCC802) and Ostreococcus sp. (RCC809) were obtained from Roscoff culture collection. The strains were cultivated in 100 mL flasks or 96-deep well plates (Nunc, Perki Elmer, Hessen, Germany), in filtered artificial seawater (24.55 g·L−1 NaCl, 0.75 g·L−1 KCl, 4.07 g·L−1 MgCl2·6H2O, 1.47 g·L−1 CaCl2·2H2O, 6.04 g·L−1 MgSO4·7H2O, 0.21 g·L−1 NaHCO3, 0.138 g·L−1 NaH2PO4 and 0.75 g·L−1 NaNO3) supplemented with trace metals and vitamins. Cultures were maintained under constant gentle agitation at 20 °C in an orbital platform shaker (Heidoph shaker and mixer unimax 1010) under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Realistic sunlight irradiation curves were applied during the light period with a maximum of 150 µmol quanta m−2·s−1 at solar noon in temperature-controlled incubators (Panasomic MIR-154-PE). For temperature, light and salinity experiments, algal cells inoculated in triplicate at 1 million cells·mL−1 in 50 mL flasks or deep well microplates (1.5 mL wells) were first acclimated for 7 days in the tested condition. Cells were refreshed at 1 million cells·mL−1 in deep wells for growth rate experiments or 50 mL flasks for carotenoid analysis. Experiments were first performed to explore growth rates under different salinities (15–60 g·L−1 of NaCl), temperature (12–30 °C) and light intensities (50–1200 µmol quanta m−2·s−1). For growth experiments, all samples from biological triplicate (20 µL) were fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldricht, St Louis, MO, USA) for 15 min at room temperature, before being frozen on dry ice. Samples were stored at −20 °C until cell counting. The cell number was determined using a BD accury C6 flow cytometer. The growth rate was determined as described below."
TA050516_M_0002,"Carotenoids were extracted from filtered algal cells using methanol and sonication, followed by HPLC analysis to identify and quantify pigments. Growth rates and carotenoid productivities were calculated, and statistical methods, including multivariate redundant analyses, were used to compare the effects of different stress conditions on carotenoid production.","Based on growth rates the following conditions were selected for carotenoid analysis. For light experiments, 12 h light:12 h dark cycles were applied with light intensities at solar noon of 50 µmol quanta m−2·s−1 for low light (LL), 150 µmol quanta m−2·s−1 for standard light, 800 µmol quanta m−2·s−1 (HL) and 1200 µmol quanta m−2·s−1 (HL+) for high light depending on the light tolerance of the strain. For temperature experiments, temperature of 12 °C (LT−), 15 °C (LT), 27.5 °C (HT) and 30 °C (HT+) were used depending on the strain tolerance. For salinity experiments, conditions of either low salinity (15 g·L−1 of NaCl) of high salinity of 50 g·L−1 NaCl (HS50) or 60 g·L−1 NaCl (HS60) depending on the strain tolerance. At the end of the culture, the 50 mL of culture was filtered onto a cellulose membrane GF/F 25 mm, (pore size 0.7 µm filters; Dominique Dutscher: 036334B) in darkness. Then filters were carefully dried to remove artificial sea water (ASW) before being transferred to cryotubes that were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stores at −80 °C prior to carotenoid analysis. Cells of each sample were also fixed for counting by flow cytometry. The carotenoids on the GF/F filters were extracted at −20 °C in 3 mL methanol 100% and disrupted by sonication for 2 h. Separation and identification of the carotenoids were carried out using HPLC 1200 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The methanol extract was mixed (1:1) with a buffer solution tetra-butylammonium acetate (TBAA) 28 mM and then, injected onto a narrow reversed-phase C8 Zorbax Eclipse XDB column (3 × 150 mm; 3.5 μm particle size) which was maintained at 60 °C. Elution of carotenoids was achieved within 28 min on a gradient between a solution (A) of TBAA 28 mM: methanol (30:70; v:v) and a solution (B) of 100% methanol according to the following program: (t (min); %B; %A), (0; 10; 90), (25; 95; 5), (28; 95; 5). Pigments were detected using a diode array detector, at 450 nm for carotenoids and 667 nm for chlorophyll a and its derivatives. Peak assignments and quantization were undertaken using carotenoid standards. Chemicals and reagents of HPLC grade were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Carotenoid content normalized to the cell number (determined by flow cytometry) was expressed in pg·g·L−1·cell−1. The productivity in 7-day batch culture (Pbatch) corresponding to the concentration of carotenoids produced by day was expressed in µg·L−1·d−1. For each culture condition the cell number was determined by flow cytometry daily, for a week. The growth rate in batch culture can be determined as Ln(N)/dt, where N is the cell concentration per mL (cells·mL−1) and T the time (days). The maximal growth rate (µmax) was determined on a graph expressing the neperian logarithm of cell concentration as a function of time of culture. µmax corresponded to the slope of the linear part of the growth curve (i.e., excluding the lag phase and the stationary phase). Nfmax is number of cells at end of exponential growth phase; N0 is number of cells inoculated; T is the time (days) at the end of exponential growth phase. In our batch conditions, cells were either at the end of the exponential phase of in the exponential phase, depending on the stress applied. To estimate the theoretical maximal cell number in continuous culture in which cells are maintained in the exponential phase of growth all the time (chemostat). We used the following equation: Tbatch is the duration of the batch culture (7 days in our experiments). It follows that the theoretical maximal carotenoid productivity in continuous culture maintained in the exponential phase of growth (Pmax) is: Nf is the number of cells obtained at the end of the batch culture, Pbatch is carotenoid productivity in the batch determined experimentally. Analyses were performed in triplicate for each microalgae sample (n = 3). Means and standard deviations of the raw data and regression analysis of calibration samples were carried out using R statistic software. A test of normality, Shapiro–Wilkinson, (p > 0.05) followed by one way analysis of t-test variance was used to compare stressed conditions to the standard. Values were considered to be statistically significant when p < 0.05. Multivariate redundant analyses (RDA) were conducted using the Vegan package to compare carotenoid productivities under different stress conditions. Analysis of similarity (ADONIS) was performed to compare groups. A resemblance matrix was built up based on pairwise Bray–Curtis distances. Similarity percentages (SIMPER), based on a non-parametric permutation procedure, were used to determine the contribution of each factor (i.e., each carotenoid) to the dissimilarities between groups."
TA050516_R_0001,"The study compares carotenoid production in three Ostreococcus strains (OTTH595, RCC802, RCC809) under varying light, temperature, and salinity conditions. The strains, isolated from different environments, exhibit distinct growth and carotenoid profiles. OTTH595, from a fluctuating lagoon, shows adaptability to a wide temperature range and low salinity, while oceanic strains RCC802 and RCC809 prefer stable conditions. Carotenoid content and productivity vary strain-specifically, with high light favoring xanthophyll accumulation and specific stresses enhancing certain carotenoids.","Three Ostreococcus strains were selected for comparative analysis of carotenoid production under light, temperature or salinity stress conditions (Table 1). Two strains (RCC802, RCC809) are oceanic; the third strain is the original strain of Ostreococcus (Ostreococcus tauri, OTTH595) that was isolated from the Thau Lagoon. Both RCC802 (Mediterranean) and RCC809 (Atlantic tropical) come from deep environments where light is limited; RCC809 was described as a low-light strain. Based on sequence homology RCC802 is an Ostreococcus lucimarinus strain, a species described as “high-light adapted”. These three strains differ in term of temperature niches. The Thau lagoon (OTTH595) is a shallow environment displaying dramatic fluctuation in temperature over the year (4 °C to 30 °C) whereas RCC802 and RCC809 were isolated from the environment where the temperature is fairly stable over the year. Similarly, the salinity of the Thau lagoon is subject to large variations because of flood events and strong evaporation in summer. It should be noted also that the three strains belong to different phylogenetic clades (A, B and C).We first determined the ability of Ostreococcus strains to survive and grow in response to changes in light, salinity and temperature conditions (Table 2). In all experiments cultures cells were exposed to 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, the light period mimicking realistic solar curves of irradiation (see Material and Methods). The standard light condition corresponded to a light intensity of 150 μmol quanta m−2·s−1, at solar noon, temperature of 20 °C and salinity of 36 g·L−1. Cultures were acclimated for one week in each light/temperature conditions and refreshed before measuring the growth rate. Depending on the stress applied, differences were observed between the three strains. While both OTTH595 and RCC809 grew between 12 °C and 32 °C, RCC802 displayed lower temperature preferences between 10 °C and 27.5 °C. OTTH595, unlike RCC802 and RCC809, grew under low salinities (7.5 g·L−1 of NaCl), while RCC802 did not survive at salinities below 15 g·L−1 of NaCl. All three strains tolerated high salinities of 65 g·L−1 of NaCl. Under low light (50 μmol quanta m−2·s−1) growth was detected only in OTTH595. All strains except RCC802 were able to grow at light intensities up to 1500 μmol quanta m−2·s−1 at solar noon. The highest specific growth rates were observed under the standard light conditions for OTTH595 (1.66 d−1), RCC809 (1.64 d−1) and RCC802 (1.52 d−1)."
TA050516_R_0002,"Carotenoid quantification revealed strain-specific responses to stress. RCC809 had the highest total carotenoid content under standard conditions, while OTTH595 showed peaks under high temperature, light, and low salinity. Cellular carotenoid concentrations were highest under specific stresses for each strain. Light intensity notably increased xanthophylls like violaxanthin and antheraxanthin, particularly in OTTH595 and RCC809. Temperature and salinity had minimal effects on carotenoid profiles, except for violaxanthin. Prasinoxanthin was the dominant carotenoid across strains, with its cellular content peaking under high temperature or low salinity.","Cultures were grown in 50 mL batches, as described in the above section, under various conditions. Carotenoids were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Table 3). In the standard culture condition, RCC809 had the highest content of total carotenoid (250.5 µg·L−1). In OTTH595, the highest concentrations were found under high temperature (279 µg·L−1), high light (266.2 µg·L−1), and low salinity (265.4 µg·L−1) and the lowest content was detected under low light (33.3 µg·L−1) and low temperature (18.5 µg·L−1) with a more than 15-fold reduction between the high-temperature and low-temperature conditions. In RCC802, the highest concentration of carotenoids was obtained at low salinity (431.1 µg·L−1). We also estimated the concentration of carotenoids per cell to take into account the differences in growth rates between stress conditions (Table 3). The highest cellular concentrations of total carotenoids were observed at 27.5 °C for OTTH595 (11.09 pg·cell−1) and at 30 °C for RCC809 (7.70 pg·cell−1), but for this latter strain this was not significantly higher than in the standard condition (6.23 pg·cell−1) in a Student’s t-test (p-value < 0.05). The highest cellular concentration of carotenoids occurred under low salinity in RCC802, (9.27 pg·cell−1) corresponding to a 2-fold increased compared to standard conditions.The relative concentrations of α- and β-carotenoids are shown in Figure S1. The β-carotenoid relative content increased and conversely the α-carotenoid relative content decreased under high light irradiances (Figure S1A). The increase of β-carotenoid was more pronounced in OTTH595 and RCC809 (from 39% to 52% and from 40% to 51%, respectively) than in RCC802 (from 41% to 45%). High or low salinity had either a moderate effect on the relative content in α- and β-carotenoids in OTTH595 or no significant effect in RCC809, but low salinity favored the α-pathway in RCC802 (Figure S1B). An increase in temperature from 12 °C to 30 °C had similar effects on α- vs β-carotenoids content for OTTH595 and RCC802 with a decrease of the β-pathway (from 39% to 34% in OTTH595 between 12 °C and 30 °C and from 41% to 39% in RCC802 between 12 °C and 27.5 °C) relative to the α-pathway increase (Figure S1C).We investigated the effect of light intensity on the carotenoid profiles inferred from HPLC analysis (Figure 1). Ten carotenoids were identified, in all three strains. Prasinoxanthin was the most abundant molecule, representing between 30% and 35% of total carotenoid content. Increasing light intensity resulted in a dramatic accumulation of xanthophylls, including violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin, in the three strains. This changes between standard light and high light were more pronounced for violaxanthin in RCC809 (from 13% to 23% of total carotenoid) and for antheraxanthin in OTTH595, (from 0.62% to 7.22% of total carotenoid). Zeaxanthin and lutein also increased in response to light in these two strains but not in RCC802. Finally the xanthophyll neoxanthin did not change in response to light in any of the strains.Temperature and salinity had almost no impact on carotenoid profiles in batch cultures (Figures S2 and S3). Only, violaxanthin content decreased slightly with temperature level in all the strains. When looking at the cellular content, prasinoxanthin was the most abundant carotenoid in all strains, reaching under high temperature up to 2.36 pg·cell−1 and 2.51 pg·cell−1 in OTTH595 and RCC809, respectively, and 3.19 pg·cell−1 under low salinity in RCC802 (Table S3). Violaxanthin increased strongly in response to high light, high temperature and low salinity in OTTH595 (0.67, 0.66 and 0.70 pg·cell−1, respectively) but it was maximal only under low salinity in RCC802 (1.21 pg·cell−1) and it remained fairly constant under all stress conditions in RCC809. Under high light, antheraxanthin levels were 25 fold higher in OTTH595 (0.25 pg·cell−1) compared to standard conditions, but its level changed only by 2 fold in RCC802 and RCC809 (0.13 pg·cell−1 and 0.07 pg·cell−1, respectively)."
TA050516_R_0003,"Multivariate analysis highlighted stress-specific influences on carotenoid productivity. High temperature and low salinity were key for OTTH595 and RCC802, respectively, while RCC809 showed minimal stress impact. Prasinoxanthin and violaxanthin were major contributors to variability. High light significantly boosted violaxanthin and antheraxanthin productivity, especially in OTTH595. Theoretical maximal productivities indicated optimal conditions for each strain, with high light favoring OTTH595 and standard conditions suiting RCC802 and RCC809. The study underscores the potential of tailored culture conditions for strain-specific carotenoid optimization.","The productivity of each carotenoid was determined in batch cultures after 7 days, i.e., either during or at the end of the exponential phase of growth depending on the stress applied. To compare carotenoid profiles in the three strains under various stress conditions, a multivariate analysis was performed (Figure 2). The first component accounted for most of the variability observed under the different stress conditions (92.99% for OTTH595, 87.69% for RCC809 and 97.91% for RCC802). Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that prasinoxanthin was the main carotenoid influencing group separation along the first component. Together the first and the second component accounted for 99% of the observed variability. Violaxanthin and to some extent antheraxanthin influenced the separation of samples by the second component, although this was less pronounced for RCC802. Analysis of variance using distance matrices (ADONIS) was performed to create a matrix of similarity to compare the different groups corresponding to biological triplicates of each strain under specific stress conditions. Most groups were statistically different in similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis (p-value < 0.001). However differences were noted between the different strains depending on the stress condition applied. High temperature and low salinity were the main parameters influencing carotenoid productivity in OTTH595 (Figure 2A), and in RCC802 (Figure 2C), respectively, but the productivity was not impacted by stress in RCC809 (Figure 2B). In contrast, high light influenced violaxanthin productivity in all strains, and antheraxanthin in OTTH595.The productivities of 148 carotenoids of 240 quantified (24 samples) were found to be significantly different from the control (p-value ≤ 0.05 in a paired parametric Shapiro–Wilk t-test). Under standard culture conditions, the prasinoxanthin productivity in the batch culture was 7.74 µg·L−1·d−1; 11.19 µg·L−1·d−1 and 7.09 µg·L−1·d−1 for OTTH595, RCC809 and RCC802, respectively. Under specific stress conditions, significant increases were observed, reaching up to 12.35 µg·L−1·d−1 at high temperature for OTTH595 and 21.15 µg·L−1·d−1 at low salinity for RCC802, These results confirmed that low salinity and high temperature stimulate prasinoxanthin production in RCC802 and OTTH595, respectively (Table S1). Similarly, violaxanthin productivity increased in response to high light conditions for the three strains. Noteworthy antheraxanthin productivity was strongly enhanced under high light conditions (2.72 µg·L−1·d−1) in OTTH595 compared to control condition (0.16 µg·L−1·d−1).We next estimated the theoretical maximal productivity in the exponential phase of culture based on growth rate in each stress condition, as determined earlier (Table S2). Multivariate RDA analysis was performed to compare the different conditions (Figure 3). Under batch conditions, prasinoxanthin and violaxanthin/antheraxanthin were the main pigment correlated to the variability of the first and second component, respectively. Carotenoid productivities, in particular prasinoxanthin, were influenced by high light, in OTTH595 (Figure 3A), and they were not affected much by stress in RCC809 (Figure 3B). In RCC802, the productivity was influenced by high light and to some extent by low salinity (Figure 3C).In agreement with these results, we noted in RCC802 a maximal productivity of prasinoxanthin under standard conditions (55.08 µg·L−1·d−1) and RCC809 (52.24 µg·L−1·d−1), respectively, and under high light in OTTH595 (100.77 µg·L−1·d−1) (Table S2). Violaxanthin productivity reached up to 73.81 µg·L−1·d−1 in OTTH595 when exposed to high light, while in RCC802 and RCC809 the maximal productivity was higher under standard conditions (23.55 and 28.09 µg·L−1·d−1, respectively). Antheraxanthin maximal productivity (27.91 µg·L−1·d−1.) was the highest in OTTH595 (compared to 0.57 and 2.82 µg·L−1·d−1 maximal productivities in RCC809 and RCC802, respectively).RDA was also performed for the three strains, considering α- and β-carotenoids globally (Figure S4). The α-pathway influenced the variability of the first component while the β-pathway influenced the second component also. The low salinity had a moderate impact on the α-carotenoid productivity in RCC802 and the high light strongly influenced the α- and β-pathway in OTTH595, in particular when considering the maximal productivity (Figure S4).Figure 4 summarizes the optimal conditions for the production of the main carotenoids either in batch or extrapolated under the exponential phase condition. The low salinity condition was optimal for the maximal production of prasinoxanthin in RCC802 in the batch. The high light condition, in contrast, was more favorable for prasinoxanthin maximal production in OTTH595. Violaxanthin productivity was highest under high light and low salinity in RCC802 in batch conditions. The theoretical maximal productivity for violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin + lutein, however, was the highest in OTTH595 exposed to high light."
TA050516_D_0001,"The study compares carotenoid production in three Ostreococcus strains under varying light, salinity, and temperature conditions. Carotenoid profiles and productivities varied strain-specifically, with OTTH595 showing high-light adaptation and RCC802 responding to low salinity. The findings highlight the potential of these strains for biotechnological applications under controlled conditions.","In this study we compared the potential of three strains of the genus Ostreococcus to produce carotenoids under a wide range of light, salinity and stress conditions. Carotenoid profiles similar to those previously described were detected by HPLC. Ten pigments were resolved including some that were specific such as prasinoxanthin, uriolide, micromonal and one unknown, as well as more common carotenoids such violaxanthin, antheraxantin, zeaxanthin + lutein, neoxanthin, dihydrolutein and α/β carotene. Under our standard batch conditions of light (150 μmol quanta m−2·s−1, temperature (20 °C) and salinity (36 g·L−1 of NaCl) the cellular concentrations of total carotenoid were variable between strains (4.62, 2.01 and 6.24 pg·cell−1 for RCC802, OTTH595 and RCC809, respectively). The carotenoid productivities, however, were similar in 7-day batch culture for, RCC802, OTTH595 and RCC809 (167.613 µg·L−1, 179.44 µg·L−1, 250.50 µg·L−1, respectively) because of differences in growth rates between the three strains (Table 2).We observed that the carotenoid content is modulated quantitatively and qualitatively by abiotic stresses with strain-specific responses. The differential effect of high light stress was noted between the strains with respect to the quantitative and qualitative content of the carotenoids (Figure 2, Table 3 and Table S3). In OTTH595, a 7-fold induction was observed in total cellular carotenoid content between low light and high light, but in other strains the total cellular content of carotenoids decreased under high light (Table 3). Higher growth rates were also observed under high light in OTTH595. As a result, despite cellular carotenoid content being lower under high light (3.52 pg·cell−1) than under high temperature (11.09 pg·cell−1), production in 7-day batches were almost equivalent between the two conditions (266.256 µg·L−1 vs. 278.981 µg·L−1). OTTH595 is a lagoon strain that was described as a high-light 'ecotype', whereas RCC809 and RCC802 are deep strains and considered low-light ecotypes. These differences in light niches may account for the differences observed in the light-dependent regulation of carotenoid synthesis. Carotenoids are located within the thylakoid membrane inside the chloroplast where they are associated with protein-like light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) which absorb light and transfer its energy to chlorophyll, triggering the photochemical events of photosynthesis. Xanthophylls play an important role in the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against photo-oxidative damage. The conversion of violaxanthin into zeaxanthin, in the violaxanthin cycle, is a well-known mechanism involved in photoprotection. Violaxanthin dissipates the excess of PSII excitation energy into heat through non-photochemical quenching. We were not able to quantify zeaxanthin, since lutein and zeaxanthin cooeluted in our HPLC analysis, as previously described. Antheraxanthin is an intermediate in the violaxanthin cycle. In OTTH595, violaxanthin increased in response to high light by a two-fold factor (Table S3). Differences in the levels of antheraxanthin were observed between low and high light, with a 25-fold induction in OTTH595 but only a 2-fold induction in the two other strains. The conversion of antheraxanthin into zeaxanthin is, therefore, likely to be less efficient in OTTH595. Although the biological meaning of antheraxantin accumulation in OTTH595 under high light is not clear, our observation suggests that Ostreococcus tauri could be an interesting source of antheraxanthin as well as zeaxanthin + lutein (Figure 4)."
TA050516_D_0002,"High temperature and low salinity significantly enhanced carotenoid content in OTTH595 and RCC802, respectively, suggesting their role in stress adaptation. Prasinoxanthin was a major contributor to increased productivity under stress. The study also explores the potential biomedical applications of Ostreococcus carotenoids, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties, and suggests future research directions for optimizing industrial production.","High temperature was the major factor enhancing carotenoid content in OTTH595 with 11.09 pg·cell−1, while low salinity strongly stimulated carotenoid content in RCC802 (9.26 pg·cell−1). These results suggest that carotenoids could contribute to the adaptation of strains to specific environmental niches. RCC802, for example, does not grow below salinities of 15 g·L−1 NaCl and accumulates high amounts of carotenoids under this low-salinity condition. The induction of carotenogenesis by salinity has been documented in other microalgae such as Haemotococcus or Dunaliella. Carotenoid accumulation, in contrast, is enhanced under high temperature in OTTH595, a strain that was isolated from the Thau Lagoon, an environment marked by large temperature fluctuations (Table 3 and Table S3). This effect of temperature has been reported in other microalgae strains such as Chlorella vulgaris. Prasinoxanthin, the main carotenoid pigment in Prasinophyceae, accounted the most for the increased carotenoid productivity in response to low-salinity and high-temperature stress in RCC802 and OTTH595 (Figure 2). It should be noted, however, that under these conditions the cellular content of all carotenoids increased (Table S3). No specific induction of the β-pathway, in particular xanthophylls, was observed, unlike under high light. This suggests that the primary function of carotenoids under these salinity and temperature conditions is not photoprotection. The global induction of carotenoids in RCC802 and OTTH595 in response to low salinity and high temperature suggest that their accumulation is, rather, a response to oxidative stress arising from either temperature or osmotic stress. Such an induction of carotenogenesis, in particular lutein, is triggered in Muriellopsis sp. by reactive oxygen species induced by high temperature.Ostreococcus strains contain specific Prasinophyceae-specific carotenoids such as prasinoxanthin, micromonal or uriolide and one unknown molecule representing more than 50% of total carotenoids, for which no biological activity have been described. As carotenoids are strong antioxidants, most of them reduce oxidative stress associated with diseases such as diabetes, cancer and eye pathologies. Microalgal carotenoids including fucoxanthin, cantaraxanthin or astaxantin have anti-proliferating capacity. Astaxanthin, in particular, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of bladder, colon or leukemia cells. It would be of great interest to test the activity of Ostreococcus prasinoxanthin, micromonal or uriolide. Several carotenoids of the beta family including zeaxanthin, lutein, or violaxanthin exhibit anti-inflammatory activities. Under high light stress, OTTH595 accumulates up to around 20% of violaxanthin and OTTH595 up to 7% of antheraxanthin, but antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin + lutein levels remained low in RCC809 (3.7% and 6%). Comparison of the activities of carotenoid extracts of the different strains grown under specific condition (e.g., OTTH595 and RCC809 under high light) could give insights into the biological activity of these carotenoid extracts.In our experiments, carotenoids were quantified at the end of exponential phase. Under these conditions RCC802 appeared to be the most interesting strain for the production of total carotenoids. Extrapolation of productivities based on growth rates in the exponential phase, however, suggest that OTTH595 could potentially produce more carotenoids under high light because of higher growth rates. In the future, it would be interesting to combine stresses such as high light and salinity to improve carotenoid productivity. The effect of nitrogen starvation could also be tested alone or in combination with the other stresses. Considering industrial production of carotenoids in industrial photobioreactors exposed to natural sunlight, our results suggest that OTTH595 would be the most interesting strain, in particular in summer when light intensity and temperature are high. In winter, however, when light intensity is reduced, RCC809 or RCC802 under low salinity conditions would be less expensive to produce."

It highlights the significance of studying carotenogenesis in Ostreococcus tauri, a model picoeukaryote, and describes the comparative analysis of carotenoid production and growth rates across different strains under varying environmental conditions.","Title: Comparative Analysis of Culture Conditions for the Optimization of Carotenoid Production in Several Strains of the Picoeukaryote Ostreococcus. Abstract: Microalgae are promising sources for the sustainable production of compounds of interest for biotechnologies. Compared to higher plants, microalgae have a faster growth rate and can be grown in industrial photobioreactors. The microalgae biomass contains specific metabolites of high added value for biotechnology such as lipids, polysaccharides or carotenoid pigments. Studying carotenogenesis is important for deciphering the mechanisms of adaptation to stress tolerance as well as for biotechnological production. In recent years, the picoeukaryote Ostreococcus tauri has emerged as a model organism thanks to the development of powerful genetic tools. Several strains of Ostreococcus isolated from different environments have been characterized with respect to light response or iron requirement. We have compared the carotenoid contents and growth rates of strains of Ostreococcus (OTTH595, RCC802 and RCC809) under a wide range of light, salinity and temperature conditions. Carotenoid profiles and productivities varied in a strain-specific and stress-dependent manner.

TA044129_I_0001,"The introduction outlines the clinical significance of acute kidney injury (AKI) and its association with ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), highlighting the role of inflammatory responses and macrophage polarization in AKI progression and repair, while introducing asiaticoside as a potential therapeutic agent derived from Centella asiatica with known anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects.","Acute kidney injury (AKI), a common clinical syndrome defined by an abrupt decline in renal excretory function, has an incidence rate of about 5–15% in hospitalized patients. Evidence suggests that even mild AKI is associated with a reduction in long-term survival. This is because the onset of AKI can lead to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the major causes of AKI, which induces microvasculature alterations, robust inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and necrosis. However, the mechanism that regulates the repair process after AKI has not yet been fully elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that inflammatory cascades of chemokines AND cytokines, the infiltration of macrophages and stress oxidative processes modulate the injury and repair stage of AKI. It has also been reported that macrophages, as innate immune cells, have pathogenic roles in AKI. Notably, mature macrophages respond to environmental signals through two polarization programs: classically activated macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated ones (M2). These two programs can be activated or inhibited by various cytokines, including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Interleukin-33 (IL-33). Macrophages play an essential role in driving the progression or repair of IRI, depending on their activation stage and phenotype. Asiaticoside, a traditional Chinese medicine, is one of the primary active compounds derived from Centella asiatica (L.) Urban. Previous studies have revealed that asiaticoside has numerous beneficial effect, including anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic, osteoclastogenesis, and immunoregulation effects. Moreover, asiaticoside plays a critical role in chronic renal fibrosis, podocyte damage and diabetic nephropathy by regulating the expression of cytokines and the renal immune response. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of asiaticoside on acute kidney injury. This study aims to investigate the protective role of asiaticoside on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in IRI model mice and its regulation of macrophage polarization in LPS-treated mouse macrophage cell line. In the present study, we hypothesize that asiaticoside protected kidney from IRI, which may be because of the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and promoting transformation of macrophages from M1 type to M2 type."

The protective effect was related to the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and transformed M1 and M2 marker expressions of Raw264.7 cells. An ischemic renal injury mouse model was established by clamping the bilateral renal pedicle for 25 min. Results showed that BUN and Scr levels were significantly increased in IRI groups at day 1 compared to the Sham group (Figure 1(a, b)), indicating that the IRI model mice were successfully established. Next, IRI mice were administered with saline or different doses of asiaticoside to explore the effects of asiaticoside. We found that the levels of BUN and Scr were almost recovered within 48 h in the asiaticoside-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1(a, b)). Collectively, these findings indicated that asiaticoside can promote renal function in IRI mice. To investigate the functions of asiaticoside on the inflammatory response in IRI mice, we examined the inflammatory cytokine expressions using ELISA. Results indicated that renal ischemia-reperfusion injury significantly elevated the levels of IL-1β (Figure 2(a)), IL-6 (Figure 2(b)), TNF-α (Figure 2(c)), and IL-10 (Figure 2(d)) in the kidney compared to Sham groups. After asiaticoside intervention, the levels of IL-1β (Figure 2(a)), IL-6 (Figure 2(b)), and TNF-α (Figure 2(c)) were obviously alleviated. However, asiaticoside treatment further enhanced the expression of IL-10 (Figure 2(d)) induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury. The effect of asiaticoside on the infiltration of macrophages in kidney tissue of IRI model mice was detected by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 3). The fluorescence distribution of F4/80 in the kidney tissue of IRI model mice was significantly enhanced compared to Sham groups. The results showed that macrophage infiltration was increased in the kidney tissue of IRI model mice. Surprisingly, asiaticoside treatment could reduce the fluorescence intensity of F4/80 in kidney tissue. It indicated that asiaticoside inhibited the infiltration of macrophages in the kidney tissue of IRI model mice."
TA044129_R_0002,"Asiaticoside demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced Raw264.7 cells by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10, while promoting M2 macrophage polarization by suppressing iNOS and enhancing Arginase1 expression.","The levels of IL-1β (Figure 4(a)), IL-6 (Figure 4(b)), TNF-α (Figure 4(c)), and IL-10 (Figure 4(d)) inflammatory factors were higher in the LPS group compared to the control group. However, the levels were reduced by asiaticoside. In contrast, the level of IL-10 (Figure 4(d)) was higher in the asiaticoside treatment groups than in the LPS group. These findings suggest that asiaticoside inhibited the inflammation induced by LPS in Raw264.7 cells. There was no change in the secretion of inflammatory factors Raw264.7 cells under asiaticoside treatment alone compared to the control group (Figure 5). Treatment with 100 μM asiaticoside attenuated the activation of IL-1β (Figure 5(a)), IL-6 (Figure 5(b)) and TNF-α (Figure 5(c)), but LPS-treated cells increased IL-10 from the control and asiaticoside augmented this increase. To further clarify the mechanism underlying the effects of asiaticoside on LPS-induced Raw264.7 cells, western blot analysis was performed to elucidate the potential pathways. Results showed that LPS increased the expression of M1 marker (inducible NO synthase-iNOS) and M2 marker (Arginase1) in Raw264.7 cells (Figure 5(e)). After asiaticoside treatment, the expression of iNOS (figure 5(f)) was suppressed, but the expression of Arginase1 (Figure 5(g)) was further improved. This suggested that asiaticoside ameliorated the inflammatory response induced by LPS through M2 polarization."
TA044129_D_0001,"The study explores the protective effects of asiaticoside on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating its ability to reduce inflammatory markers and promote macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 type.","This study found that asiaticoside ameliorated the increased levels of serum BUN and Scr, as well as inflammatory factors, induced by renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Moreover, Raw264.7 cells with LPS-induced inflammation, exhibited enhanced inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10, but asiaticoside did not attenuate the increase in IL-10. In addition, asiaticoside treatment induced Raw264.7 cells toward M2 polarization by regulating M1 and M2 markers. It is well known that IRI is a systemic inflammatory disease. A previous study reported that the repair of renal IRI is associated with the production and release of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. Cellular mediators of immunity, such as macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer T, T and B cells, contributes to the pathogenesis of renal injury and repair after IRI. For example, IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine, secreted by a variety of immune cells including regulatory T cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, and helper T cells. IL-10 modulates the innate and adaptive immune responses, through exerting immunosuppressive functions to reduce tissue damage. Meanwhile, the regulatory immune cell network is activated by the mutual regulation of TNF-α and IL-10 to maintain immune homeostasis after IRI. TNF-α can induce a variety of inflammatory gene expression, thereby increasing inflammation. These studies confirm our findings, and indicate that the secretion of IL-10 and TNF-α was stimulated by LPS in macrophages. However, asiaticoside treatment attenuated IRI-induced inflammation by adjusting the expression of inflammatory mediators."
TA044129_D_0002,"The role of macrophages in renal IRI is discussed, highlighting the shift from M1 to M2 polarization induced by asiaticoside, along with the implications for future research.","Macrophages are involved in both inducing renal damage and promoting renal repair after renal IRI. On one hand, M1 macrophages express high levels of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase and proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6, TNF-α and IL-12. On the other hand, M2 macrophages tend to promote wound healing and inflammation resolution by inducing IL-4 and IL-13, which are anti-inflammatory factors. NO synthases (NOS) isoforms synthesize NO, a small signaling molecule. Among them, the third NOS isoform (iNOS) is negligible in resting cells and stimulated by cytokines and bacterial LPS. Arginase1 is one of members of the arginase family. Differential metabolism of L-arginine is characteristic of M1 and M2 macrophages by iNOS and Arginase1. The M1 and M2 macrophage activation stems from exactly these alternative metabolic states reflected by iNOS/Arginase1 balance. Recent evidences suggest that Arginase1 plays a fundamental role for M2 macrophages to acquire the phenotype. In the future study, we will use the blockers and interference to investigate the exact molecular mechanism by which asiaticoside promotes the transformation of macrophages. Surprisingly, the expression of iNOS-M1 marker was suppressed after asiaticoside treatment, but the expression of Arginase1-M2 marker was further improved. Collectively, these findings suggest that asiaticoside played a role on the polarization state of macrophages to some extent. However, further studies should be conducted to discover the molecular mechanism of asiaticoside on macrophage polarization regulation, and these results should also be verified in human disease."
TA044129_C_0001,"The study investigates the protective effects of asiaticoside on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) both in vivo and in vitro. Ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) is a leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), a significant global health issue. Asiaticoside is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and tissue repair properties, but its role in AKI caused by I/R is not well understood. The research demonstrates that asiaticoside reduces blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) levels in IRI models, mitigates inflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α), and increases anti-inflammatory IL-10 in a dose-dependent manner. In LPS-stimulated Raw264.7 cells, asiaticoside counteracts inflammation, inhibits iNOS expression, and promotes Arginase1, indicating macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 type. The findings highlight asiaticoside's potential therapeutic role in renal IRI by modulating inflammation and macrophage behavior.","Title: Protective effects of asiaticoside on renal ischemia reperfusion injury in vivo and in vitro. Abstract: Ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) is the main causes of acute kidney injury (AKI), which is a global health concern. Evidence suggests that asiaticoside plays vital roles on anti-inflammatory and, anti-kidney fibrosis effects, and promotes tissue repair. However, the effects of asiaticoside on AKI caused by ischemia-reperfusion have not been well defined. Herein, we explored the protective effect of asiaticoside on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) using in vivo and in vitro studies, and elucidated the potential mechanism of asiaticoside-mediated repair. Results showed that asiaticoside attenuated the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) in the IRI model. Meanwhile, asiaticoside reduced the secretion of IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α, but increased IL-10 secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Treating Raw264.7 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced an inflammatory response, but the LPS-induced effects were attenuated after administering asiaticoside. Furthermore, asiaticoside significantly inhibited the expression of inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) and promoted the expression of Arginase1 induced by LPS, which are the polarization marker proteins. In conclusion, this study shows that asiaticoside possesses protective action in AKI after ischemia-reperfusion, due to the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and promoting transformation of macrophages from M1 type to M2 type."

TA041175_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the importance of recycling food side streams like black currant pomace, which is rich in nutrients but often discarded, and discusses the potential of using the edible fungus Wolfiporia cocos for fermentation to produce a pleasant beverage.","In a situation of depriving resources, great needs for sustainable solutions for feeding the growing population arise. Recycling of food side streams becomes thus more and more important. Pomace, as a pressing residue of the juice industry, represents a readily available and highly interesting side stream. Pomace mainly consists of fruit skin, kernels, pulp, and juice residues. As it is rich in fiber, protein, valuable unsaturated fatty acids, dyes, vitamins, and phytochemicals, pomace can contribute to a healthy diet (Farooque et al.; Struck et al.). Particularly, potentially healthy nutrients are anthocyanins, flavonoids, tannins, phenolic acids, and hydroxycinnamates, which may have a positive influence on cardiovascular-associated, ocular, and neurodegenerative neoplastic diseases (Farooque et al.; Gopalan et al.). Black currant pomace is typically characterized by a very low pH value of 2.6–2.8. This ensures a comparatively high microbiological stability, but complicates its recycling by traditional fermentation processes (Bagger-Jørgensen and Meyer). Attempts to use pomace as a substitute for flour in baking products, as an ingredient in smoothies, as a source of antioxidants, or as a substrate for alcoholic fermentation have been published (May and Guenther; Rohm et al.; Struck et al.). Nevertheless, it is still predominantly used for composting, biogas production, as feed or burned for power generation (May and Guenther; Rohm et al.).Utilization of this side-stream has a great potential for saving resources, improving the efficiency of crop growing, and reducing costs (May and Guenther). As black currant spritzer is a popular drink, its pomace may be particularly suitable for use in novel beverages. Fermented beverages have been consumed for ages as fermentation may improve taste, texture, nutrients, and shelf life (Hugenholtz). Alcohol-free fermented products are traditionally associated with health benefits and are currently becoming more and more popular. Examples of alcohol-free beverages, which are fermented by bacteria and yeasts, comprise, e.g. Kombucha, Kvass, water kefir, and Bionade (Hugenholtz; Marsh et al.). In recent studies, microorganisms like Lactobacillus species act as an additive for functional beverages with proposed health benefits (Hashemi et al.; Jouki et al.). Furthermore, some rare examples of beverages produced with higher fungi have been published. Besides using Trametes versicolor, Lentinula edodes, and Flammulina velutipes, W. cocos was successfully used to biotransform tea or wort leading to a highly pleasant flavor (Rigling et al.; Wu et al.; Zhang et al.). These fungi belong to the division of Basidiomycota, which are known for their unique properties to utilize nutrients. As they can degrade cellulose and hemicellulose, they can use substrates, which are otherwise hard to upcycle (Bouws et al.). Especially W. cocos has been reported to be a highly suitable biocatalyst to produce pleasant aromas and fruit acids. It is an edible medicinal mushroom, which is also known in China as Fu Ling or Indian Bread (Wang et al.). Highly fragrant compounds like linalool, methyl anthranilate, phenyl ethanol, benzaldehyde, methyl phenylacetate, and geraniol have been detected in several studies (Rigling et al.; Sommer et al.; Wu et al.).In this study, W. cocos was used as a biocatalyst to upcycle black currant pomace for the beverage industry. Suitable culture conditions to produce a pleasant taste and odor from black currant pomace were identified, and relevant aroma compounds and fruit acids were identified and quantified."

TA041175_M_0001,"The study utilized various chemicals and authentic standard compounds procured from commercial suppliers for experimental purposes. The edible medicinal fungus Wolfiporia cocos was maintained on malt extract agar and pre-cultured in malt extract medium. The pre-culture was homogenized, centrifuged, and washed before inoculation into main cultures. Medium optimization involved testing different concentrations of black currant pomace and adjusting pH levels. Fermentations were conducted under controlled conditions, with scaling up from small Erlenmeyer flasks to a larger fermenter. The process parameters included specific rpm, air vent flow, and temperature settings.","Chemicals were obtained from the following suppliers: acetone (99.8%) from Acros Organics B.V.B.A., sodium carbonate (≥ 99%, water free), sulfuric acid (98%), d-glucose, malt extract, and sodium hydroxide (≥ 98%) from Carl Roth GmbH & Co.

W. cocos (No. 279.55) was purchased from CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre (Utrecht, Netherlands). Frozen black currant pomace of the cultivar Ribes nigrum L. cv. Tihope was provided by the Department for Pomology, Geisenheim University (Geisenheim, Germany). Fermentations were performed under similar conditions as described in the literature (Rigling et al.; Zhang et al.) W. cocos was maintained on malt extract agar (20 g L−1 malt extract, 15 g L−1 agar–agar). All media were prepared with drinking water and autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. As pre-culture, 200 mL ME medium (20 g L−1 malt extract) in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask was inoculated with an overgrown agar plug (diameter 0.4 cm) and homogenized using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (T25, IKA-Werke GmbH & CO. KG, Staufen, Germany) for 30 s with 10,000 rpm. After incubation for 7 days at 24 °C with shaking at 150 rpm in the dark, the pre-culture was homogenized and centrifuged for 5 min at 10 °C at 3,500 g. The supernatant was disposed and replaced with autoclaved drinking water. Main cultures were inoculated with 10% (v/v) of the washed pre-culture and cultivated with 150 rpm at 24 °C in the dark. For medium optimization, pomace concentrations of 60 g L−1, 80 g L−1, 100 g L−1, and 120 g L−1 were evaluated. The pH-value was adjusted to 4.4 before autoclaving with NaOH. pH measurements were performed with a Five Easy™ pH bench meter FE 20 (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, USA), which was calibrated each day using buffers of pH 2, 4, and 7 pursued from Carl Roth GmbH+ Co. KG. Sugar solutions were autoclaved separately and added to the medium before inoculation in equally sweet concentrations of 100 mL L−1 sucrose-syrup (580 g L−1 sucrose), 89 mL L−1 fructose-syrup (574 g L−1 fructose) and 167 mL L−1 glucose-syrup (502 g L−1). 75 mL L−1 sucrose syrup were added to test reduced sugar content. The final medium composed of 80 g L−1 black currant pomace and 100 mL L−1 sucrose-syrup (corresponding to 58 g L−1 sucrose) was fermented for three to four days until a pH 3.5 ± 0.1 was reached. The culture volume was scaled-up from 0.2 L in 0.5 L Erlenmeyer flasks (EF), 0.8 L in 2 L EF, 2 L in 5 L EF to 4 L in a 7.5 L fermenter (Labfors 3, Infors GmbH, Einsbach, Germany). The process parameters for the fermenter were 150 rpm (propeller stirrer), 1 L min−1 air vent flow during the first three hours, 0.3 L min−1 air vent flow afterwards, and 24 °C. The pH was continuously measured with a pH electrode (405-DPAS-SC-K8 S/120, Mettler Toledo), which was calibrated as reported above."
TA041175_M_0002,"After fermentation, the beverage was processed by removing solid matter using cheesecloth and carbonated under pressure with food-grade carbon dioxide. Microfiltration and pasteurization were investigated, with the beverage treated with an enzyme before cross-flow filtration. The permeate was pasteurized, cooled, and carbonated before bottling. Analytical methods included sugar quantification using a sucrose/d-fructose/d-glucose assay kit and fruit acid analysis using ion chromatography with a conductivity detector. Sensory analysis was conducted by a trained panel to evaluate odor, taste, and acceptance. Flavor compounds were analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry–olfactometry (GC–MS–O), with compounds identified by retention indices, mass spectra, and perceived odors.","After fermentation, mycelium and other solid matter were removed with a cheesecloth (100% cotton). The beverage was carbonated under pressure with 1.7 bar of food grade carbon dioxide (2.5, Praxair Deutschland GmbH) for three days at 4 °C. To investigate the influence of microfiltration and pasteurization, 15 L of the fermented beverage was produced in 5 L EF containing 2 L medium. Prior to filtration, the beverage was treated with 0.67 mL L−1 of Fructozym Flow UF (Erbslöh Geisenheim GmbH; Geisenheim, Germany) for 3 h at 4 °C. For cross-flow filtration, the beverage was cooled and treated with a Romicon Hollow Fiber Cartridge (100 µm, Koch Separation Solutions, Massachusetts, USA) at 2 bar. The permeate was short time-pasteurized for a few seconds at 78 °C, cooled down to 4 °C, and carbonated for three days (5 g L−1 CO2). Afterwards, the sparkling beverage was filled into 0.33 L bottles with the Juice dispenser PAS1-PAS2-81-V2 (mabo Steuerungselemente GmbH, Epplingen, Germany) and pasteurized (45 min, 78 °C) (Fig. 1). Sugars were quantified with the sucrose/d-fructose/d-glucose assay kit from Megazyme Ltd. (Wicklow, Ireland). Fruit acids were analyzed using an ion chromatograph with a conductivity detector (883 Basic IC Plus, Deutsche METROHM GmbH & Co. KG, Filderstadt, Germany). For analysis of acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, and tartaric acid, a Metrosep organic acids column (250 · 7.8 mm, Metrohm) and a pre-column (Metrosep Organic Acids Guard, 50 · 4.6 mm, Metrohm) were used. The eluent consisted of 0.5 mM H2SO4 in deionized water/acetone (85/15, v/v) with a constant flow of 0.5 mL min−1. The injection volume was 20 µL. Samples were diluted with deionized water (1:8), filtered (PET, 0.45 µm, MACHEREY–NAGEL, Düren, Germany), quantified with external calibration, and identified by addition of the respective standards. Oxalic acid was quantified with a Metrosep A sup 4-350 column (250 · 4.0 mm, Metrohm) using an eluent of 1.8 mM Na2CO3 and 1.7 mM NaHCO3 in deionized water/acetone (98/2, v/v) and a flow of 1 mL min−1. The suppressor solution consisted of 50 mM H2SO4 in deionized water. Samples were diluted with pure water (1:40), filtered (0.45 µm), identified by addition of the standard, and quantified by external calibration. For sensory analysis by a trained panel (n = 20, 10 male, 10 female, non-smokers, 17–44 years old), beverages were served at 4 °C in 40 mL glasses. Experiments were performed at white light. Each participant received 20 mL of the beverages and was asked to rate odor, smell, and acceptance. Regarding smell, participants evaluated the following attributes from 0 (no odor) to 5 (intense odor): black currant, carrot, citrus, flowery, fruit tea, fruity, honey, red currant, rose hip, sour, strawberry, sweetish, and berries of the forest. The taste also was rated from 0 to 5 for the attributes astringent, black currant, bitter, carrot, citrus, flowery, fruit tea, fruity, honey, red currant, rose hip, sour, sweet, and berries of the forest. Furthermore, each participant was asked about acceptance from 0 (I would not buy it) to 10 (very tasty, I would buy it). Flavor compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry–olfactometry (GC–MS–O) performed on an Agilent 7890B GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) in combination with an Agilent 5977B MSD and an ODP 3 (GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG, Mülheim a.d. Ruhr, Germany). It was equipped with a TDU 2, and a CIS 4 (all GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG). A VF-WAXms and a DB-5 ms column were used (both 30 m · 250 µm · 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies). 2 mL of samples were extracted at 24 °C for 1 h and 150 rpm with a Twister (PDMS, 10 mm, 0.5 mm film thickness, GERSTEL GmbH & Co.

A constant flow of carrier gas (1.56 mL min−1, helium 5.0; Nipon Gasses GmbH, Hürth Germany) was equally split between MSD and ODP. The GC oven was heated to 40 °C (3 min)/5 °C min−1/240 °C (12 min). The MSD was operated in scan mode (source 230 °C, 70 eV, m/z 33–300). GC-O analyses were performed by three participants (3 females, 24–28 years, non-smokers). Compounds were identified by comparison of retention indices (RI) according to van den Dool and Kraatz, recorded mass spectra, perceived odors, and in comparison to literature data (van den Dool and Kratz). Fragments used for relative quantification are listed in Table S1 (Supporting information). GC analyses and SBSE extractions were performed as described above, but the GC was not equipped with an ODP, a TDU (GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG) was used and the column flow was 1.2 mL min−1. Standard addition was performed with three steps by adding 0.5 mL standard solutions or 0.5 mL pure water to 2 mL of the beverage in 20 mL headspace vials (Table S2, Supporting information). 3,4-Dimethylbenzaldehyde, trans-nerolidol, phenylacetic acid, and terpinene-4-ol were quantified with splitless injection, and the other compounds with a split ratio of 50. Peak areas were determined using the fragments listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information) and plotted on the y-axis against the added mass. The intersection of the regression curve (x) was determined and the concentration (c) was determined with the used volume of the beverage (V) (Formula 1). The odor activity value (OAV) was determined by dividing the concentration (c) by odor thresholds (OT) (Formula 2) (Grosch). Samples were analyzed in random order. Averages, standard deviations, confidence intervals, and regression curves were determined with Excel. Sensory tests were performed by trained panelists and the statistical analysis of acceptance, odor and taste impressions were done with Excel using two-sample t-test for independent samples assuming different variances with α = 0.05 (Supporting Information, Table S3).

TA041175_R_0001,"The study explores the upcycling of black currant pomace, a byproduct of juice production, into a fermented beverage using the edible fungus Wolfiporia cocos. The pomace is rich in nutrients but typically discarded. W. cocos was chosen for its enzymatic capabilities to convert pomace into pleasant aroma compounds. The fermentation process was optimized for medium composition, scaling, and filtration, resulting in a beverage described as honey-like, floral, and fruity. Key flavor compounds such as linalool, geraniol, and phenylacetic acid were identified, exceeding their odor thresholds. The beverage received high consumer acceptance ratings.","Pomace as a side stream from black currant juice production is mostly discarded, even though it is rich in nutrients like protein, fiber, sugars, anthocyanins, polyphenols, and other secondary metabolites. Fungi from the division of Basidiomycota have a great enzymatic toolbox to recycle these complex mixtures of nutrients. In particular, the edible medicinal fungus Wolfiporia cocos has been described as a suitable biocatalyst to form pleasant aroma compounds in fermentation processes. Therefore, medium optimization, upscaling, and filtration were performed to produce a beverage based on black currant pomace fermented with W. cocos. A trained panel described the beverage as highly pleasant, reminiscent of honey, flowers and berries with a well-balanced sour and sweet taste. The flavor compounds linalool (citrus), geraniol (flowery), phenylacetic acid (honey), methyl phenylacetate (honey), eugenol (clove), and 2-phenylethanol (rose) were produced during fermentation and the concentrations exceeded their respective odor thresholds. The produced beverage was evaluated with 8.0 ± 1.4 from 10 for the question of whether panelists would buy the product. Fungal fermentation with the edible fungus W. cocos enabled the production of a highly pleasant beverage and additionally may reduce waste by using pomace and table sugar as sole ingredients."
TA041175_R_0002,"The fermentation process and sensory evaluation of the black currant pomace beverage are detailed. The pomace initially had a strong black currant scent, which changed during autoclaving. Fermentation with W. cocos enhanced fruity and honey-like flavors. Medium optimization revealed that 80 g L−1 pomace and 58 g L−1 sucrose were ideal for flavor development. The pH drop during fermentation, driven by oxalic acid production, contributed to a pleasant sour taste. Scaling experiments confirmed consistency in flavor profiles across different volumes. The final product was filtered, carbonated, and pasteurized, retaining its desirable sensory attributes. GC-MS analysis identified key aroma-active compounds, highlighting the transformation of pomace into a unique beverage.","The pomace had a strong scent reminiscent of black currant and colored the medium intensely red. During autoclaving, odor and taste changed and the color of the medium turned towards brown (Figure S1). Firstly, the characteristic black currant-like odor disappeared and the scent was reminiscent of berries, fruit tea, and carrot juice. The fermentation of the pomace-sugar-water suspension by W. cocos resulted in the formation of intense fruity and honey-like flavors. For medium optimization, the pomace content of 60 g L−1 was sequentially increased to 120 g L−1. A more intense taste and a denser mouth feeling, combined with a less watery impression resulted from higher pomace contents (Table S4, Supporting Information). Fermentations with 100 g L−1 or more showed a highly scented flowery-like odor, which was undesirable for a fruity beverage. The addition of sucrose prior to fermentation was essential for the aroma production. Reduced sugar content or the addition of sucrose after fermentation were both evaluated as less pleasant and reminiscent of fruit tea (Table S5, Supporting Information). Besides sucrose, the suitability of fructose and glucose was evaluated, and the odor profile was rated similarly but as less intense. The sour taste was weaker, and the beverage was overall rated as less tasty (Table S5, Supporting Information). Therefore, 80 g L−1 pomace and 58 g L−1 sucrose were chosen as the most suitable substrate for fermentation. An increased sour taste was observed during fermentation. The starting pH value of the cultures was 4.4 ± 0.2 after autoclaving which slowly decreased during the first hours of fermentation. The concentrations of citric acid changed barely during fermentation; 1000 ± 50 mg L−1 were detected in the non-fermented medium, and 1050 ± 10 mg L−1 in the fermented product after four days. The concentrations of oxalic acid increased strongly during fermentation from 8 ± 1 mg L−l before fermentation to 1,990 ± 630 mg L−1 after four days. Oxalic acid is the simplest dicarboxylic acid and occurs in several plants like spinach and rhubarb, animals, and bacteria (Noonan and Savage). It has a pleasant, characteristic, and astringent taste (Noonan and Savage). Cultures with a pH value of 3.5 revealed a pleasantly sour taste. The pH value was thus used as an indicator for the time of harvesting. All determined oxalic acid concentrations for fermented beverages with pH values of ≥ 3.5 were below 300 mg L−1. To test whether the produced beverage is suitable for a large-scale production, the fermentation was scaled up in shaking flasks. All cultures showed the characteristic odor and taste observed in the small-scale fermentations. The time of harvesting as defined by reaching a pH value of 3.5 ± 0.1 led to highly comparable impressions and proved the robustness of the pH value as an indicator for the termination of the fermentation process. Depending on the respective culture volume, the final pH value of 3.5 was reached after different fermentation periods. In 0.2 L in 0.5 L EK, a pH value of 3.5 was reached after 2.5 days, in 0.8 L in 2 L EK after 3 days, and in 2 L in 5 L EK after 4.5 days. Furthermore, the fermentation was performed in a fermenter with a volume of 4 L, in which a pH of 3.5 was reached after 4 days (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The flavor profile and the detected aroma compounds were highly similar to those observed in the smaller volumes (Supporting Information, Figure S3). This indicated that the fermentation process could be easily adapted to a bigger scale. For pilot scale processing, 15 L of the fermented drink was produced using 5 L EF with 2 L culture volume. The oxalic acid content of the non-processed drink directly after fermentation was 232 ± 3 mg L−1. During the filtration, the color changed to a lighter, intense red color. The beverage retained the pleasant sour–sweet character and 935 ± 20 mg L−1 of citric acid and 192 ± 2 mg L−1 oxalic acid were determined. The unique sour taste of citric acid and the sour and astringent taste of oxalic acid matched the impression of the beverage very well. Especially oxalic acid played an important role for the fruity and fresh taste of the fermented product."
TA041175_R_0003,"The sensory and chemical analysis of the fermented beverage is presented, comparing pre- and post-fermentation attributes. The non-fermented substrate was rated as unpleasant, while fermentation with W. cocos improved its sensory profile, removing undesirable carrot-like notes and enhancing fruity, honey-like, and berry flavors. GC-MS-O analysis identified key aroma compounds, such as linalool and geraniol, which were absent or minimal in the unfermented medium. The beverage's sugar content was comparable to commercial sugar-reduced drinks, supporting its market potential. The study also discusses the safety and regulatory considerations of W. cocos fermentation, noting its traditional use and low toxicity. Oxalic acid levels in the beverage were deemed safe for occasional consumption, being significantly lower than in foods like spinach or rhubarb.","Prior to the fermentation process, the participants of the panel rated the medium as not tasty enough to buy it and evaluated it with 2.5 ± 2.4 of 10 (Fig. 2A). After fermentation and carbonization, the acceptance increased significantly. The bottled drink, which was additionally filtered and pasteurized, was rated similarly high (8.0 ± 1.4 of 10). The non-fermented substrate had a strong impression reminiscent of carrots, which was evaluated as unpleasant (Fig. 2B). The fermentation with W. cocos changed the odor profile and removed this unpleasant note. Furthermore, the perception of the impressions fruity, sweetish, berries of the forest, and honey increased. After processing, the profile remained similar, but the odor impression intensities slightly decreased for the attributes fruit tea, fruity, berries of the forest, and black currant. The taste profile also changed during fermentation (Fig. 2C). Similar to the odor, the carrot-like impression was perceived before fermentation and disappeared due to bioconversion. Regarding the taste, the attributes sour, black currant, fruity, and berries of the forest increased. Between the bottled and the non-processed sample, the differences in taste were weaker in comparison to the odors. The sour taste induced by oxalic acid correlated well with the concentrations of the fruit acids (Table S6, Supporting information). The sweet taste was comparable in all products. As indicated in Table S7 (Supporting Information), the sugar content did not change strongly during the processing steps. The bottled beverage fermented with W. cocos had a sugar content of 49 ± 1 g L−1. In particular, 2.7 ± 0.9 g L−1 glucose, 4.8 ± 0.8 g L−1 fructose, and 42 ± 0.22 g L−1 sucrose were detected. Several beverages with a reduced sugar content have been launched in the past. The following sugar contents were found by comparing 183 beverages on the German market: 51 ± 9 g L−1 in sugar-reduced lemonades, 62 ± 14 g L−1 in Fassbrause-varieties (a traditional German fermented drink), 86 ± 17 g L−1 in classical lemonades, and 92 ± 9 g L−1 in soft drinks. The sugar amount of the fermented pomace beverage is comparable to those of sugar-reduced lemonades and Fassbrause, which both have high consumer acceptance. GC–MS–O analyses of the non-fermented and the fermented beverage were performed to investigate the origin of the honey-like, flowery, and fruity odor. The chromatogram of the fermented beverage included several compounds, which were not detected in the non-fermented medium (Fig. 3A, B). To detect aroma compounds, GC-O measurements were performed with three participants, and 14 odor impressions were detected by at least two participants (Table 1). The identified compounds were quantified by means of standard addition. All regression curves had a coefficient of determination > 0.98. The concentrations of linalool 5, geraniol 7, phenylacetic acid 14, methyl phenylacetate 7, eugenol, and 2-phenylethanol 10 exceeded the odor thresholds (Table 2, Fig. 4A). Therefore, these compounds do likely influence the overall flavor impression. 1-Octen-3-ol 3, 2-nonanol 4, terpinene-4-ol 6, 2-nonanone 2, and trans-nerolidol 11 showed odor activity values below 0.1, and therefore most likely did not contribute to the overall aroma. Methyl phenylacetate 7 and phenylacetic acid 14 are known for their intense honey-like scent, and geraniol 9, 2-phenylethanol 10, and linalool 5 for their flowery and citrus-like notes. Eugenol 13 has a sweetish odor and is characteristic of clove. These compounds were absent in the non-fermented beverage or only detected in minor amounts (Fig. 4B). During the processing of the fermented beverage, the intensities of methyl phenylacetate 7 and geraniol 9 decreased, whereas the areas of the other compounds stayed constant. The compounds which define the pleasant aroma of the beverage are not typical for black currants. 4-Methoxy-2-methyl-2-butanthiol, (3Z)-hexenal, 1-octen-3-one, 1,8-cineol, and ethyl butanoate typically characterize the odor of black currants due to their high odor activity values. (Jung et al.). 4-Methoxy-2-methyl-2-butanthiol has a characteristic black currant like odor but is also ascribed as a catty urine smell in higher concentrations. It was neither detected by sensory evaluation nor by GC–MS measurements in the medium or the fermented cultures. This characteristic flavor compound of black currants is probably lost during autoclaving. (3Z)-Hexenal is known to be removed by freezing and was also not detected (Jung et al.). Odor impression 1 'mushroom' (Table 1) has the same odor and retention index as 1-octen-3-one. Because of its very low odor threshold (0.03 -1.12 ng L−1 air), the nose could be more sensitive than the MS detector (Guth and Grosch). Therefore, the odor impression could be explained by small amounts of 1-octen-3-one. 1,8-Cineol with its terpenic odor and ethyl butanoate with a pineapple-like odor were detected by GC–MS in the medium and the fermented beverage. During GC-O measurements, they were perceived less intensely than the compounds listed in Table 1. Overall, the beverage is characterized by a unique flavor composition, which can hardly be compared to the odor profile of fruit juices or other known beverages. The comparison with fermentations without pomace showed that the relative peak areas of the odor-active compounds differed from those of cultures without pomace (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Although the overall flavor impression does not resemble that of black currant, the pomace represents a rich source of nutrients to enable the formation of the flavor compounds by W. cocos."
TA041175_R_0004,"The broader applications and safety considerations of W. cocos fermentation are discussed. Previous studies have demonstrated its ability to produce diverse aroma compounds in various substrates, such as green tea and okara. The fungus's safety profile is supported by traditional use in Chinese medicine, though regulatory approval may be required in the EU. Oxalic acid levels in the beverage, while notable, are far below those in common foods like spinach or rhubarb. The study highlights the sustainability benefits of pomace upcycling, estimating that 3.6 L of beverage can be produced from 1 kg of berry pomace, reducing waste and resource use. The findings underscore the potential of fungal fermentation to transform agricultural byproducts into value-added products with high consumer appeal.","W. cocos has been used to ferment several substrates in the past, and some of the odor-active compounds detected in this study have also been reported previously. Sommer et al. fermented black currant pomace with W. cocos in solid-state fermentation. Supplementation of the solid-state cultures with sodium aspartate led to a wild-strawberry like odor. Linalool, geraniol, methyl anthranilate, and 2-aminobenzaldehyde were revealed to be key aroma compounds in recombination experiments. Rigling et al. fermented brewed green tea with W. cocos, and the odor of the beverage was described as jasmine-like. Besides methyl anthranilate, linalool, geraniol, 2-phenylethanol and methyl phenylacetate were detected as aroma-relevant. Wang et al. fermented okara with W. cocos, and the fungus successfully reduced the beany flavor and produced aroma compounds like 1-octen-3-ol, benzaldehyde, 2-undecanone, geraniol, linalool, and methyl phenylacetate (Wang et al.). Overall, the biotransformation properties of W. cocos revealed an enormous potential for the production of pleasant aromas. Various side streams of the juice industry may thus be upcycled to a wide range of fermented beverages. The sclerotium of W. cocos is a traditional tea ingredient in Chinese medicine. No acute or chronic toxicity was described for a dosage of 18 g sclerotium d−1 (Wang et al.). From the beverage developed in this study, the fungal mycelium is removed by filtration, and the beverage is pasteurized prior to consumption. In accordance with Regulation (EU) /2283, the produced beverage will probably be classified as a novel food, and is therefore subject to an approval procedure in the European Union. However, as no harmful effects have been described for W. cocos, the fungal fermentation is highly promising (Wang et al.). A potentially toxicologically relevant compound in the beverage is oxalic acid, which is suspected to cause kidney stones consisting of calcium oxalate (Noonan and Savage). Cell culture studies showed a correlation of oxalic acid concentration and reactive oxygen species (Moryama et al.). In a recent review, the interaction of calcium oxalate and renal epithelial cells in in vitro cell culture models has been discussed, and calcium oxalate has been reported to trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition and carcinogenic features in renal cells (Petrovic et al.; Peerapen et al.). A typical daily intake of approximately 220 mg oxalate has been reported in the literature (Crivelli et al.), however, the contribution of the oral intake of oxalic acid for the formation of kidney stones is not yet fully understood. The brown-rot fungus W. cocos is known to decrease the pH of the culture medium by producing oxalic acid (Espejo and Agosin). A concentration of 192 ± 2 mg L−1 oxalic acid was detected in the processed beverage. Other foods contain much higher amounts of oxalic acid. For instance, spinach contains 3200–12,600 mg kg−1 and the oxalic acid concentrations of rhubarb range from 2750 to13,360 mg kg−1 (Noonan and Savage). Rhubarb juice is also a popular drink, which contains approximately 3400 mg L−1 oxalic acid (Will and Dietrich). The oxalic acid concentration in rhubarb juice exceeds the concentration of the pomace based fermented beverage by a factor of 18. Regarding the oxalic acid concentration, the developed beverage seems to be suitable for occasional human consumption. The recycling of pomace for the production of a fermented beverage is highly sustainable and could reduce the need for classical spritzer and lemonades. As 29% of the berry mass remains as pomace, 3.6 L of the fermented beverage can be produced from the side streams of one kg berries. Therefore, resources may be saved as less cultivation area is needed, less product is burnt and a healthy and palatable diet is enabled (May and Guenther; Struck et al.)."
TA041175_C_0001,"The study explores the upcycling of black currant pomace, a byproduct of juice production, by fermenting it with the edible medicinal fungus Wolfiporia cocos to create a pleasant and potentially functional beverage. The pomace is rich in nutrients and secondary metabolites, making it an ideal substrate for fungal fermentation. The resulting beverage was highly rated by a trained panel for its flavor profile, which includes notes of honey, flowers, and berries, and its well-balanced taste. Key flavor compounds were identified, and the product received a high purchase intent score.","Title: Upcycling of black currant pomace for the production of a fermented beverage with Wolfiporia cocos. Abstract: Pomace as a side stream from black currant juice production is mostly discarded, even though it is rich in nutrients like protein, fiber, sugars, anthocyanins, polyphenols, and other secondary metabolites. Fungi from the division of Basidiomycota have a great enzymatic toolbox to recycle these complex mixtures of nutrients. In particular, the edible medicinal fungus Wolfiporia cocos has been described as a suitable biocatalyst to form pleasant aroma compounds in fermentation processes. Therefore, medium optimization, upscaling, and filtration were performed to produce a beverage based on black currant pomace fermented with W. cocos. A trained panel described the beverage as highly pleasant, reminiscent of honey, flowers and berries with a well-balanced sour and sweet taste. The flavor compounds linalool (citrus), geraniol (flowery), phenylacetic acid (honey), methyl phenylacetate (honey), eugenol (clove), and 2-phenylethanol (rose) were produced during fermentation and the concentrations exceeded their respective odor thresholds. The produced beverage was evaluated with 8.0 ± 1.4 from 10 for the question of whether panelists would buy the product. Fungal fermentation with the edible fungus W. cocos enabled the production of a highly pleasant beverage and additionally may reduce waste by using pomace and table sugar as sole ingredients.

The fermented beverage was described as highly tasty and has the potential to be easily scaled up. The substrate-fungus combination led to a pleasant, unique flavor profile. As the fungus is described as edible and known as a natural drug, it has a great potential not only as a biocatalyst for flavor and fruit acid formation, but also as a functional drink. Further research regarding the nutritional and potential health benefits could be highly interesting."
TA049934_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the medicinal significance of Panax ginseng and its ginsenosides, describing their classification, biosynthetic pathway, and the role of UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) in glycosylation, while emphasizing the limited characterization of UGTs and the use of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) to study ginsenoside biosynthesis.","Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer, Araliaceae) is a traditional medicinal herb that has been widely used in East Asia for thousands of years. Roots of P. ginseng and their extracts have been reported to exhibit many therapeutic properties, e.g., maintaining immune homeostasis, improving brain function, preventing cancer, and adjusting blood pressure. Some of the pharmacological activities of ginseng have been attributed to Panax-specific ginsenosides, major triterpenoidal saponin constituents of ginseng. Ginsenosides are classified into three subgroups based on their aglycone backbone structures: dammaranes, oleananes, and ocotillol triterpenes. P. ginseng ginsenosides are mainly of the dammarane-type, which are further classified as protopanaxadiol (PPD; ginsenoside Rb1, Rc, Rd, Rg3, Rh2, etc.) or protopanaxatriol (PPT; Re, Rg1, Rg2, Rh1, etc.), according to the number of hydroxyl groups. We previously revealed the putative biosynthetic pathway for dammarane-type ginsenosides. Briefly, dammarenediol II is generated from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) by condensation and cyclization reactions, and these are successively catalysed by farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), squalene synthase (SQS), squalene epoxidase (SQE), and dammarenediol II synthase (DDS). The aglycone ginsenoside metabolites PPD and PPT, are biosynthesized from dammarenediol II through hydroxylation by protopanaxadiol synthase (PgPPDS, CYP716A47) and protopanaxatriol synthase (PgPPTS, CYP716A53v2). Glycosylation of PPD and PPT produces a variety of ginsenosides. The glycosylation of triterpenoidal aglycones is catalysed by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) that use uridine diphosphate (UDP)-activated sugar molecules as sugar donors. More than 150 ginsenosides have been identified from Panax spp.. This diversity is attributed to many unique UGT-encoding genes. However, only a few UGTs have been characterized for their substrate specificity: PgUGT71A27 (UGTPg1; PPD to compound K), PgUGT74AE2 (PPD to ginsenoside Rh2 and compound K to ginsenoside F2, respectively), PgUGT94Q2 (ginsenoside Rh2 to Rg3, F2 to Rd, respectively), UGTPg101 (PPT to ginsenoside F1, and further to Rg1), and UGTPg100 (PPT to ginsenoside Rh1, and F1 to Rg1). Many other UGTs associated with ginsenoside biosynthesis remain unidentified. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is an important cellular regulator in plants, which is involved in seed germination, root growth, fertility, fruit ripening, senescence, and plant defence mechanisms. MeJA is an effective elicitor of ginsenoside biosynthesis in cultured cells and adventitious roots of P. ginseng. In our previous study, we applied integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics to investigate metabolism in MeJA-treated adventitious roots of various P. ginseng cultivars. Increased ginsenoside content corresponded with expression levels of candidate genes in the downstream ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway, including SQE and DDS; however, the dynamic regulatory mechanism for the final accumulation of ginsenoside, catalysed by UGTs, remains unknown. Our previous study revealed that, of three ginseng cultivars, adventitious roots of the CS cultivar produced the lowest level of ginsenosides and related gene expression. However, treating CS with MeJA dramatically increased the ginsenoside content and corresponding transcription levels of candidate genes. Therefore, we deduced that CS would be an appropriate cultivar in which to identify putative UGTs associated with ginsenoside biosynthesis in response to MeJA treatment. In this study, we used complementary transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches to investigate the UGT-catalysed biosynthesis of ginsenosides. Expression levels of UGT-related genes, and ginsenoside contents, were analysed in a time-dependent manner using MeJA-treated adventitious roots of P. ginseng, cultivar CS."
TA049934_M_0001,"The study involved culturing adventitious roots of Panax ginseng (Cheongsun cultivar) in bioreactors with Schenk and Hildebrandt liquid medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid and sucrose. The roots were treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) to induce ginsenoside biosynthesis. RNA was isolated from MeJA-treated roots at 12, 24, and 48 hours using the RNeasy Plant Kit. RNA-Seq libraries were constructed and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the data, including mapping reads to the ginseng gene set, identifying differentially expressed genes, and performing phylogenetic analysis.","Adventitious roots of P. ginseng (CS cultivar) were cultured as previously described and amplified in bioreactors containing 1 L Schenk and Hildebrandt liquid medium supplemented with 3 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid and 5% sucrose. Three grams of these fresh proliferated roots was transferred into 250-mL flasks containing the same medium supplemented with 200 µM MeJA and cultured at 23 ± 1 °C on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm under constant dark conditions. We selected 21 flasks containing healthy growing adventitious roots and harvested these with three replications for each condition: 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after initiation of MeJA treatment. Total RNA was isolated from MeJA-treated adventitious roots after 12, 24 and 48 h using the RNeasy Plant Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After examining its quality and quantity using a bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA), about 2 μg total RNA was used to independently construct RNA-Seq libraries with an insert size of 300 bp using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pooled libraries were sequenced with a paired-end read length of 150 bp using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform at LabGenomics Co. (Seongnam, Korea). Raw reads were deposited into the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequencing Read Archive. Accession numbers are provided in Table 1. Prior to differential gene expression analysis, reads containing bacterial contaminants were removed by mapping against available bacterial genomes using BWA. Adaptor contamination was then removed using the NGS QC Toolkit (v2.3.3). The current version of the ginseng gene set (IPGA_v1.1) was retrieved from the Ginseng Genome Database (https://ginsengdb.snu.ac.kr). Protein domains and motifs of UGT genes in P. ginseng were identified using InterProScan. Trimmed, high-quality RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the ginseng gene set to calculate fragments per kilobase per million (FPKM) using RSEM. The bioconductor package edgeR was used to identify differentially expressed genes in MeJA-treated samples. Genes exhibiting changes greater than two-fold with a significant false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.001 were considered differentially expressed."
TA049934_M_0002,"Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to validate RNA-Seq results using SYBR Green Power PCR Master Mix. Metabolomic profiling was conducted using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quad time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) to analyze ginsenosides in MeJA-treated roots. Samples were prepared by sonicating freeze-dried root powder in ethanol, followed by centrifugation and resuspension in methanol. UPLC separation was performed on a C18 column with a gradient mobile phase. Mass spectrometry data were processed using Mzmine2 software, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify metabolic changes.","Total RNA was isolated from the adventitious roots of P. ginseng cultivar CS treated with MeJA using the RNeasy Plant Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality and quantity was examined using formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized using 1 µg of RNA (Invitrogen, USA), and the cDNA was diluted to 1/10 for use in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Power PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the Roche Lightcycler 480 Realtime PCR system (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The thermal cycling conditions for PCR were: 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. qPCR was carried out in duplicate for each sample. The qPCR primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Twenty milligrams of freeze-dried sample powder was sonicated with 1 mL of 70% ethanol for 90 min at room temperature. Extracts were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 3 min, then 500 μL of each supernatant was dried using nitrogen gas and resuspended in 1 mL 50% methanol. Prepared samples were analyzed using a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters Co., Milford, MA, USA) coupled with a Waters Xevo G2 quad time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (Waters MS Technologies, Manchester, UK), which was equipped with an electrospray interface (ESI). Separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters Co.) column. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and acetonitrile (B) with the following gradient condition: 20% B (0–9 min); 20–30% B (9–14 min); 30% B (14–17 min); 30–32% B (17–21 min); 32–42.5% B (21–26 min); 42.5–90% B (26–30 min). The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.3 mL/min, and the column temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Analyses of the samples (1.0 μL injected into the partial loop in needle overfill mode) were performed in negative ion mode in the 100–1500 Da range, with acquisition times of 0.2 s in centroid mode. ESI conditions were set as follows: capillary voltage 3.5 kV, con voltage 45 V, source temperature 120 °C, desolvation temperature 300 °C, cone gas flow 50 L/h, and desolvation gas flow 800 L/h. High-purity nitrogen was used as the nebulizer and auxiliary gas, and argon was used as the collision gas. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using sodium formate over a range of 100–1500 Da; leucine enkephalin (m/z 554.2615 [M –H ]−) was used as the lockmass to ensure mass accuracy and reproducibility. To identify ginsenosides, collision-induced dissociation (CID) data were recorded using MSE methodology. Low collision energy to detect precursor ions was set to 4 eV, and the high collision energy for fragmentation was set to 40–45 eV. Mass spectrometry (MS) ion markers were extracted from liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) raw data using Mzmine2 2.30 software. Mass ion detection was performed with the noise level set to 2000, and based on the detected mass list, peak lists were built with criteria as follows: minimum time span of 0.02 min, minimum height of 3000, and m/z tolerance of 0.006 Da (or 10.0 ppm). Chromatographic deconvolution was achieved using the baseline cut-off algorithm (minimum peak height of 3000, peak duration range of 0.02–0.30 min, and baseline level of 1000). Chromatograms were de-isotoped using the isotopic peaks grouper algorithm with an m/z tolerance of 0.006 Da (or 10.0 ppm) and a tR tolerance of 0.1 min. Peak lists for samples were aligned together using the join aligner module (m/z tolerance at 0.006 Da or 20 ppm, absolute tR tolerance at 0.3 min, weight for m/z of 70, and weight for tR of 30), and the aligned peak list was eventually gap-filled with the peak finder module (intensity tolerance at 50%, m/z tolerance at 0.006 Da or 10.0 ppm, and absolute tR tolerance of 0.2 min). Peaks from MS contaminants were identified by blank injection, and duplicate peaks were manually removed from the aligned and gap-filled peak list. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using SIMCA 13.0 software (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden), with Pareto scaling of data."
TA049934_R_0001,"The study identified 226 UGT genes in Panax ginseng using the Ginseng Genome Database. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 11 UGT genes upregulated by MeJA treatment, all containing PSPG motifs. Three matched known UGT genes, while eight were novel. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these UGTs with known families involved in terpenoid and saponin glycosylation in other plants. qPCR validation confirmed RNA-Seq data for most genes, except one likely due to paralog interference.","Using the most recent version of the P. ginseng annotation available in the Ginseng Genome Database (http://ginsengdb.snu.ac.kr/), 226 UGT genes were identified. Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis revealed that 11 of these were up-regulated after treatment with MeJA. Furthermore, using Interpro PROSITE (ID: PS00375), all 11 of these UGT genes encoded plant secondary product glycosyltransferase (PSPG) motifs, which are believed to be involved in binding the UDP moiety to glycosylate plant secondary metabolites. Three of the 11 UGT genes (Pg_S4493.1, Pg_S4157.4, and Pg_S4174.7) matched with the previously characterized P. ginseng UGT-encoding genes KF377585.1 (PgUGT1), KM491309.1 (PgUGT71A27), and JX898529.1 (PgUGT74AE2) (Fig. 1). The remaining eight were considered novel UGT-encoding candidates. Phylogenetic analysis was then performed with the candidate UGTs and known UGT proteins from other plant species (Fig. 2). Intriguingly, the candidate UGTs could be placed into the same groups as previously characterized UGT proteins from other plant species. UGTs belonging to the UGT74 family in Arabidopsis thaliana and P. ginseng recognize substrates of glucosinolates and ginsenoside Rh2, respectively. Evidence that members of the UGT74 family are involved in terpenoid biosynthesis has been reported in A. thaliana and P. ginseng (PgUGT71A27). We identified three new UGT genes (Pg_S4174.7, Pg_S4174.10 and Pg_S2390.5) belonging to the UGT74 family, along with a previously known P. ginseng UGT (PgUGT74A1). Members of the UGT73 family are involved in saponin glycosylation in Siberian ginseng (Eleuthreococcus senticosus, Araliaceae), and other plants such as Barbarea vulgaris, Medicago truncatula, and Glycine max. Our analysis revealed that the UGT Pg_S2351.7 is related to the UGT73 family, suggesting a role for that UGT in glycosylation in P. ginseng. Similarly, the involvement of UGT94 and UGT91 family members in triterpene biosynthesis was previously found in P. ginseng (PgUGT94B1) and G. max (GmUGT91H4). Here, two novel UGT genes (Pg_S6708.3 and Pg_S0804.16) were grouped into the UGT94 family, and one (Pg_S5521.1) was grouped into the UGT91 family. To validate our RNA-Seq data, we randomly selected six genes for reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays (Fig. 3). The resulting expression patterns were consistent with RNA-Seq data, except for one gene, Pg_S4174.10. We assume that this one discrepancy might have occurred because RNA-Seq read mapping is limited by the presence of highly identical paralog (>95% identity) copies of Pg_S4174.10 in P. ginseng."
TA049934_R_0002,"Metabolomic analysis of MeJA-treated P. ginseng adventitious roots revealed dynamic changes in ginsenoside profiles. UPLC-QTOF-MS identified 21 major ginsenosides, with PPD-type ginsenosides (e.g., Rb1, Rc, Rb2, Rd, Rg3) showing significant MeJA-induced accumulation. PCA confirmed time-dependent increases, particularly for malonyl ginsenosides. Proposed biosynthetic pathways suggest UGTs mediate glycosylation steps, with malonylation implicating ginsenosides in plant defense.","Adventitious root tissues from P. ginseng were prepared after 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h of MeJA treatment, and ginsenosides in extracts of those tissues were analysed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography–quad time of flight–mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) in triplicate (Fig. 4). Twenty-one major ginsenoside peaks were observed in LC-MS chromatograms. By comparing retention times and characteristic collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragment ions with reference compounds, 12 major ginsenosides (Rg1, Re, Rf, Rg2, Rb1, Rc, Ro, Rb2, Rb3, Rd, Rg3, and F2) were unambiguously identified. Other peaks were tentatively assigned by comparing their empirical molecular formulae, CID fragmentation patterns, and relative retention times, with those of previously published data (Supplementary Table 1). The analytical method used in this study was similar to that we used previously, with some modifications to characterize a greater number of ginsenosides in a metabolomic profile. In particular, the peaks of two major ginsenosides, Re and Rg1, could be separated within a chromatogram. Base peak ion (BPI) chromatograms showed that the levels of most ginsenosides were dramatically increased following MeJA treatment, but some – Rg1 (1), Re (2), and Ro (8) –showed relatively constant amounts. Intensities of chromatographic peaks at tR 3–5 min were also significantly increased; however, these metabolites were not expected to be ginsenosides (expected molecular formula were C18H30O8 and C19H32O10) although they could not be identified precisely. For more detailed analysis of ginsenoside profiles, our LC-MS dataset was processed into a peak table including 156 ion markers using Mzmine 2 software. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed on the processed ginsenoside profile to visualize time-dependent metabolic differences. In the PCA score plot, it is easy to recognize the ginsenoside accumulation pattern by increasing principle component 1 (PC1) (Fig. 5A). Between 0 and 120 h of MeJA elicitation, the PC1 value showed a constant increase and accounted for 75.2% of the total variance in the dataset. The PCA loading plot indicates that most ginsenosides correlate positively with PC1, implying that the levels of almost every ginsenoside increased after MeJA elicitation. The ginsenosides Rb1 (5), Rc (7), Rb2 (10), and Rd (14), and malonyl ginsenosides Rb1 (6) and Rd (15) showed especially high positive correlations with PC1, suggesting that biosynthesis of these ginsenosides is significantly induced by MeJA (Fig. 5B). Time-dependent accumulation patterns of the major ginsenosides were compared based on the ion intensity of their LC-MS profiles. Fold-changed relative abundance according to time after MeJA treatment was calculated using the Mzmine peak ion table (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6, and as also found by Oh et al., the amounts of PPT-type and oleanane-type ginsenosides were not affected by MeJA treatment, while the levels of PPD-type ginsenosides significantly increased with MeJA treatment and most PPD-type ginsenosides started to accumulate after 48 h. Our previous study suggested that PPD-type ginsenosides are involved in defence mechanisms against biotic stresses, while PPT-types are involved in mechanisms against abiotic stresses. The ginsenosides Rg3, Rd, and Rb3 showed the most dramatic accumulation, with 106.3, 43.0, and 32.2-fold increases, respectively, after 120 h. Contents of the ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, and Rc also significantly increased, with 15.2, 14.2, and 17.9-fold changes, respectively. The accumulation patterns of the ginsenoside F2, compounds Mc1 and O, and gypenoside XVII suggested that they became saturated after 96 h. Malonylated ginsenosides, a group of derivatives that are compartmentalized in the vacuole, also increased in content, but these changes were relatively small compared with non-malonylated ginsenosides. Figure 7 shows the possible biosynthetic pathways of the PPD-type ginsenosides that significantly accumulated after MeJA treatment. These pathways are proposed based on their sugar moiety sequences. Of the compounds identified, several have two glucose residues at the C3-OH position, and there are two possible pathways for the biosynthesis of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3 and Rc (see red and blue lines in Fig. 7). The red pathway follows the route from ginsenoside Rg3 to ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, and Rc through ginsenoside Rd. Several different UGTs might be involved in this step by adding different glucose moieties, such as Glc, Xyl, Ara(p) and Ara(f). The blue pathway uses different substrates, but the reaction is the same: adding a glucose residue to 3-O-glucoside. In MeJA-treated adventitious roots of P. ginseng, the fold-changes of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, and Rc show similar patterns as in Fig. 6, implying that these compounds are produced by a single UGT, or are co-controlled by very similar UGTs. Therefore, we suggest that the biosynthesis of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, and Rc follows the blue pathway shown in Fig. 7. Malonylation is a common form of plant metabolism used to store toxic materials separately in vacuoles. The fact that ginsenosides undergo malonylation therefore provides evidence for the role of ginsenosides in defence. Malonylated ginsenosides significantly elicited by MeJA treatment in our study were Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, Rd, and gypenoside XVII. We therefore suggest that these ginsenosides are the metabolites related to plant defence in P. ginseng, and propose that the 11 UGTs – including eight novel UGTs – identified in this study may contribute to the glycosylation of these ginsenosides."

The putative biosynthetic pathway for ginsenoside biosynthesis is known in P. ginseng, as are some of the transcripts and enzyme-encoding genes. However, few genes related to the UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), enzymes that mediate glycosylation processes in final saponin biosynthesis, have been identified. Here, we generated three replicated Illumina RNA-Seq datasets from the adventitious roots of P. ginseng cultivar Cheongsun (CS) after 0, 12, 24, and 48 h of treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Using the same CS cultivar, metabolomic data were also generated at 0 h and every 12-24 h thereafter until 120 h of MeJA treatment. Differential gene expression, phylogenetic analysis, and metabolic profiling were used to identify candidate UGTs. Eleven candidate UGTs likely to be involved in ginsenoside glycosylation were identified. Eight of these were considered novel UGTs, newly identified in this study, and three were matched to previously characterized UGTs in P. ginseng. Phylogenetic analysis further asserted their association with ginsenoside biosynthesis. Additionally, metabolomic analysis revealed that the newly identified UGTs might be involved in the elongation of glycosyl chains of ginsenosides, especially of protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenosides."
TA049934_C_0002,"The discussion elaborates on the findings, highlighting the time-dependent changes in UGT-related gene expression and ginsenoside content in MeJA-treated P. ginseng roots. The study identified 11 candidate UGTs, including eight novel ones, with strong associations to ginsenoside biosynthesis. These UGTs are hypothesized to play a role in glycosyl chain elongation, particularly in PPD-type ginsenosides. Further functional studies are needed to confirm their specific substrates and roles in P. ginseng.","Discussion: We investigated time-dependent changes in UGT-related gene expression and ginsenoside content of MeJA-treated adventitious roots of the P. ginseng cultivar CS, which was previously shown to markedly increase ginsenoside biosynthesis upon treatment with MeJA. Transcriptomic analysis identified 11 candidate UGTs, including eight novel and three previously characterized UGTs. Metabolic profiling and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these candidate UGTs are strongly associated with ginsenoside biosynthesis. Furthermore, these newly identified UGTs might be related to steps involving the elongation of ginsenoside glycosyl chains, especially in PPD-type ginsenosides. Further functional characterization studies will elucidate the specific substrates of these UGTs in P. ginseng."
TA034736_I_0001,"Nanoencapsulation is increasingly used to enhance the stability and bioavailability of bioactive compounds in foods, including essential oils, by employing wall materials like gum arabic, maltodextrin, and casein to protect against environmental degradation.","Nanoencapsulation has found increasing interest due to the demand for healthy foods or foods with a minimum of chemical additives that allow to maintain the stability and availability of bioactive compounds. Therefore, the use of nanoencapsulation of phenolic compounds, antioxidants, food colorants, antimicrobial agents, essential oils, minerals, flavorings, and vitamins is being studied to maintain or improve the foods’ properties, such as their sensory and nutritional attributes. Natural essential oils (EOs) are a complex mixture of volatile compounds, mainly terpenes, terpenoids, and phenols distributed in different parts of plants, including the fruit peel, as is the case of citrus fruits. Citrus EOs contain monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, with the main component being D-limonene. This compound has various uses in the food industry, highlighting its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. However, the potential of citrus EOs is affected by external factors (temperature, UV radiation, pH) given their chemical nature (monoterpene hydrocarbons), limiting their shelf life during food processing or storage. Protecting EO compounds against this, and according to Hasani et al., is necessary. Given this, a physical barrier using the nanoencapsulation technique promises to prevent the degradation of EOs and their bioactive components. The use of nanoencapsulation in the food industry allows the controlled release of EOs, improving their bioavailability. Moreover, it prolongs the shelf life of EOs by reducing their interaction with the food matrix and preventing their degradation or volatilization during storage, preserving their physical and oxidative properties over time."
TA034736_I_0002,"Maltodextrin, gum arabic, and casein were selected as wall materials for nanoencapsulation due to their complementary properties, such as solubility, emulsification, and structural reinforcement, to enhance encapsulation efficiency and stability of essential oils, particularly D-limonene.","Nanoencapsulation employs wall materials in the encapsulants, such as maltodextrin (MD) and gum arabic (GA). However, Mahdi et al. and Moser et al. mention that employing a single wall material does not ensure the ability to encapsulate efficiently, making EOs unstable, leading to the need to use mixtures with other compounds such as proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, among others. On the other hand, it is also necessary to pay attention to the encapsulation methods such as drying and lyophilization, the latter being more efficient for separating nanoparticles by expelling water without altering their structure and shape. In this study, maltodextrin (MD), gum arabic (GA), and casein (CAS) were selected as wall materials due to their complementary properties that enhance the encapsulation efficiency and stability of essential oils. MD is a low-viscosity polysaccharide with excellent solubility and film-forming capacity, making it suitable for processes such as spray drying and lyophilization, as well as being affordable and tasteless. Gum arabic is a highly effective natural emulsifier due to its amphiphilic nature, stabilizing the oil–water interface and contributing to the controlled release of encapsulated compounds. Casein is a milk-derived protein that strengthens the structure of the capsules through its hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic properties, which help to ensure the stability of compounds such as D-limonene against adverse environmental factors. On the other hand, other materials such as sodium alginate, chitosan, gelatin, or vegetable proteins, although useful in some applications, have limitations such as high hydrophilicity, thermal sensitivity, or additional stabilization requirements that make them less suitable for this particular case. In this way, the combination of MD, GA, and casein provides a synergistic approach that improves the encapsulation, stability, and functionality of the essential oils."
TA034736_I_0003,"The study emphasizes the critical role of nanoencapsulation in preserving D-limonene from citrus essential oils by selecting optimal wall materials and techniques, ensuring controlled release and enhanced functional properties for food industry applications.","Given the importance of preserving key bioactive compounds such as D-limonene, the main component of citrus essential oils, the nanoencapsulation system is critical. The stability of D-limonene is often compromised due to its sensitivity to environmental factors such as oxidation and volatilization, which can lead to the loss of its functional and sensory properties. Therefore, in order to maximize the preservation of essential oil properties and functionality, the selection of suitable wall materials and nanoencapsulation techniques is critical. Nanoencapsulation protects the bioactive compounds of essential oils from external degradation and facilitates their controlled release. It also allows for controlled delivery of bioactive compounds, enhancing their functional properties. Nanoencapsulation offers advantages over other encapsulation techniques, such as liposomal encapsulation or cyclodextrin-based complexes, by being more scalable, cost-affordable, and versatile in terms of the types of materials that can be used as carriers. This makes nanoencapsulation a promising strategy to improve the shelf life and bioactivity of citrus essential oils, addressing the growing demand for natural and sustainable ingredients for the food industry. Therefore, this study evaluated the efficiency of nanoencapsulation with different wall material formulations to preserve D-limonene and their impact on the physicochemical properties of nanoencapsulated essential oils, providing valuable information for practical application."

Sweet lemon (Citrus limetta sp.) was obtained from the district of San Nicolás (6°23′45″ S, 77°28′56″ W, 1616 m.a.s.l.). All fruits in the trial were washed. The pulps were discarded, and the peels were cut into 1 cm2 pieces and stored separately in vacuum storage bags at 4 °C until use. Essential oils from citrus peels were extracted separately by steam distillation (Tecnal, TE-2761, Piracicaba, Brazil) for 1 h, at an extraction temperature of 80 °C. For this purpose, 300 g of peel in 500 mL of distilled water was used. After each extraction, an aqueous phase (aromatic water) and an organic phase (essential oil) were obtained and separated by decantation. The organic phase was stored at 2 °C until further use. The EO yield was calculated as described by Prommaban and Chaiyana using Equation (1). Prior to preparation of the nanoemulsions, combinations of encapsulating walls were formulated using maltodextrin, gum arabic, and casein. The formulations followed Karaaslan et al. because it provides antimicrobial activity and oxidative stability when employed in essential oils. The method described by Karaaslan et al. was applied considering a wall material ratio of 1/1 (w/w) and 1/1/1 (w/w/w). For this purpose, each encapsulating material was weighed according to the amount of essential oil to be encapsulated. Then, the wall materials were dissolved with 50 mL of ultrapure water for every 15 g solid material, and refrigerated at 5 °C for 12 h. Then, the wall materials were mixed with the essential oil (30% dry weight) and homogenized in a vortex. Finally, tween 80 (5% of the dry weight of the wall material) was added and homogenized for 3 min until emulsification. The EOs nanoemulsions were frozen at −79 °C for 24 h, then freeze-dried at 0.008 bar at −84 °C for 18 h. Subsequently, the material obtained was crushed in a mortar to form a homogeneous powder and placed in falcon tubes wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid light.

TA034736_C_0001,"The study evaluates the physicochemical properties of nanoencapsulated essential oils (EOs) from sweet lemon, mandarin, lime, and orange, using different wall material formulations (gum arabic, maltodextrin, and casein). Results indicate that GA/MD combinations enhance solubility, while GA/CAS and GA/MD/CAS improve phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. Encapsulation efficiency and D-limonene retention vary depending on the wall material and EO type, highlighting the importance of tailored formulations for stability and functionality.","Essential oils exhibit antioxidant properties but are prone to oxidative degradation under environmental conditions, making their preservation crucial. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the physicochemical properties of nanoencapsulated essential oils (EOs) extracted from the peel of sweet lemon, mandarin, lime, and orange using four formulations of wall materials consisting of gum arabic (GA), maltodextrin (MD), and casein (CAS).

TA034736_C_0002,"The discussion emphasizes the critical role of wall materials in stabilizing and preserving the functional properties of encapsulated EOs. Combinations like GA/MD/CAS and MD/CAS improve physical yield, moisture content, and bioactive retention. Casein-based formulations are particularly effective for phenolic conservation, while GA/MD enhances solubility and reduces hygroscopicity. The findings suggest that tailored wall material combinations can optimize EO stability for food and pharmaceutical applications.","The results highlight the importance of the wall material role in the stability and functional properties of encapsulated essential oils. The combination of wall materials not only influenced the physical yield and moisture content but also played a pivotal role in retaining bioactive compounds, such as phenols and D-limonene, which are essential for the its antioxidant and sensory properties. Moreover, the ability of gum arabic and casein to better conserve phenolic compounds was demonstrated. Also, the synergistic effects observed among maltodextrin, gum arabic, and casein combinations (GA/MD/CAS) underline the importance of using multi-component encapsulating systems for achieving optimal performance. These findings suggest that the strategic selection and combination of wall materials can be tailored to specific essential oils and their intended applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries, offering a versatile approach to enhancing product stability and functionality.The best physical yields were obtained with the mixture of maltodextrin plus casein (MD/CAS) as an encapsulating wall for essential oils of sweet lemon, lime, and orange. Furthermore, adding gum arabic (GA/MD/CAS) to this mixture resulted in nanoparticles with lower moisture content in the essential oil of sweet lemon. Low moisture content was also obtained when MD/CAS was used to encapsulate the essential oil of mandarin and lime and gum arabic plus casein (GA/CAS) for the essential oil of orange. When gum arabic and maltodextrin (GA/MD) were used as an encapsulant, the solubility of the four essential oils was increased, and the hygroscopicity of sweet lemon essential oil nanoparticles was reduced. Gum arabic and casein (GA/CAS) allowed the encapsulation of higher phenolic compounds from the essential oil of sweet lemon. However, when gum arabic was replaced by maltodextrin (MD/CAS), phenols from the essential oil of lime were better conserved. Additionally, formulations containing gum arabic and casein (GA/MD/CAS, GA/CAS) better conserved the essential oil of sweet lemon, mandarin, and orange.Encapsulation efficiency depends on the encapsulating wall material. Using gum arabic and maltodextrin (GA/MD) increased the encapsulation efficiency of lime EO. Similarly, it encapsulated more D-limonene from the essential oil of sweet lemon. On the other hand, the formulations with casein (MD/CAS, GA/CAS, and GA/MD/CAS) were the most efficient wall materials for retaining D-limonene from the EOs of mandarin, lime, and orange. Finally, it is confirmed that the encapsulant material depends on the type of essential oil and the physicochemical properties to be conserved."

Each fraction was tested on its anti-proliferative activity on Hep-G2 liver cancer cells by MTT assay. The phytochemical screening was carried out to identify the bioactive compound based on qualitative analysis. Results: The fraction 2 (F2) of C. nutans showed the lowest IC50 value of 1.73 μg/ml against Hep-G2 cancer cells, and it is identified as triterpenes. Conclusion: The fraction F2 identified as triterpenes isolated from C. nutans has potential as an anti-proliferative agent against liver cancer."
TA048815_R_0002,"The extraction and fractionation of C. nutans using hexane/ethyl acetate (7:3) resulted in four well-separated fractions (F1-F4) with distinct RF-values (0.34-0.93). Phytochemical screening identified carotenoids (F1), triterpenes (F2), cardiac glycosides (F3), and saponins (F4) as bioactive compounds. MTT assay revealed F2 (triterpenes) as the most potent fraction with an IC50 of 1.73 µg/mL, outperforming F3 (cardiac glycosides, IC50 = 4.51 µg/mL). Taxol, used as a standard, showed an IC50 of 0.11 µg/mL.","Result: C. nutans Extraction and Fractionation Table 1 presents the results for extraction and fractionation. The hexane/ethyl acetate at a ratio of 7:3 resulted in four separate spots on the TLC plate. For further separation by open column chromatography, ratio 7:3 has been chosen as mobile phase due to the suitable RF-value showing well-separated spots with RF-value from 0.34 to 0.93, polarity index of 1.86 suggested that there is a preeminent separation of the C. nutans extract. This is because it would be easier to collect the fractions during the open column chromatography analysis when the spots are not close to each other. For column chromatography, separated fractions were collected in 15 mL centrifuge tubes and were labeled with number 1 to 77 and proceed to vacuum concentrator. Again, TLC was used to monitor the effectiveness of the separation. Fractions with similar RF-value were group together. In this case, based on the RF-value, tube number 1 to 6 were group together and named as compound/fraction 1 (F1) (RF-value = 0.93), tube number 19-29 were fraction 2 (F2) (RF-value = 0.83), tube number 40-46 were fraction 3 (F3) (RF-value =0.59) and tube number 70-77 were fraction 4 (F4) (RF-value = 0.34). At this point, the four spots showed different RF-values because they might represent different compound, which at the same time having different polarity. Thus, phytochemical screening process takes part for further validation. Phytochemical screening of C. nutans fractions The compounds identified via phytochemical screening are tabulated in Table 2. They were evaluated based on colour formation, precipitate, froth formation, visibility of the ring formation between two layers and stain formation. The fractions revealed the presence of carotenoids (F1), triterpenes (F2), saponins (F4) and cardiac glycosides (F3) (Table 2) as secondary metabolites that might be responsible for the anti-proliferative activity of the cells. Phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, fixed oils, and fats were not detected in the fractions. IC 50 of C. nutans Fractions by MTT Assay This assay was carried out to identify the active fraction which has the anti-cancer activity and determine its IC50. In this experiment, Hep-G2 cells were treated with all four active fractions (F1 – F4) and taxol used as a standard at eight concentration intervals, ranging from 0.781 to 100 µg/mL and 0.0156 to 2 µg/mL, respectively. The active fraction that is capable of inhibiting the cells growth can be assumed to be useful in the treatment of liver cancer.For screening purpose, the percentage of cell death of all active fractions were plotted in a bar graph at the same concentration (1.56 µg/mL), and taxol at 2 µg/mL. Referring to Figure 1, among all those four fractions at concentration 1.56 µg/mL, active fraction 3 (F3) which is also preliminarily identified as cardiac-glycosides (Table 2) demonstrated the highest percentage of Hep-G2 cell death with 47.6 %.The data for the MTT assay were plotted in the graph of percentage of viable cells versus concentration (µg/mL) to identify the IC50 of each fraction and taxol. The result (Table 3) showed that F2 gave the lowest IC50 value (1.73 µg/ml), while F3 gave the IC50 of 4.51 µg/ml. The results suggesting that F2 is more potent than F3. When treated with adherent Hep-G2 cells, taxol gave the IC50 value of 0.11 µg/mL. Thus, active fraction F2 is considered to demonstrate a good result in this experiment."

Abstract: Problem statement: Clinicanthus nutans has been used by Malaysian since long time ago. It is used to treat many diseases including cancer. Many studies carried out on its crude extract but no clear report on the specific secondary metabolites responsible for its nature in treating selected diseases. Objective: This study aims to confirm the practice carried out by many people on the usage of Clinicanthus nutans in treating cancer. Methods: C. nutans leaves were extracted by methanol. Thin layer chromatography was used to identify the suitable solvent for fractions separation. The fractions were then separated at larger volume using gravity column chromatography. Each fraction was tested on its anti-proliferative activity on Hep-G2 liver cancer cells by MTT assay. The phytochemical screening was carried out to identify the bioactive compound based on qualitative analysis.

Conclusion: The fraction F2 identified as triterpenes isolated from C. nutans has potential as an anti-proliferative agent against liver cancer. ================= Discussion: RF-value is equal to the distance traveled by the substance divided by the distance traveled by the solvent. Typically, an effective solvent is one that gives RF- value in the range of 0.5-1.0 (Touchstone, 1992). It is also reported that the solvent system with the highest polarity will make the components in the mixture move along with the solvent and caused no separation observed and the RF-value will be too large. Thus, from the results in Table 1, the solvent system of hexane : ethyl acetate with ratio 7 : 3, polarity index value of 1.83 which gave the best readings of RF-values, ranging from 0.34 to 0.93 had been selected for further use in column chromatography. Later, column chromatography (CC) was used to collect the active fractions from crude of C. nutans leaves extract by gravity force. CC applied the same principles as TLC but performed at larger volume (Chik et al., 2011; Tolar and Neglia, 2003). Subsequently, phytochemical screening of the collected four active fractions was carried out to preliminary identify the type of secondary metabolites separated and isolated by CC. According to Table 2, terpenoids were isolated and collected in this experiment. This finding was supported by (Wan Chik et al., 2010; Çitoğlu and Acıkara, 2012), because of ethanol, methanol, and water led to the extraction of highly oxygenated namely polar triterpenes as well as triterpenoid and sterol glycosides. Besides, Tsado et al., (2016) used the same method and successfully extracted terpenoids from Newbouldia laevis and Crateva adansonii leaves using methanol as a solvent. Secondly, based on the phytochemical screening result (Table 2) shows that the presence of carotenoid in F1, triterpenes in F2, saponin in F3 and cardiac glycosides in F4. Referring to (Yamunadevi et al., 2011; Harborne, 1998), the combination of hexane: ethyl acetate is commonly used as the mobile phase to isolate and purify terpenoids group. Yamunadevi and co-workers (Yamunadevi et al., 2011) reported that 27 different types of terpenoids were detected by HPLTC, with RF- value range of 0.31 to 0.97. This information supports our current findings, which high possibility that the F2 is in terpenoids group."
TA048815_D_0002,"The discussion continues by highlighting the significance of terpenoids as natural substances with increasing pharmaceutical interest. It details the properties and applications of terpenoids, including their use in traditional medicine and their potential as anticancer agents. The MTT assay results are discussed, showing the effectiveness of F2 in inhibiting Hep-G2 cells. The study concludes that triterpenoids from C. nutans exhibit promising anti-proliferative effects on liver cancer cells, supporting its potential as an alternative treatment.","The current study shows the interest of valuable natural substance, such as terpenoids has been increasing day by day (Yamunadevi et al., 2011). Terpenoids are defined as secondary metabolites with molecular structures containing carbon backbones made up of isoprene (2-methylbuta- 1, 3-diene) units (Harborne, 1998). More than 36 000 terpenoids compounds have been identified, making terpenoids the largest class of plant metabolites. In particular, terpenoids contained in many herbal plants, with several kinds of terpenoids are already available for pharmaceutical applications today, such as taxol and artemisinin as a chemotherapy drug and malaria medicines, respectively (Yamunadevi et al., 2011). Generally, plant terpenoids are well-known to possess useful aromatic qualities (Harborne, 1998). It has been used traditionally in herbal remedies and still under investigation of the pharmaceutical function, such as antibacterial, anticancer and other therapeutic properties. Until now, there is no such study which carried out specifically on terpenoids isolated from C. nutans leaves extracted as an anticancer agent. However, the crude extract of this plant shows their anticancer properties. Fong (2015) reported that the methanol and water extracts of C. nutans leaves were cytotoxic against D24 and MM418C1 melanoma cells, MCF-7 and BT474 breast carcinoma cells. Other pharmacology properties of crude C. nutans leaves extract such as antioxidant activity, anti-proliferative activity, anti-tumour, and cytotoxic agents. This suggests that the extracts may contain the anti-cancer compound. Based on these results, terpenoids may be considered as a promising anticancer agent present in the C. nutans leaves extracts. The cytotoxicity of the fractions were further defined by determining the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The four active fractions from C. nutans leave extract were used from this experiment onwards. Initial yellow in colour of MTT assay is reduced to purple formazan in the mitochondria of living cells. The reduction will take place only when the mitochondrial reductase enzyme is active. Therefore, the conversion can be directly related to the number of viable/living cells. Through this experiment, the effectiveness of the sample in causing death to the cells can be measured by the amount of purple formazan produced after the sample treated with active fractions or taxol compared to the amounts of untreated cells (Freshney, 2010). Among all the four active fractions of C. nutans leaves extract, F3 showed the highest percentage of Hep-G2 cells death (47.6 %) at 1.56 µg/mL, while taxol gave 76.6 % at concentration 2 µg/mL. However, active fraction F2 exhibited the highest percentage of Hep-G2 cancer cells inhibition in almost every concentration tested (4 over 6 concentration tested; 1.56, 3.13, 6.25 and 25 µg/ml) than other active fractions. Later, the MTT assay results on adherent Hep-G2 cells (Figure 1) shows that F2 gave a reasonable and exceptional effect against Hep-G2 liver cancer cells because the value of F2 IC50 is in the acceptable range of suitable as cytotoxicity agent. According to the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) plant screening program, plant extract is generally considered to have in vitro cytotoxicity activity if the IC50 value is less than 20 µg/mL (Boik, 2001). The F2 fraction gave an IC50 value higher than taxol but still lesser than 20 µg/mL, supporting a milder effect of native-based product compared to highly, toxic taxol. Several papers on C. nutans leaves extract showed that the crude extract possesses potential anticancer agents towards cultured cancer cell lines such as HeLa and K-562 cells (Arullappan et al., 2014) and Raji lymphoma cells (Yong et al., 2013) but those studies did not identify the type of secondary metabolites responsible for the anti-cancer activity. While, from a phytochemical screening test of this study, an isolated active fraction from crude C. nutans leaves extract, F2 showed positive results towards Lieberman-Burchard reagent, indicated that this compound possibly triterpenoid. Triterpenoid is a well-known secondary metabolite compound that possesses such anticancer properties. Triterpenoid derived from avocado showed a positive result on Hep-G2 liver cancer cells, suggesting the in vitro cytotoxicity of triterpenoid (Abubakar et al., 2017). The same study also reported that triterpenoid was also safe to normal Vero cells (Abubakar et al., 2017). Many triterpenoids have various biological activities, e.g., anti-tumour, anti-viral, anti-bacterial, virostatic, anti-ulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory (Dzubak et al., 2006). Triterpenoids are used for medicinal purposes in many Asian countries for anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, hepatoprotective, cardiotonic, sedative and tonic effects (Moses et al., 2014). An increasing number of triterpenoids have been reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against a variety of in vitro cancer cells (MCF-7 breast cancer cells, Hep-G2 liver cancer cells) without manifesting any toxicity in normal cells (Vero cells) ( Moses et al., 2014). In conclusion, the triterpenoids isolated from C. nutans were able to show the positive anti-proliferative effect on Hep-G2 liver cancer cells. Thus, C. nutans is a potential alternative or complementary medicine for treating liver cancer in a human."
TA048769_I_0001,"Natural products, particularly plant-derived compounds like sesquiterpenes, have significant anticancer potential, with matricine being investigated for its effects on gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells.","Natural products have played an important role in curbing the incidence of cancer throughout the world. About half of the currently known anticancer drugs are derived from natural resources. Drugs such as podophyllotoxin and Taxol are natural products and are currently used in the treatment of devastating cancers. Most anticancer drugs of natural origin come from plants. Plants are always exposed to extremes of the environmental stresses and can’t walk away from them. In response to the environmental stress and have evolved to cope with extreme conditions by synthesizing a wide diversity of chemical scaffolds, often referred to as secondary metabolites. Although plant extracts were initially directly used for the treatment of ailments, with the advances in science and technology, the pure compounds isolated from plants are being used in the treatment of diseases as deadly as cancer. Based on the structure of these chemical entities, they have been classified into different groups. Sesquiterpene is one such group of metabolites that is ubiquitously found across the plant kingdom and have been shown to exhibit promising bioactivities. Sesquiterpenes from several plants have shown the capacity to inhibit the proliferation of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and gastric cancer.In the present study we assessed the effects of matricine, a naturally occurring sesquiterpene of plant origin, against gemcitabine-resistant Capan-2 human pancreatic carcinoma cells and non-cancerous hTRET-HPNE pancreatic cells. Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers. In China and the United States, it is ranked as the seventh and fourth major causes of cancer related deaths, respectively. It has been reported that pancreatic cancer affects 2.5 million people in the United States alone. The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is the worst among all cancers. Chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer has a number of adverse effects, and pancreatic cancer cells easily develop drug resistance, making it even more difficult to manage. Moreover, pancreatic cancer frequently relapses and may also become drug resistant, making it difficult to manage. Herein, we for the first time report the anticancer effects of matricine against capan-2 gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic carcinoma cells. The results showed that matricine inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer via induction of mitochondrial apoptosis and suppresses cell migration and invasion. Therefore, matricine may prove beneficial in the development of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer."

Apoptosis was evaluated through DAPI, AO/EB, and annexin V/PI staining, followed by fluorescent microscopy. Migration and invasion capabilities of Capan-2 cells were examined using Transwell chambers coated with extracellular matrix gel, with subsequent fixation, staining, and microscopic counting.

Briefly, at around 70% confluence, the Capan-2 and the hTRET-HPNE cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with 0–640 μM of matricine. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were incubated with MTT for 4 h. After this, the medium was removed and the colored formazan product was solubilized by 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. The viability of the capan-2 and the hTRET-HPNE cells was then determined by measuring absorbance at 570 nm. The Capan-2 cells were grown in 6-well plates (0.6×106 cells/well) and incubated for 12 h. The Capan-2 cells were subjected to matricine treatment at various levels (0, 10, 20, and 40 μM) for 24 h at 37°C. As the cells sloughed off, 25 μl cell cultures were put onto glass slides and stained with DAPI or a solution of AO and EB. The slides were then covered with a cover slips and examined with a fluorescent microscope (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The annexin V/PI staining was then performed as previously described. The migration and invasion abilities of Capan-2 cells were examined by Transwell chamber assay. In brief, 1×104 Capan-2 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of the Transwell device (8-μm pore size polycarbonate filters) and treated with a 20-μM concentration of matricine. This was followed by transfer into 24-well plates and incubation at 37°C for 48 h. For the invasion assay, the inserts were coated with extracellular matrix gel (50 μl) (ECM, Sigma, USA). Swabbing was performed to remove the non-migrated and non-invaded cells from the upper surface, while the migrated and invaded cells on the lower surface were subjected to fixation with methanol for about 35 min, followed by staining with crystal violet (0.5%) for about 50 min, then subjected to washing with PBS and finally counted under a light microscope (5 fields). The Capan-2 cells were harvested and subjected to washing with ice-cold PBS. The pellets were then suspended in lysis buffer at 4°C and then incubated at 95°C. Thereafter, the protein content of each cell extract was checked by Bradford assay. About 40 μg of protein was loaded from each sample and separated by SDS-PAGE before being shifted to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were then subjected to treatment with TBS and exposed to primary antibodies at 4°C. Thereafter, the cells were treated with appropriate secondary antibodies and the proteins of interest were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. The experiments were performed in triplicate and data are shown as mean ±SD. Statistical analysis was done using the t test with GraphPad prism 7 software.

On the other hand, the effects of matricine on proliferation of TRET-HPNE cells were negligible. The IC50 of matricine against the normal hTRET-HPNE cells was 80 μM (Figure 1C). Apoptosis in matricine-treated Capan-2 cells was determined by DAPI staining. It was quite evident from DAPI staining that the percentage of apoptotic cells increased with increase in the concentration of matricine (Figure 2). Moreover, AO/EB staining showed that the red fluorescent Capan-2 cells increased upon treatment with matricine, indicative of apoptosis (Figure 3). The annexin V/PI staining of the matricine-treated cells showed that the apoptotic Capan-2 cells increased from 1.2% in control to 48.4% at 40 μM of matricine (Figure 4). The apoptosis of the matricine-treated Capan-2 cells was further validated by examining the levels of apoptosis-related proteins by Western blot analysis, showing that matricine activated caspase-3 and -9 expression in a concentration-dependent manner.

TA037589_I_0001,"Marine sponges, particularly Dysidea avara, produce bioactive secondary metabolites like avarol and avarone, which have significant pharmaceutical potential, but supply challenges necessitate optimized in situ aquaculture methods.","Since the beginnings of the marine chemical ecology in the 1940s sponges turned out to be interesting organisms to study for commercial applications. Sponges contain secondary metabolites, which play important ecological roles in nature such as deterring fish from predation or inhibiting settlement and growth of foulants and have been shown to have biomedical properties. Many secondary metabolites from sponges have been reported to inhibit cellular growth and are therefore interesting natural products for obtaining new drugs against cancer. Lately, new pharmacological properties of sponge secondary metabolites have been discovered, such as their capacity to inhibit the nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB), which is one of the principal inducible transcriptional factors that plays a critical role in cancer development and in inflammation (see Folmer, for a review on NF-κB inhibitors). This recent discovering makes sponges, even more interesting targets in the drug discovery field than previously thought.The sponge Dysidea avara produces the sesquiterpene hydroquinone avarol and its corresponding quinone avarone. These secondary metabolites are cytostatic agents with potent anti-leukemic, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory activities. Recently, the NF-κB inhibitor activity of avarol has been described and might have an essential function in these observed anti-viral and anti-cancer activities. Moreover, avarol presents a moderate antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, and anti-fungal activities against a limited range of microorganisms. Furthermore, it inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and also is the main component (e.g., 60–98 wt.%) of a skin cream for treating psoriasis.Unfortunately, enormous quantities of avarol, higher than what can be found in the natural sponge populations, are necessary for its pharmaceutical applications. To overcome this supply problem, different approaches have been assayed. The biomedical potential of Dysidea avara has generated a wide variety of studies about different culture techniques based on this sponge species. Attempts to establish cell cultures of D. avara have also been performed based on both cell suspensions and cell aggregates (primmorphs). Another original ex situ method, which showed high survival and growth rates, was to grow sponge juveniles from larvae. Although the results obtained until now are encouraging, more investigation is required to make the ex situ culture methods a real possibility to produce the secondary metabolites in sufficient quantities to meet the market needs. On the other hand, the private enterprise KliniPharm GmbH is culturing D. avara in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea by holding explants on ropes to obtain avarol for the market (http://www.klinipharm.com). However, only few growth data of those farmed explants have been published. Although at present the most reliable method to culture sponges is in situ aquaculture more studies are required to optimize the whole process."
TA037589_I_0002,"Three in situ culture methods (rope, cage, and glue) were tested for Dysidea avara, focusing on survival, growth, and bioactivity, to address the challenges of farming sponges with fragile skeletons.","Sponge aquaculture was originally based on the practice to culture bath sponges (i.e., genera Coscinoderma, Hippospongia and Spongia) by holding sponge cuttings on ropes. Bath sponges have a keratose skeleton made of a network of spongine fibres providing them with a consistent structure. When culturing other sponge species that have less structural elements with a less resistant skeleton it is more appropriate to use meshes instead of ropes.In this study three different in situ experimental culture methods for growing Dysidea avara (Schmidt, 1862) have been tested in order to select the best one to be applied in large-scale aquaculture. D. avara is a softer sponge with a more fragile skeleton in comparison to bath sponges. We have cut explants and hold them on horizontal ropes, placed them in individual cages, and glued them to horizontal substrates, respectively. As a control, we also monitored growth and survival of untouched individuals in the same experimental zone. The success of the culture technique was not only evaluated by survival and growth of the sponges but also by evaluating the production of the target metabolite (bioactivity). The secondary metabolite production can vary due to both external and internal factors and farming structures used to support sponges can affect their metabolite production. Thus, survival, growth, and bioactivity of D. avara explants have been monitored along the year in the three above mentioned culture methods."
TA037589_M_0001,"The study was conducted in the western Mediterranean Sea at l’Escala, Spain, focusing on the aquaculture of the sponge Dysidea avara. A total of 75 large sponges were selected as donors, and fragments of approximately 28 cm³ were cut from each. These explants were subjected to three different culture methods: hanging from ropes, placing inside perforated cages, or attaching with non-toxic glue to rigid frames. The study began in winter to favor survival during the critical attachment period. Explants were monitored monthly for survival and at six and ten months for growth, using underwater photography and image analysis. Bioactivity was assessed at the end of the ten-month culture period using the Microtox® method to measure toxicity, which correlates with avarol production.","The study was carried out in the western Mediterranean Sea at the locality of l’Escala, North-East of Spain (GPS coordinates: 42° 06.863’N, 003° 10.116’E) from 5 to 20 m of depth on a rocky bottom. This area was selected because of the abundance of Dysidea avara, what is an indicator of the good conditions of this area for the sponge culture. A total of 75 large Dysidea avara, from 500 to 2,000 cm3 in size, living at 12–14 m of depth, were targeted as donor individuals. From them, a sponge fragment, c.a. 28 cm3 in size, was cut from each donor without removing the donor from its substrate. In order to minimize manipulation, the explants were submitted to the three experimental treatments (N = 25), immediately after collection, which consisted in i) to hang the sponges from ropes, ii) to place them within perforated cages or iii) to attach the sponges by glue on rigid frames (50 × 50 cm). All the treatments were placed 8 m deep in close proximity to a D. avara natural population. The rope method used in this study is similar to that already used by other authors, where a rope was inserted in a large needle and carefully passed through the sponge tissue. The ropes with the explants where placed horizontally, anchored to the rigid frames (Figure 1A). In the second method we placed each explant inside a 6 × 6 × 5 cm cage. The cages were made of a rigid 1 cm mesh size, plastic net to ensure seawater flow through the cages (Figure 1B). The third method consisted of gluing the explants to a horizontal steel frame with a non-toxic, two components resin (IVEGOR) (Figure 1C). Cages, frames and ropes were all placed at a distance of 40 cm from the sea bottom. The study started in winter when the seawater low temperature favours survival during the critical period of explant attachment. The cultured explants and the controls where monitored once a month for survival and at months six and ten for growth, during ten months, taking underwater pictures of each individual. Explant survival, recovery from eventual damage, and growth were estimated from the pictures. The cage cover was opened before taking pictures of the explants cultured inside cages. Bioactivity was only analysed at the end of the culture."
TA037589_M_0002,"Growth was measured by calculating the increase in volume of explants using image analysis. The projected area and mean height of each explant were derived from underwater photographs, and growth rates were calculated as the percentage of volume increase at six and ten months compared to the initial volume. Bioactivity was quantified using the Microtox® method, which measures the toxicity of sponge extracts by observing the decrease in bioluminescence of Photobacterium phosphoreum. The EC50 value, indicating the concentration causing a 50% reduction in light output, was used as a measure of toxicity. Statistical analyses included life tables for survival, the Gehan-Wilcoxon test for size-class comparisons, the Kruskal-Wallis test for growth rate differences, and one-way ANOVA for toxicity differences.","Growth was measured as the increase in volume (V) of explants. The size of each explant was calculated by multiplying its projected area by its mean height. The mean height was computed as the average of 5 measurements (taking into account also digitations). The sponge projected area and the mean height was derived from pictures by using image analysis (NIH Image program). Growth rates at six and ten months of culture (V6 or 10) were calculated as the percentage of the volume at month “6” and “10” with respect to the explant initial volume (V0). The error associated with the method used to calculate the explant growth prevents us from considering it as the real growth of Dysidea avara. However, the measurements can safely be used for comparison among the three culture techniques. The donor individuals (manipulation control) were not measured as for growth rates because of their much more complex shape with respect to that of the explants, which makes comparisons useless. To quantify the natural toxicity of the samples we used the Microtox® (Microbics, Carlsbad, CA, USA), a standardised method previously described. This method measures light production by the bioluminescent bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum, and detects bioluminescence decreasing when the bacteria are put in contact with the crude extracts of D. avara. Previous studies have reported an accurate positive relationship between concentration of avarol and Microtox-measured toxicity. At the end of the culture (ten months), the explants from the treatments and the control were taken to the laboratory. The samples were freeze-dried. An amount of 0.25 g of sample was squeezed in a mortar and extracted with dicloromethanol/methanol (1:1). Once the solvent was evaporated, the crude extract was weighed and resuspended through sonication in artificial seawater for the toxicity analyses by Microtox®. Toxicity was assayed at an initial concentration of 5 mg/mL of sponge dry weight. In every assay, a control and four decreasing concentrations (with a dilution factor of two) were tested after incubation of 5 min at 15 °C (temperature at which bacteria are active and produce bioluminescence). With these measures, a regression analysis on log/log scale between concentrations of crude extract and output of light was recorded. The EC50 value indicated in the regression equation is the concentration of crude extract that produces 50% in light decrease, which is assumed to represent the death of 50% of phosphorescent bacteria. The value 100/EC50 was calculated for each sample and used as measurement of toxicity. Survival was analyzed using the “life tables” statistics. Significant differences between size-classes were assessed by “Comparing Survival in Multiple Groups”. Then, comparison between each pair of size-classes was performed using the Gehan-Wilcoxon test. Mean growth rates after six and ten months were analysed by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test because data did not comply with the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions required for parametric analyses. Differences in toxicity between specimens cultured under the three culture methods and wild specimens were analysed by One-way ANOVAs after checking the data for accomplishment of the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions (Statistica 6.0 package)."
TA037589_R_0001,"The study explores in situ aquaculture methods for the sponge Dysidea avara, which produces the bioactive compound avarol. Three methods were tested: horizontal ropes, cages, and glue. Survival rates varied significantly, with cages showing the highest survival (70%), glue intermediate (40%), and ropes the lowest (11%). Growth rates also differed, with glued explants showing the highest growth after ten months (468.9%), while cages and ropes had similar growth rates (142.34% and 145.25%, respectively). Toxicity levels were highest in rope-cultured explants and lowest in cage-cultured ones.","Survival of explants was significantly different in the three culture methods used (p < 0.05, comparing survival in multiple groups (Figure 2). At the end of the culture (10 months), the explants placed in cages presented the highest survival (ca. 70% after 10 months of culture). The glued explants had an intermediate survival (ca. 40%), and the explants hold in ropes showed the lowest survival rates (11%). It is important to remark that for the explants hold in ropes the first month of culture was critical. After ten days the explants on ropes were reduced to a half, and at day 30, explant survival had already decreased to 38%. The mortality of the explants glued to the frame and hanged from ropes was mainly due to specimen losses because of the high water turbulence. In contrast, the cage method avoided individual removing and probably enhanced protection against predators. All the specimens of Dysidea avara used to obtain the explants (donors) survived until the end of the monitoring (ten months) and appeared healthy. Although positive growth rates were registered at the end of the culture (after ten months), growth rates varied depending on the method tested (Figure 3). After six months of culture, there were no significant differences among the three culture methods (p > 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test); however the explants cultured on ropes presented the lowest mean growth rate (ca. 40%), while the explants cultured in cages or glued to the frame presented similarly high growth rates (166.75 ± 34.62% and 167.23 ± 42.7; mean ± standard error, respectively). The explants placed in cages attached to the plastic net quite fast and after some weeks some of them grew out of the cage (Figure 4). At the end of the culture (ten months), significant differences between the three tested culture methods were found (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test). It is remarkable that the explants glued on the frame have increased notably in size, reaching the highest mean growth rates (468.9 ± 83.72%), while the explants cultured inside cages maintained the mean growth rate (142.34 ± 30.47%) monitored after six months of culture. On the other hand, the explants cultured on ropes, for which the lowest growth rates were recorded at month six, have grown notably after month ten (145.25 ± 79.06%), equalling the growth rate of the explants cultured in cages. At the end of the experiment, the explant toxicity was significantly different in the three experimental cultures (p < 0.05, One-way ANOVA; Figure 5). The explants growing in cages presented the lowest toxicity, while the ones hanging from ropes showed the highest toxicity (p < 0.05, Fisher LSD post hoc test). The explants glued to the frame presented similar toxicity to the control specimens (p > 0.05, Fisher LSD post hoc test)."
TA037589_D_0001,"The study explores in situ aquaculture methods for the sponge Dysidea avara, which produces the bioactive compound avarol. Traditional rope-based methods are unsuitable due to the sponge's soft consistency, so alternative methods (cages, glue, and ropes) were tested. Survival, growth, and bioactivity were evaluated. Cages showed the highest survival, glue the best growth, and ropes the highest bioactivity. The discussion highlights factors influencing these outcomes, including water flow, attachment success, and sponge physiology.","Dysidea avara explants cultured in cages showed the highest survival along the whole experiment probably due to the combination of several factors: (1) the relative low manipulation of those explants; (2) the impossibility of losing explants from the cages, and (3) the physical protection against potential predators. In particular, the cages avoided the high mortality due to individual losses, which occurs during the critical phase of attachment (first weeks of culture). The severity of this period depends on the species capability for attaching to the new substrate (e.g., cage, rope, and resin) and can be enhanced by a high level of sponge manipulation. Conversely, the sponges cultured on ropes presented a high mortality (ca. 70%) during the first 30 days because they show a particular difficulty to attach to the rope. On the other hand, the glued explants experienced an intermediate level of manipulation (less than the rope cultured explants and more than the ones placed in cages) what probably explains their middle mortality rates.We observed that the high water flow present in our study area, although suitable for the sponge growth, becomes a critical factor for survival of explants on ropes due to substrate instability and the associated reduction in attachment success. In our study area (8 m of depth) the water flow ranges from 0.05 to 0.15 m/s, and occasionally peacks to 0.66 m/s. These water flow conditions are comparable to the ones described by Duckworth and Battershill in an exposed site (from 0.19 to 46 m/s) where two sponge species (Polymastia croceus and Latrunculia wellingtonensis) where cultured by several different methods at 12 m deep. Duckworth and Battershill (2003) also found that strong water movement tore some explants off the rope, leading to survival rates of 59% and 22%, after nine months of culture for P. croceus and L. wellingtonensis, respectively. Moreover, explants cultured in cages at the end of the experiment (ten months) had survival rates (ca. 77%) comparable to those after nine months of P. croceus and L. wellingtonensis, cultured in mesh (96% and 61%, respectively).Survival rates depend on the species features. It has been speculated that the spongine contents of the sponge tissue plays an important role in the capability of regeneration and potential attachment of the target sponge; conversely the sponges with spicule skeletons and low collagen content have less capability to recover from manipulation and have more difficulties for attaching to the new substrate. Dysidea avara is a relatively elastic sponge but has not as much spongine as bath sponges (e.g., Spongia officinalis), what makes alternative culture methods as cages or glue, more suitable (higher survival) than ropes for the farmers."
TA037589_D_0002,"Growth and bioactivity results for Dysidea avara explants varied by culture method. Glued explants showed the highest growth, likely due to reduced stress and better attachment. Caged explants had low growth, possibly due to limited substrate and fouling. Rope-cultured explants exhibited the highest bioactivity, potentially due to stress-induced metabolite production. The glue method is recommended for metabolite production, but further research on environmental factors is needed.","As for explant growth, gluing the explants to horizontal solid substrates such a metallic frame seemed to be the best method to culture Dysidea avara in the sea. At the end of the experiment (ten months) the explants glued to the substrate had the largest final size. This huge growth rate, which can be considered high when compared with that of other cultured sponges (Table 3 in), has to be taken with care because of the method used for growth measuring. The high growth recorded may be a consequence of the non-invasive nature of the gluing method and the lower stress it produced to the sponges, compared with cages and ropes. Moreover, the glue provides a new artificial substrate, which seems to be suitable for a faster and easy attachment of the explants.The caged sponges, despite the low manipulation they suffered, showed similarly low growth rates to the ones cultured by ropes at the end of the experiment. This low growth rate can be attributed to several causes. The initial high growth rate could be favoured by the presence of the new substrate (i.e., the rigid net); however after the explant tissue engulfed the net, no longer substrate was available to extend on. On the other hand, fouling organisms, settled after some months of culture on the net-made cages, reduced water flow through the caged sponge. This flow reduction may represent a trophic depletion for the sponge, which may have hampered growth.Some generalization can be envisaged as for Dysidea avara growth: high growth rates have been recorded with the three methods assayed, but high growth variability has also been recorded among explants cultured under the same method. Thus intraspecific growth variability seems to be a common feature to both sponges under culture and wild specimens The relatively high growth rates obtained for the cultured sponges compared with the previous reported values for other species are probably due firstly to the particular species dynamism but secondly to the favourable hydrodynamics of the zone (e.g., strong water flow and high concentration of food particles in the water). Other authors have already stated that water flow intensity can greatly affect the growth of cultured sponges. In particular, high water movement generally promotes high growth through increased food availability.The lowest bioactivity presented by the explants cultured in cages is coincident with the low growth rates shown by these explants, which might be the result of a lower water flow across the cages and a consequent reduction of the available food for the explants. In contrast, the highest bioactivity was shown by explants handling from ropes, which is maybe due to the higher stress that this unstable substrate produced on the sponges.The explants glued to the substrate presented a similar bioactivity to the wild specimens, which points to this method as the best culture method for Dysidea avara culture, when obtaining secondary metabolites is attempted. However, investigation on the exact environmental factors that enhance metabolite production should be addressed before a culture method can be seriously proposed."

Traditional rope-based methods are unsuitable due to the sponge's soft consistency, so alternative methods (ropes, cages, and glue) were tested. Results show cages are best for survival, glue for growth, and ropes for bioactivity. The glue method is recommended overall due to balanced performance in growth and bioactivity despite higher mortality.","Marine sponges produce secondary metabolites that can be used as a natural source for the design of new drugs and cosmetics. There is, however, a supply problem with these natural substances for research and eventual commercialisation of the products. In situ sponge aquaculture is nowadays one of the most reliable methods to supply pharmaceutical companies with sufficient quantities of the target compound. In this study, we focus on the aquaculture of the sponge Dysidea avara (Schmidt, 1862), which produces avarol, a sterol with interesting pharmaceutical attributes. The soft consistency of this species makes the traditional culture method based on holding explants on ropes unsuitable. We have tested alternative culture methods for D. avara and optimized the underwater structures to hold the sponges to be used in aquaculture. Explants of this sponge were mounted on horizontal ropes, inside small cages or glued to substrates. Culture efficiency was evaluated by determination of sponge survival, growth rates, and bioactivity (as an indication of production of the target metabolite). While the cage method was the best method for explant survival, the glue method was the best one for explant growth and the rope method for bioactivity."
TA037589_C_0002,"The discussion highlights the lack of positive correlation between survival, growth, and bioactivity in cultured sponges. The glue method is recommended for Dysidea avara due to its superior growth and bioactivity, despite higher mortality. The study emphasizes the need for species-specific and environment-specific aquaculture methods, balancing survival and growth while considering metabolite production. Long-term experiments are crucial due to variability in growth and mortality over time.","When we consider survival, growth, and bioactivity of the cultured sponges altogether, it is made evident that the three variables are not positively correlated. While cages represent the best method for explant survival, gluing the explants is the best method for obtaining the highest growth and handling the explants from ropes produced the highest bioactivity. In our case, with all the results at hand, we will recommend to culture Dysidea avara explants with the glue method. Despite glued explants presented a higher mortality than the ones cultured in cages, their growth rates and their bioactivity compensated those losses. Moreover, for this species and under the environmental conditions assayed, we can propose the sponge aquaculture as a suitable alternative to harvesting those sponges from natural populations. The results of our assays indicate that it is highly important to select the most appropriate method, before starting a sponge culture. The best method will depend on the sponge species and the environmental characteristics of the culture location. This implies a previous knowledge of the biology and physiology (e.g., elasticity, recovery capability, growth) of the target species and the environmental conditions of the selected zone (e.g., water flow, T, etc.). A consensus between survival and growth must be achieved because generally the conditions that increase sponge growth (e.g., high water flow) are also the ones that increase explant mortality. Moreover, increasing the production of secondary metabolites of the sponges under culture has also to be considered. Finally, sponge growth rates were very different at six months that at ten months, which highlights the necessity of long-term experimental cultures for providing an accurate overview of the culture development. This especially applies when the target species are sponges with important variations in growth rates and mortality with time."
TA047353_I_0001,"The introduction highlights malaria as a major global health issue caused by Plasmodium falciparum, emphasizing the challenge of drug resistance and the potential of nanotechnology, particularly silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), as a novel therapeutic approach.","Malaria represents one of the most diffused human diseases caused by the mosquito bite, which is able to generate infection by introducing different species of Plasmodium into the host. Among them, P. falciparum represents the most dangerous and lethal parasite infecting humans. However, by considering the current drugs accessible for the prevention and treatment of this disease, it seems that, despite the effectiveness of available treatments, the main threat connected to malaria is the emergence of drug resistance. In this context, nanotechnology could represent a possible future solution against malaria drug resistance by introducing the control of drug release at the nanoscale or building active nanoparticles to be used against the parasite. In the last decades, the applications of nanotechnology have been mainly focused on the development of a large variety of nanoscale tools designed for their use in therapy, leading to the improvement of drug delivery strategies in order to overcame the barriers found in several conventional therapeutics. Among different nanomaterials, metal nanoparticles have been significantly studied thanks to their particular physical and chemical properties as alternative theranostic tools for treating a wide gamut of human diseases. Malaria can be one of the targets of these new strategic weapons."
TA047353_I_0002,"This section discusses the biomedical potential of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), their historical use in medicine, and the challenges of silver-based drugs, emphasizing the advantages of green synthesis using biological sources like Artemisia species for producing stable and low-toxicity AgNPs.","In this context, silver nanoparticles represent an ideal material for biomedical applications and have been largely investigated during the last years. The use of silver remedies in medicine has been a common practice until the past century, when it ceased with the discovery of antibiotics in the 1940’s. The development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, to which silver seems to be immune, renewed the interest toward this metal, and in the last few decades a large variety of silver compounds has been prepared, especially as coordination complexes, which also uncovered the great potential of silver as an anticancer, antifungal, antiparasitic and antimalarial agent. Regrettably, such compounds have been successful in in vitro experiments only, with a scarce possibility of applications in vivo due to the low bioavailability of the active species (the Ag+ ion) inside the organism when they were transferred to animal models. Still, the activity of silver-based drugs seems to be highly desirable, and the employment of AgNPs could bypass bioavailability problems, since they can act a reservoir of Ag+ ions inside the cell, released close to the molecular targets. According to the literature, silver nanoparticles are toxic for prokaryotic organisms, but relatively safe for eukaryotic species, including humans. Their cytotoxicity is associated to several characteristics, including reactivity in solution, size distribution, shape, coating/capping, etc., which in turn depend on the synthetic method used for their preparation. Indeed, conventional physical and chemical strategies for AgNPs synthesis are rather expensive, and reagents and solvents can be toxic. Thus, the preparation of eco-friendly metal nanoparticles using biological fluids represents a field of technology for nanomedicine applications which is growing with impressive speed. Generally, extracts from plants, bacteria and algae, plant-based phytochemicals, and other biological sources are used as the reducing agents in the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with high stability and low toxicity."
TA047353_I_0003,"This paragraph introduces the medicinal properties of Artemisia species, their traditional uses, and their potential in synthesizing AgNPs, focusing on A. abrotanum and A. arborescens for antimalarial applications.","The genus Artemisia, mainly diffused in the Northern hemisphere temperate regions, is one of the widest genera in the Asteraceae family, including more than 500 species, some of which have been traditionally used as folk remedies for the most disparate conditions, going from fever to common infections, intestinal parasites, hepatitis, and malaria. The therapeutic action of this genus of plants seems to be connected to the presence of a large variety of terpenes and thujones found in their extracts, which are currently being studied for the same applications. Artemisia annua is actually the source of artemisinin, which is one of the reference compounds, together with its derivative artesunate, in the antimalarial treatment, but also A. absinthium, A. afra, A. herba-alba, A. sieberi have been and are still widely used as antimalarial remedies. A. abrotanum, a plant probably native to Southwestern Europe and diffused in the temperate regions of Europe, Western Asia (Turkey and Armenia) and North America, also known as “southernwood”, has been employed in traditional medicine for treating a variety of disorders, including upper airway diseases, but it also showed interesting antimalarial properties. In a similar way, A. arborescens, a common species in ruderal environments on calcareous soils in the Mediterranean area, also known as “great mugwort” or “arborescent mugwort, is still used as an anti-inflammatory folk remedy; moreover, it was traditionally employed on the island of Sardinia as an infusion against malarial fevers and other diseases before the advent of modern drugs. Furthermore, several studies have reported the potential of A. arborescens compounds as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticancer agents. Following these studies, an idea emerged as to investigate and compare the effects of AgNPs grown from A. abrotanum and A. arborescens against malaria."
TA047353_I_0004,"The final paragraph outlines the novelty of using A. abrotanum and A. arborescens for AgNPs synthesis, comparing their antimalarial efficacy with chemically synthesized AgNPs, and setting the stage for the study's experimental approach.","As a matter of fact, many biologically active AgNPs have been prepared from other Artemisia sp. extracts. They all showed good antibacterial, anticancer and antifungal properties. Anyway, to the best of our knowledge, A. abrotanum extracts have been employed in the synthesis of magnesium oxide (MgO) or palladium (Pd) nanoparticles for catalytic purposes only, while A. arborescens has never been used to prepare metal nanoparticles. Considering all the advantages of “green” AgNPs and the medicinal properties of Artemisia plants, especially against malaria, the synthesis of silver nanoparticles here proposed has been carried out using these two different Artemisia species, A. abrotanum and A. arborescens, and the AgNPs thus prepared have also been compared to AgNPs from a traditional chemical reduction for their activity against P. falciparum parasite."
TA047353_M_0001,"The study involved the collection and identification of Artemisia abrotanum and Artemisia arborescens leaves, followed by the preparation of hydroalcoholic extracts. These extracts were used to synthesize silver nanoparticles through a green method, while a chemical synthesis method was also employed for comparison. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using various techniques including UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential measurement, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy to determine their physical and chemical properties.","Fresh A. abrotanum and A. arborescens leaves were collected in full thriving stage, in the months of February and March. Silver nanoparticles have been prepared using a modified version of the protocol reported in the literature by Khatoon et al.. Fresh leaves were washed to remove dust and dirt, dried on paper, then weighed (10 g), manually minced and extracted (150 mL ethanol: water 1:1) for 30 minutes at the temperature of 50 °C, to avoid possible degradation of bioactive molecules. The extracts were then filtered and used to reduce silver nitrate to AgNPs. In details, 100 mL of the hydroalcoholic extracts were diluted to 500 mL with milliQ water and slowly added to 500 mL water solution of AgNO3 (340 mg) to reach a final molarity of 2 mM, under magnetic stirring at room temperature. Reaction was complete within a day. Silver nanoparticles have also been synthesized through a classical chemical approach (0.1 M AgNO3, 0.3 mM ascorbic acid as the reductant and 0.3 mM sodium citrate as the stabilizer, at 30 °C; the pH was adjusted to 13 with NH4OH to ensure a relatively small size of the synthesized nanoparticles) and used for comparison. All AgNPs were recovered by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes. The yield of the reaction depended on the number of centrifuge cycles performed, and after 6 cycles about 60% of the initial silver was recovered, while the rest remained in suspension. The plasmonic peak of AgNPs was revealed by UV-Vis spectrum of the nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous buffer samples (1 mg/mL). Spectra were recorded by a Nicolet Evolution 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The determination of the average size distribution of the nanoparticles by dynamic light scattering was performed using the Zeta sizer Nano-S90 (Malvern Panalytical) by dispersing the dried powder (1 mg) in water (1 mL). The zeta potential (ζ) of AgNPs was measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZSP (Malvern Instruments) in backscatter configuration (θ = 173°; laser wavelength of λ = 633 nm). The scattering cell temperature was fixed at 298 K, and the data were analysed through the Zetasizer software 7.03 version. Samples were prepared by suspending AgNPs (1 mg/mL) in milliQ water, left under rotation for one hour and sonicated for 20 min before analysis. Samples for Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy were prepared as KBr pellets using nanoparticles or dried plant extracts (1% m/m). FTIR measurement were performed by recording the signals in the 400–4000 cm-1 range with a resolution of 4 cm-1 on a Vertex 70 Bruker spectrophotometer and analysed with OPUS 7 software. The X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was performed on a diffractometer (SmarLab model from Rigaku) aligned in the symmetrical Bragg-Brentano configuration with a Cu rotating anode source (lambda = 1.5418 A) and a graphite monochromator in the diffracted beam. Patterns were collected in the angular range from 25° to 120° in 2-theta, with a step-size of 0.05°, counting for 4 sec at each step. The Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis (TEM) were performed on FEI TECNAI G2 F20 TWIN instrument with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) was employed to collect the spectrum of elemental composition. Samples for TEM and EDX analyses were prepared by dispersing a small amount of nanoparticles in ethanol, sonicating them for 20 or 30 min, followed by the deposition of one or two drops of the suspension on a holey carbon/copper supported grid."

Parasite cultures were synchronized to obtain the ring stage, and parasitemia was assessed using light microscopy. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the significance of the results.","The pRBCs cultures previously obtained were provided in order to perform the hemolysis assay.

RBCs were purified from blood by centrifugation at 200 g for 5 min to remove plasma and leukocytes. RBCs were then washed three times in sterile complete growth medium as previously described. Parasitized RBCs cultures were maintained at 2–5% parasitemia (1% haematocrit) at 37 °C in a 95/5% (vol/vol) air/CO2-atmosphere. All assays were performed at this parasitemia and hematocrit. Hemolysis buffer (5 mmol/L sodium phosphate, 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0) was used as the positive control (Ctrl+), while PBS 1X and 5 mM glucose were used as the negative control (Ctrl-). To determine the hemolytic activity on pRBCs, nanoparticles suspension (stock = 1 mg/mL) prepared with sterile isotonic PBS 1X and 5 mM glucose was added to diluted pRBC culture (0.1 mL, ~ 2 × 108 cells/mL) at different concentrations (0.6, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 7.5 μg/mL) for 24 and 48 hours of incubation at 37 and 41 °C (Thermomixer). Then, samples were centrifuged at 200 g for 1 minute and a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific) was used to measure the absorbance of hemoglobin release in the supernatant. The absorbance value of hemoglobin at 600 nm was measured with the reference wavelength of 405 nm. The percent of hemolysis was calculated as follows: Hemolysis % = [(sample absorbance _ negative control)/ (positive control _ negative control)] _ 100%. 1 mg/mL of silver nanoparticles was serially diluted prior to addition to malaria cultures in PBS 1X and 5 mM glucose. Untreated cultures were run in parallel with the same final concentration. Cultures at the ring stage and fresh isolates of P. falciparum were treated for 24 and 48 hours in the presence of the indicated concentrations of all the tested silver nanoparticles: A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1), A. arborescens-AgNPs (2), AgNPs (3). All compounds were freshly prepared before any experiment and used immediately. The morphology and the total parasitemia assays were performed using a standard method. Parasite viability and parasitemia of PA strain were determined using Diff-Quick stained thin blood smears and light microscopy (Carl Zeiss Standard Microscope Lamphouse 467230). Parasitemia was defined as the number of parasites/number of RBCs counted, for a total of 5000 RBCs. Two thin smears per condition were counted 3 separate times by each of three operators. Cultures were synchronized weekly using Percoll separation or 5% sorbitol solution treatment in order to obtain the first parasite stage (rings) to start the experiments at 0 h. The experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. To calculate the half maximal inhibitory concentrations of the different silver nanoparticles, ICEstimator software version 1.2 was used. The program estimates IC50 values using a nonlinear regression function of the R software. Data analyses were performed using Prism GraphPad software. Statistics for experiments were performed using a t-test. In all cases * was used for p < 0.05, ** for p < 0.01, and *** for p < 0.001. Values were expressed as the mean ± SD. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate."
TA047353_R_0001,Introduction to the study on green silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) derived from Artemisia species for antimalarial efficacy against P. falciparum. The study highlights the limitations of current antimalarial drugs and the potential of AgNPs as an alternative.,"Malaria represents one of the most common infectious diseases which becoming an impellent public health problem worldwide. Antimalarial classical medications include quinine-based drugs, like chloroquine, and artesunate, a derivative of artemisinin, a molecule found in the plant Artemisia annua. Such therapeutics are very effective but show heavy side effects like drug resistance. In this study, ""green"" silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been prepared from two Artemisia species (A. abrotanum and A. arborescens), traditionally used in folk medicine as a remedy for different conditions, and their potential antimalarial efficacy have been assessed. AgNPs have been characterized by UV-Vis, dynamic light scattering and zeta potential, FTIR, XRD, TEM and EDX. The structural characterization has demonstrated the spheroidal shape of nanoparticles and dimensions under 50 nm, useful for biomedical studies. Zeta potential analysis have shown the stability and dispersion of green AgNPs in aqueous medium without aggregation. AgNPs hemocompatibility and antimalarial activity have been studied in Plasmodium falciparum cultures in in vitro experiments. The antiplasmodial effect has been assessed using increasing doses of AgNPs (0.6 to 7.5 μg/mL) on parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs). Obtained data showed that the hemocompatibility of AgNPs is related to their synthetic route and depends on the administered dose. A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) have shown the lowest percentage of hemolytic activity on pRBCs, underlining their hemocompatibility. These results are in accordance with the lower levels of parasitemia observed after A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) treatment respect to A. arborescens-AgNPs (2), and AgNPs (3) derived from a classical chemical synthesis. Moreover, after 24 and 48 hours of A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) treatment, the parasite growth was locked in the ring stage, evidencing the effect of these nanoparticles to hinder the maturation of P. falciparum. The anti-malarial activity of A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) on pRBCs was demonstrated to be higher than that of A. arborescens-AgNPs (2)."
TA047353_R_0002,"Detailed methodology and characterization results of green AgNPs synthesized from Artemisia species, including UV-Vis, DLS, zeta potential, FTIR, XRD, TEM, and EDX analyses. The study confirms the spheroidal shape and size below 50 nm, with good stability and dispersion.","""Green"" AgNPs have been prepared from leaf extracts using a modified method for analogous AgNPs from A. annua (different extracts-to-silver ratio) as summarised in (Fig 1), which shows the synthetic process using the two different species of Artemisia plants. This change was introduced in the attempt of preparing particles with a small size (under 50 nm) useful for biological applications. However, we need to consider that AgNPs can cause hemolysis, which was found to be size- and dose-dependent, being higher for very small nanoparticles. Cell uptake is also correlated to the nanoparticle size, being optimal for middle-sized AgNPs, around 50 nm. The characterization of AgNPs synthetized using Artemisia leaf extract was carried out by a series of spectroscopic analyses. The UV-Vis spectra show the AgNPs surface plasmon resonance effect which reflects the method of synthesis, in turn affecting nanoparticle shape and size. Data results indicate that the peak observed in the range 400–450 nm was increased in A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) and A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) respect to ""classical"" AgNPs (3), suggesting a spheroidal shape for these nanoparticles with a size below 50 nm (Fig 2). Contrarily, ""classical"" AgNPs (3) displayed a lower absorbance intensity, probably due to their aggregation in solution (Fig 2). Dynamic light scattering analyses were used to evaluate the size distribution of AgNPs in aqueous dispersion. The average hydrodynamic size of ""green"" nanoparticles was around 37 nm for A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1), and 30 nm for A. arborescens-AgNPs (2), respectively (Fig 3A and 3B). All ""green"" nanoparticles were well dispersed in aqueous medium showing no aggregation in solution. On the other hand, AgNPs (3) from the classical chemical reduction appeared to be rather aggregated. However, dynamic light scattering analyses revealed their average size to be around 60 nm (Fig 3C). In order to describe the nanoparticles stability in aqueous medium, zeta potential analysis was performed. A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) and A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) have shown a good zeta potential value (Fig 3D) underlining their good dispersion in aqueous medium without aggregation (S2 and S3 Figs). Contrariwise, ""classical"" AgNPs (3) displayed a low zeta potential value (-2.9 ± 0.3) (Fig 3D and S4 Fig) evidencing their propensity to aggregation in accordance with the other characterization results reported. The evaluation of the structural features of the nanoparticle surface plays a significant role in the understanding of the possible effects of AgNPs on the cell membrane for biological applications. FT-IR spectra (Fig 4A) were recorded to evaluate the surface capping of the ""green"" compared to ""classical"" nanoparticles. There is a sharp difference in the aspect of the spectra for ""green"" respect to ""classical"" AgNPs (3) (Fig 4A), the former showing a number of bands which are not present in the latter, thus confirming the formation of the capping. Such peaks can be tentatively attributed to amines, proteins or polyphenolic compounds of Artemisia leaf extracts. The very broad band going from 3100 to 3600 cm-1 is encompassing the OH and NH stretching frequencies, the signals around 2900 cm-1 are due to the CH stretching mode of hydrocarbon moieties, while those around 1620 (ν C = O) are most probably due to the carbonyl group of amidic compounds (i.e. proteins and enzymes). A series of bands can be attributed to polyphenols: 2920 cm-1 (stretching of the C-H bond adjacent to a quinone moiety), 1440 cm-1 (stretching of the C = C bond adjacent to the quinone system) and 1250 cm-1 (stretching of the C = C bonds of the various coupled aromatic systems). Moreover, the band in the range 1400–1380 cm-1 may be attributed to silver nanoparticles in accordance with the literature. As for the AgNPs (3) from classical reduction, the broad band around 3400–3300 cm-1 is due to water molecules, while the peaks in the regions 1600–1500 and 1400–1300 cm-1 can be attributed to the overlapping of the COO- asymetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations, respectively, of citrate and ascorbate anions present on the nanoparticle surface. A comparison between the FTIR of the dry plant extracts and the relative AgNPs has been undertaken to add more information about the capping. The two sets of spectra are similar but not identical, showing that most but not all the biomolecules present in the plant extract have contributed to the formation of the capping (Fig 4A). The XRD patterns showed a progression of broadened line profiles which was matched with the presence of Ag metal phase with space group Fm-3m and a = 4.0853 (4 Ag atoms in the unit cell). In Fig 4B, the crystalline peaks were reported and the XRD data were in agreement with the standard JCPD file no. 04–0783. It should be noted that the pattern reported by Kathoon et al. is similar to our recorded progression. The peak profile phase was broadened on account of sensible effects due to crystallite size smallness and lattice strain. These are determined by the Rietveld program to be D = 200 A and e = 0.0023 for Ag. Finally, the samples were prepared for TEM and EDX characterization. Fig 5 shows TEM images of AgNPs, which were close to spherical shape and not fully homogenous in the size range, which anyway appeared to be regular and well below 50 nm in diameter (range 20–30 nm). Moreover, EDX profile confirmed the elemental composition by evidencing the silver peak of each kind of nanoparticle (S1 Fig). The Cu peak also present in the spectrum is due to the grid."
TA047353_R_0003,"Hemocompatibility and antimalarial activity results of green AgNPs, including hemolysis assays and parasite growth inhibition studies. The study demonstrates dose-dependent effects and highlights the superior performance of A. abrotanum-AgNPs.","The hemolysis assay has commonly been performed at body and fever temperature (37°C and 41°C, respectively) at concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 7.5 μg/mL up to 48 hours of incubation (Fig 6). Testing both temperature conditions is of particular interest for nanomaterials, as they should be used for therapeutic purposes, which might encounter complex states such as fever. All the tested nanomaterials presented dose-dependent hemolysis on pRBCs after the first 24 hours of incubation, except for AgNPs (3), (Fig 6). At concentration below 5 μg/mL, the hemolytic effect of all tested AgNPs was not significant, as shown in Fig 6. Contrarily, a significant hemolytic activity of the ""green"" nanoparticles is reported at concentration above 5 μg/mL (p < 0.01). In particular, A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) have shown an evident effect on pRBCs at 5 and 7.5 μg/mL dosage (p < 0.01 and 7 μg/mL p < 0.001 respectively for both temperature conditions) compared to A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1), probably due to the different capping and size (Fig 6). Instead, AgNPs (3) did not reveal any significant hemolytic activity in dosages below 7.5 μg/mL at physiological and fever temperature (Fig 6). Otherwise, when measured at fever temperature (41°C) a two-fold increase in hemolysis at 5 and 7.5 μg/mL dosages, compared to lower dosages (0.6, 1.25 and 2.5 μg/mL) of ""green"" nanoparticles, was observed (Fig 6). In this study, green nanoparticles have shown the hemolytic effects on pRBCs at high dosages (5 and 7.5 μg/mL) due to their small size and their different nature of synthesis. Previous studies have confirmed our findings that the size of AgNPs used in high dosages is a critical factor of hemolysis and especially small sized AgNPs, display a great ability to induce hemolysis in pRBCs. Contrariwise, the AgNPs (3) derived from the classical synthesis have shown low activity against parasites and low hemolytic effects probably due to their strong aggregation and their large size. Considering the non-hemolytic activity reported at low dosage of nanoparticles, the next experiments of percentage of parasitemia and morphological study on pRBCs have been performed using the intermediate dosage (2.5 μg/mL). The next experiments have been carried out using the non hemolytic concentration of nanoparticles as previously described. In particular, pRBCs were treated with increasing doses of all nanoparticles (0.6 to 7.5 μg/mL) at both 24 and 48 hours in order to evaluate the effect of parasite growth inhibition. Palo Alto (PA) has been used as a representative strain as no significant differences have been observed among the other strains tested (FCB1, It-G and ARS1). A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) and A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) have demonstrated significant in vitro activity against P. falciparum in pRBCs, showing dose-dependent hemolytic effect (Fig 6) connected to the parasite death and a consequent decrease of parasitemia (Fig 7) compared to ""classical"" AgNPs (3). In particular, these nanoparticles, even at low concentrations (0.6 μg/mL), presented a modest decrease in parasitemia during the first cycle of growth (24 h) and a substantial decrease in parasitemia during the second cycle (48 h) (Fig 7). Considering the evident hemolytic activity of nanoparticles at high concentration, to further evaluate the effects on parasite maturation and death a morphology investigation was performed on PA strain using the most efficient low dosage (2.5 μg/mL). In details, it was found that A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) showed antiplasmodial activity by blocking the parasite maturation stage from trophozoite to rings (Fig 8). On the contrary, A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) have demonstrated their antiplasmodial activity achieving the parasite death compared to the control after 24 and 48 hours of treatment (Fig 8). Moreover, A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) showed the best antiplasmodial activity considering the IC50,90,99 as reported in Table 1."

TA047353_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the importance of nanoparticle properties (size, shape, capping) in determining their biological activity. A. abrotanum-AgNPs exhibited lower aggregation and better morphology, correlating with their superior antiplasmodial efficacy. Hemolytic activity was influenced by temperature and nanoparticle concentration, with non-hemolytic doses identified below 5 μg/mL. Morphological alterations in P. falciparum strains treated with Artemisia-derived AgNPs were linked to their small size and unique capping. Despite smaller size, A. arborescens-AgNPs showed lower activity, possibly due to differences in capping biomolecules. Overall, the study underscores the effectiveness of A. abrotanum-AgNPs in combating malaria.","It is known that a critical step in biomedical applications of nanoparticles is to study their physical-chemical properties in order to correlate their biological activity to specific parameters such as composition, size, shape and capping. In this study, considering the same concentration of nanoparticles used for the analysis, the difference observed during the evaluation of each nanoparticle activity may depend on these parameters. In this context, A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) have demonstrated a lower aggregation in aqueous medium and better shape and dimension compared to the other nanoparticles taken into consideration. In order to investigate each AgNPs type effects on PA cultures, their chemical structure has been studied and correlated with their activity and biocompatibility. Indeed, to study the effect of “green” AgNPs on RBCs biocompatibility, several in vitro experiments have been performed on human pRBCs infected by P. falciparum. After the nanoparticles characterization, their hemolytic properties in contact with the human erythrocytes were studied. The increase in hemolytic activity observed is probably due to the higher temperature used for fever simulation, where the RBCs could be sensitive to the temperature of 41°C. On the other hand, based on the large hemolysis dependence on fever temperature, non-hemolytic concentrations were assessed below 5 μg/mL. It is noteworthy that after 24 hours of incubation there was no further increase of the hemolytic activity. The different hemolysis effect could be assigned to the difference in the size of nanoparticles and/or the different biomolecules present in the capping, which cannot be excluded. In fact, it has been reported that the variety of shape, size and chemistry of nanoparticles produce different effects on the biological environment. However, to further evaluate the effects on parasite maturation and death, a morphology investigation was performed on different strains of P. falciparum pRBCs. The striking morphological alteration observed in fixed blood smears of PA strain treated with A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) and A. arborescens-AgNPs (2), is again most probably linked to the small size and the different nature of synthesis using Artemisia extracts. Despite the smaller size of A. arborescens-AgNPs (2) respect to the other nanoparticles, which should confer them higher efficacy, their lower activity against the parasite may depend on the different capping from the A. arborescens plant extract used. Anyway, this method of synthesis has indeed allowed to create small size nanoparticles useful for biomedical applications connected to an effective action against P. falciparum parasite. In general, all the results gathered in this study underline the higher antiplasmodial efficacy of AgNPs from A. abrotanum extract respect to the A. arborescens ones."

A. abrotanum-AgNPs exhibited superior efficacy, likely due to their small size and unique bio-capping properties. The hemolytic effect was dose-dependent, with smaller nanoparticles showing greater activity. The mechanism of action is speculated to involve ROS generation, mitochondrial apoptosis, and membrane damage, though further research is needed. The findings underscore the potential of AgNPs as novel antimalarial tools.","The present work was performed as a pilot study in order to evaluate Artemisia sp. derived silver nanoparticles potential antimalarial efficacy in parasitized human red blood cell and to understand their efficacy against P. falciparum as a new nanotool against malaria. The obtained results have demonstrated that plant extracts derived from A. abrotanum and A. arborescens can be used for the facile biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles and to create a bio-capping on the AgNPs useful to modulate their activity against P. falciparum cultures in in vitro experiments. Results evidenced a high anti-malarial activity for A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) in compared to A. arborescens-AgNPs (2). Their hemolytic effect is dose-dependent, and is more pronounced for the smallest AgNPs, i.e. those derived from A. arborescens, as expected. The high anti-malarial activity for A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) is connected to the small size of nanoparticles and their different effect on the parasite cycle. In fact, results underlined that A. abrotanum-AgNPs (1) were been able to hinder the stage of the maturation of the parasite locking it in the ring stage after treatment. The mechanism behind this behaviour is still unknown. Studies reporting the biological bases of antiprotozoal action of silver nanoparticles are very rare, so the details on the processes leading to their antiplasmodium effects are lacking and proper investigation should be undertaken as soon as possible in order to cover this important topic and allow a more efficacious research to fight malaria with these new nanoweapons. Anyhow, the study on AgNPs antibacterial properties unveiled some relevant aspects of their activity, which can be mainly connected to the generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) as the promoter of cell death mechanisms, especially via mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, together with extensive damage to the cell membrane and enzyme deactivation via silver binding (17). All these events, alone or combined, could be able to disrupt the functions of plasmodium cells, leading to the consequences observed in our experiments. Considering the data presented in this study, the antiplasmodial activity of Artemisia-derived AgNPs in in vitro experiments against P. falciparum is promising and deserves further research."

In spite of its widespread applications in agriculture and medicine, the molecular aspects of the biosynthesis of neem terpenoids remain largely unexplored. The current report describes the draft genome and four transcriptomes of A. indica and attempts to contextualise the sequence information in terms of its molecular phylogeny, transcript expression and terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. A. indica is the first member of the family Meliaceae to be sequenced using next generation sequencing approach. Results: The genome and transcriptomes of A. indica were sequenced using multiple sequencing platforms and libraries. The A. indica genome is AT-rich, bears few repetitive DNA elements and comprises about 20,000 genes. The molecular phylogenetic analyses grouped A. indica together with Citrus sinensis from the Rutaceae family validating its conventional taxonomic classification. Comparative transcript expression analysis showed either exclusive or enhanced expression of known genes involved in neem terpenoid biosynthesis pathways compared to other sequenced angiosperms. Genome and transcriptome analyses in A. indica led to the identification of repeat elements, nucleotide composition and expression profiles of genes in various organs. Conclusions: This study on A. indica genome and transcriptomes will provide a model for characterization of metabolic pathways involved in synthesis of bioactive compounds, comparative evolutionary studies among various Meliaceae family members and help annotate their genomes.

The quality, quantity of genomic DNA and integrity of total RNA were accessed using Nanodrop, Qubit methods and Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Nano chip respectively before using the DNA and RNA in making sequencing libraries. Short-insert paired-end sequencing libraries were prepared using Illumina (San Diego, California, USA) TruSeq™ library preparation kit with one modification. The library was not amplified post-adapter ligation to minimize amplification-related bias and the un-amplified, adapterligated library was directly used to generate clusters on cBOT instrument following the manufacturer's recommendation. Long-insert mate pair sequencing libraries were prepared using multiple inserts (10 kbp, 3 kbp and 1.5 kbp) using Illumina mate pair library preparation kit. RNA-seq sequencing libraries from all the four organs were prepared using Illumina TruSeq-RNA library prep kit following the manufacturers instructions. Genomic DNA of neem was sheared to 200 bp using Covaris (Woburn, Massachusetts, USA) to make libraries using IonTorrent PGM protocol. Sequencing was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA (2-11 kbp) was cloned into pJAZZ-OC linear cloning vector using BigEasy v2.0 kit from Lucigen (Middleton, Wisconsin, USA) following manufacturer's specifications. Following cloning, positive colonies were picked and sub-cultured. Plasmid DNA was isolated and checked for inserts by restriction digestion. Positive clones were selected and used for capillary sequencing. Neem genomic DNA clones were used for capillary sequencing using BigDye Terminator kit using the manufacturer's instructions. Positive clones were selected and used for sequencing in either forward or reverse direction using M13 primers using the Applied Biosystems 3500 instrument."
TA025546_M_0002,"The neem genome was assembled using a combination of Illumina short-insert and long-insert libraries, capillary sequencing reads, and pyro-sequencing reads with SOAPdenovo. Transcriptomes from roots, leaves, stems, and flowers were assembled using Trinity. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using rbcL and rbcS genes, following MIAPA standards. Repeat elements in the genome were identified using tools like RepeatModeler, RepeatMasker, LTR_Finder, and MITE-Hunter. The insertion age of LTR retrotransposons was calculated using Kimura distance values. Nucleotide composition and expression profiles were analyzed, and transcripts were annotated using BLAST and BLAS-T2GO. Gene predictions were made using GlimmerHMM and PASA. Organ-specific transcript expression pathways were mapped to KEGG pathways, and differential expression levels were compared across species.","Two sets of Illumina short insert (150 bp and 350 bp) paired-end libraries and three long insert (1.5 kbp, 3 kbp and 10 kbp) mate-pair libraries, capillary Sanger sequencing reads generated from cloned neem genomic DNA and pyro-sequencing reads generated with IonTorrent Personal Genome Machine were used in assembling the neem genome with SOAPdenovo. We assembled the neem transcriptomes from all organs using the raw RNA-seq paired reads from four organs: root, leaf, stem and flower using the genomeindependent transcriptome assembler Trinity. The concatenated alignment of either the rbcL and rbcS genes of 24 plant species including neem or rbcL gene alone for Meliaceae family members were used to generate a bootstrapped phylogeny using Phylip v3.69. For reporting the phylogenetic analysis results, we followed the Minimal Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis standard. Repeat Modeler, Repeat Masker, LTR_Finder, TransposonPSI and MITE-Hunter were used to detect, identify and characterize repeats in the neem genome. Vmatch was used to cluster repeat sequences and build a consensus neem repeat library. Five prime and three prime LTR sequences of each LTR-retrotransposon, identified by LTR finder, were aligned using ClustalW MPI. The distances between five prime and three prime LTR sequences for each alignment were calculated using the Kimura 2 parameter distmat tool from EMBOSS package. The insertion ages were further calculated from these distance values according to the formula T equals K divided by two times r, where T is the insertion age in years, K equals Kimura distance value and r is the substitution rate per site per year. The nucleotide composition of the transcripts from the neem organs and genome scaffolds or chromosomes of the neem, A. thaliana, O. sativa and V. vinifera were plotted as frequency histograms and density curves. The fragments per transcript kilobase per million fragments provided by Trinity were log2 transformed and plotted as frequency histograms for each organ, before and after categorizing the transcripts based on their G plus C composition. The transcripts were serially annotated for each organ using similarity-based BLAST analyses and functionally classified using BLAS-T2GO analyses. Gene predictions were performed using GlimmerHMM and PASA. Inter-species gene comparison was performed as described in Text S1 in Additional file. The transcripts for individual organs in neem were mapped to KEGG pathways using the KAAS server. The KO-assigned transcripts were divided into low and high expression categories. A heat-map of these across the four organs was computed using R. Analyses using KEGG were also carried out for other species, namely A. thaliana, O. sativa, V. vinifera and C. sinensis, focusing on the enzymes mapping to the azadirachtin-A biosynthesis pathway. The differential transcript expression level indices of these enzymes in neem relative to other species were compared. The gene structures for these enzymes, and the structures of the top and bottom ten transcripts ranked according to their expression levels were compared across all species. KEGG annotations obtained for transcripts from all organs were parsed to retain only the un-annotated ones. PASA assemblies, establishing correspondence between each organ's transcripts and common genomic loci were obtained for the same. The top 300 highly expressed un-annotated transcripts for each organ were chosen, filtered for redundancies, to yield a total of 888 unique assemblies. A heat-map was plotted using the log2 FPKM values of these transcripts using R."

TA025546_R_0002,"The study investigates the fumigant toxicity of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil against Sitophilus zeamais adults, showing dose- and time-dependent mortality. The oil's major constituents, terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol, exhibit potent toxicity. Enzyme inhibition assays reveal significant dose- and time-dependent suppression of AChE, GST, and CarE activities. RNA-Seq analysis identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to detoxification and energy metabolism, with KEGG pathway enrichment highlighting respiration and xenobiotic metabolism disruptions.","Result: To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais. The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed. To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C). A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes). To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil. To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable."

Both neem and citrus belong to the Order Rutales and our phylogenetic studies reaffirmed their taxonomic closeness. Additionally, phylogenetic studies grouped A. indica with the Melia species, one that is also known to harbour bioactive compounds (Figure [2b](#page-3-0)) suggesting a common evolutionary process with regard to synthesis of these compounds in Meliaceae. Repeat analysis showed low repeat content in A. indica genome compared with other sequenced angiosperms. This could have been due to the presence of xenobiotic terpenoids specific to the plant, which might have been a major impediment for horizontal gene transfer [[50](#page-12-0)]. This impediment in horizontal gene transfer could have skewed the conventional host-pathogen interactions countering the accumulation of repeats in A. indica compared to other contemporary angiosperms. Insertion times of LTR elements in neem suggest a major wave of retrotransposition about 1million years ago (Figure [3](#page-4-0)), similar to the observation made in S. bicolor [[28](#page-11-0)]. However, in A. indica the oldest insertion event date back much further than S. bicolor (13.35 million years in neem against 3 million years in Sorghum, Figure [3\)](#page-4-0). Monocot genomes have higher GC content than dicots, which is reflected in an average difference in codon usage between them [\[51,52](#page-12-0)]. Interestingly, like O. sativa [[53](#page-12-0)] but unlike A. thaliana and others [[54](#page-12-0)], the A. indica genome shows a bimodal distribution of GC content (Figure S11 in Additional file [2](#page-11-0)). Domesticated crop genomes with higher GC content are likely to have evolved by a relaxation of a natural selection process against higher nitrogen use in DNA due to the use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers [\[55](#page-12-0)]. A. indica, a hardy plant, is not domesticated and can grow in poor and degraded soil including in semi-arid conditions with tolerance for high temperature [\[56\]](#page-12-0). Additionally, there is no history of any usage of nitrogen rich fertilizers to grow A. indica. This might have played a role in shaping the AT-rich nucleotide composition of A. indica genome. Transcript abundances of genes in A. indica correlated well with their functions in respective organs; for example, root, leaf, stem and flower showed the presence of highly expressed ones involved in ion homeostasis, photosynthesis, ion transport and ATPase activity, respectively. Unlike the genome, A. indica transcriptomes exhibited unimodal GC distribution roughly overlapping with the higher GC peak of the genome (Figure S11 in Additional file [2](#page-11-0)). The distribution of A + T in A. indica transcriptomes mapped closer to the A. thaliana transcriptome than to the ones in O. sativa or V. vinifera (Figure S11 in Additional file [2](#page-11-0)). The lengths and the GC content of the first exons and first introns are reported to be associated with functional elements in other large genomes [\[57\]](#page-12-0). The GC content of the first exons and first introns in A. indica were similar to that of other exons and introns in the genome (Figure [7\)](#page-6-0). Highly expressed primary transcripts of A. indica bear longer intron structures suggesting their possible functional role in expression and conforming with the results shown in other plants [[58](#page-12-0)] and yeast [\[59\]](#page-12-0)."
TA025546_D_0002,"The study underscores the agricultural and medicinal significance of neem, particularly its role in sustainable farming through biopesticides like azadirachtin.

The research identifies key genes in terpenoid and steroid biosynthesis that are more abundant in neem compared to other plants, providing insights for biotechnological applications. The findings aim to bridge traditional knowledge with modern agrochemical practices, addressing the rising costs of synthetic pesticides and promoting eco-friendly solutions.","Sequencing and analysis of the genome and transcriptomes of neem holds significance due to the plant's utility in agriculture and medicine. The use of botanical products as pest control and deterrence has acquired greater significance with the shifting trends in mainstream agriculture towards sustainable and organic farming. Neem provides a suitable option for developing such eco-friendly and sustainable pesticides [\[56\]](#page-12-0). Currently a very small percentage of farmers use neem-based products as a substitute to synthetic pesticides as the general awareness of such practices remains limited. Azadirachtin, derived from neem seed kernels, has been proved to be a potent and effective pesticide. Total chemical synthesis of azadirachtin is challenging owing to the low yield of synthesis and remains a bottleneck for commercial bulk manufacturing. Secondary metabolites synthesized by terpene synthases are the major components of essential oils and are of great economic value. In plants, synthesis of terpenes is compartmentalized into monoterpenes and diterpenes (as well as carotenoids and chlorophylls) that are produced via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway in the plastids while the sesquiterpenes and triterpenes are made in the cytosol via the mevalonate pathway [[60](#page-12-0)]. The enzymes involved in the synthesis of azadirachtin have not been studied in detail. The pathway hierarchy in neemderived tetranortriterpenoid azadirachtin-A primarily requires the synthesis of a terpenoid backbone followed by steroid and triterpenoid biosynthesis. We found that the genes in the terpenoids and steroid biosynthesis family (TPS21, lytB, ispH, ispE, GGPS, +neomenthol dehydrogenase, FDPS, FDFT1 and SQLE) were more abundant in neem compared to A. thaliana, O. sativa, C. sinensis and V. vinifera. This study may help close the gap between traditional knowledge and current practices in the agrochemical industry. The progressive increase in the cost of petroleumbased starting materials has led to a surge in the price of synthetic pesticides scourging the meager profit margins presented to the farmers in developing countries. This study may provide a cost-effective alternative by aiding biotechnological research efforts in enhancing disease resistance in plants."

TA002480_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the extensive mortality caused by bark beetle outbreaks, particularly the mountain pine beetle, and emphasizes the importance of surviving trees for ecological resilience and genetic resistance, while noting the lack of comprehensive studies on the interactions between chemical and anatomical defenses in post-outbreak stands.","Periodic outbreaks of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) have caused extensive tree mortality, significantly altering forest structure and function and shifting affected areas from carbon sinks to carbon sources. For instance, recent outbreaks of the mountain pine beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) have devastated millions of hectares of mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests in western North America. Despite this widespread mortality, certain individual trees—pine and nonpine species—have survived these outbreaks. These surviving trees are crucial for maintaining ecological resilience within bark beetle-affected forests and may serve as a genetic reservoir of traits that confer resistance to future outbreaks, thereby contributing to the overall health and diversity of forest ecosystems. Given their importance, numerous studies have reported on the impact of bark beetle outbreaks on these surviving trees, focusing on their post-outbreak defences (chemical or anatomical) and postoutbreak growing conditions. While several studies have separately examined the impact of bark beetle outbreaks on anatomical and chemical defence mechanisms of the surviving trees, few have explored the complex relationship between these defence modalities in the post-outbreak stands. This study aims to retrospectively examine the relationship between the constitutive terpenes in the current year's phloem of surviving pine trees and the historical resin duct characteristics of the same trees before and after the MPB outbreak in lodgepole pine stands affected by the outbreak."
TA002480_I_0002,"The introduction discusses the multifaceted defense strategies of conifers against bark beetles, focusing on the roles of terpenes (monoterpenes and diterpenes) and resin ducts, and highlights the importance of non-structural carbohydrates in supporting terpene production, while noting the variability in reported associations between terpenes and NSCs.","Interactions between conifers and bark beetles represent well-studied systems, integrating molecular, chemical, and ecological perspectives to elucidate the outcomes of these interactions. Bark beetles feed, mate, and lay eggs within the subcortical tissues (phloem/cambial zone) of mature trees, making them prominent agents of mortality in coniferous forests. When confronted with bark beetle attacks, conifer trees employ a multifaceted defence strategy, involving both defence compounds and anatomical structures. Resin, a mixture of terpenes, serve as the primary defence against bark beetles for conifers. Monoterpenes and diterpenes, in particular, have received more attention due to their biological effects on bark beetles and their fungal associates. Pine phloem, the feeding site for bark beetles, contains large quantities of monoterpenes and diterpenes, which are expressed constitutively and are induced. The production of these terpenes is supported in part by non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), such as soluble sugars and starch. These NSCs are vital for various physiological and metabolic processes in trees. They also serve as substrates for secondary metabolite production. Changes in carbohydrate production can impact both the storage and production of secondary metabolites, such as terpenes. While some studies report a positive association between terpenes and NSCs in tree phloem, others do not."
TA002480_I_0003,"The introduction describes the anatomical defenses of conifers, particularly resin ducts, and their role in resin flow and tree survival against bark beetles, while referencing previous findings on the distinct anatomical and chemical defense traits of surviving trees post-outbreak.","Anatomical defences of conifers primarily involve the synthesis and storage of resin in specialized structures known as resin cells and resin ducts. These structures are interconnected axially and radially. Resin ducts are distributed throughout the primary and secondary xylem as well as the cortical tissues. Resin accumulated within these structures is transported to the point of bark beetle attacks. Consequently, the morphology of xylem resin ducts is often associated with the quantity of resin flow in response to wounds in the phloem. In some cases, resin ducts are linked to tree survival against bark beetles, with larger duct sizes and higher duct numbers showing stronger relationships with survival. Our earlier investigations demonstrated distinct anatomical defence traits in surviving trees following MPB outbreaks compared to those killed by MPBs. Consequently, the surviving trees contained higher concentrations of monoterpenes. However, the interaction between these chemical and anatomical defences remains unknown within the lodgepole pine system."
TA002480_I_0004,"The introduction outlines the study's objectives to investigate correlations between post-outbreak terpene concentrations, historical resin duct characteristics, radial growth, and tree growth traits, while exploring potential relationships between defense traits and NSCs and any trade-offs between monoterpene and diterpene defenses.","Therefore, our primary objective is to retrospectively investigate whether the constitutive concentrations of post-outbreak monoterpenes and diterpenes in the phloem of surviving pine trees correlate with the historical resin duct characteristics, radial growth, and tree growth traits (age and size) before and after MPB outbreaks in post-outbreak lodgepole pine stands. Additionally, we explored potential relationships between defence traits (chemical or anatomical) and NSCs in the phloem and any trade-offs between monoterpene and diterpene defences following the MPB outbreak. This study aims to shed light on the complex relationship between various defence modalities and tree characteristics amidst the MPB outbreak, providing valuable insights into the legacy impact of bark beetles on host trees."
TA002480_M_0001,"The study involved selecting five lodgepole pine-dominated forests in Jasper National Park, Alberta, which had experienced recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks. Healthy and beetle-killed trees were sampled, with phloem and increment cores collected for chemical and anatomical analysis. Phloem samples were analyzed for monoterpenes, diterpenes, and non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). Increment cores were used to assess resin duct characteristics and growth patterns.","In July 2020, we identified five lodgepole pine-dominated forests in Jasper National Park, Alberta (Canada). Lodgepole pine constituted 45–59% of the total live and dead tree density (height > 1.3 m) in sites 1–3 and 100% in sites 4 and 5 (Table S1). Douglas-fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*), white spruce (*Picea glauca*), and aspen (*Populus tremuloides*) were the other tree species in these sites. All sites had experienced a recent MPB outbreak, as documented in historical records provided by Parks Canada. The outbreaks occurred in sites 1–3 in 2015 and in sites 4 and 5 in 2014. The sites were located at least 500 m apart. We gathered data on the on-site slope using a clinometer and aspect using a compass. Tree density at a site was calculated using an angle gauge with a basal area factor of 4.6 metric (20 standard). The tree species, health status (alive or killed by MPBs), and diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.3 m height) were measured for all trees within the plot (Table S1). Trees killed by MPBs were identified through characteristic pitch tubes, brood emergence holes on the tree stems, blue stains, and oviposition (maternal) galleries under the tree bark. Conversely, the healthy lodgepole pines exhibited no visible symptoms of insect or pathogen attacks. We selected 12 pairs of beetle-killed and healthy lodgepole pine trees in each site, with the DBH ranging from 18 to 22 cm (*n* = 60 trees per category). We obtained two phloem samples using a leather hollow punch that was 1.9 cm in diameter from each of the four cardinal directions at 1.3 m from ground on healthy trees (8 samples per tree). The punch was cleaned using 70% ethanol before each sampling. The samples were wrapped in labelled aluminium foil and immediately placed into liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored on dry ice during transportation from the field to the laboratory and put in a −40 ◦C freezer until chemical analysis. Furthermore, we obtained one increment core with a diameter of 5 mm and one with a diameter of 12 mm at 1 m above the ground from the north and south aspects of each health tree. The core that was 5 mm in diameter was drilled to the pith of the tree and used to determine its age. The cores with a 12 mm diameter contained at least 20 years of annual rings, dating back from the sampling year, which were used to determine the anatomical defence and growth characteristics of trees in the last 15 years. The cores were stored in plastic drinking straws. To determine the year of the outbreak in each site, we took a wedge from the south-facing aspect of each beetle-killed tree at the DBH. The wedges contained at least 20 years of growth, counting back from the year of death. After removing the outer bark from the phloem samples, we ground the samples in liquid N with a mini bead beater at 2200 rpm for three 20 s intervals. The eight samples from each tree were pooled together before analysis. The samples from each tree were divided into three groups for the following chemical analyses: monoterpenes (100 mg), diterpenes (30 mg), and NSCs (30 mg). All these analyses followed the protocols reported by Cale et al. Monoterpenes were extracted using hexane and analyzed with GC-MS, while diterpenes were extracted with methanol and analyzed using UHPLC. NSCs were extracted and analyzed using enzymatic digestions and UHPLC."
TA002480_M_0002,"Anatomical defence traits, such as resin duct production, size, and density, were measured from increment cores using ImageJ. Growth characteristics, including ring width and basal area increment (BAI), were also assessed. Data analysis involved Pearson correlation tests to examine relationships between terpenes, NSCs, anatomical defences, and growth traits. Non-linear multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate chemical and growth data, while linear mixed-effect models identified significant relationships. Comparative analyses evaluated differences in anatomical defences and growth before and after outbreaks.","Core and wedge samples were glued to wooden mounts and dried for two weeks at room temperature. Samples were then sanded with belt and hand sanders using progressively finer sandpapers. Samples were then scanned at 1200 dpi to create high-resolution digital images. The annual growth (mm) was measured from the pith to last year's annual ring using ImageJ for all core samples. Calendar years were assigned to each annual ring by visual cross-dating ring characteristics, such as the width ratio and the colour contrast between earlywood and latewood per ring. This information was used for wedges to determine the year of death of trees killed by MPBs. The earliest death recorded was considered the starting year of the outbreak in a particular site. Among the five sites, two sites experienced an outbreak in 2014, and the remaining three sites had an MPB outbreak in 2015. Therefore, the healthy trees were separated into two outbreak years: 2014 (*n* = 24) and 2015 (*n* = 36). All samples for resin ducts were examined using ImageJ within a fixed sampling width of 10 mm. To analyse the resin ducts, the resin duct production (number of resin ducts per 10 mm width per year on a ring [no. year−1]), resin duct size (mean size of resin ducts per 10 mm width per year on a ring [mm2 year−1]), total resin duct area (sum of resin duct area per 10 mm width per year on a ring [mm2 year−1]), resin duct density (total number of resin ducts per year divided by the ring area (10 mm * ring width) for a given year [no. mm2 year−1], and relative resin duct area (percent area occupied by resin ducts per year within a ring area for a given year [% year−1]) were calculated for each core that had a diameter of 12 mm. The ring width (mm year−1) and basal area increment (BAI) (mm2 year−1) were used to represent tree radial growths. Tree radii and ring width data were used to calculate the BAI, assuming that tree rings are concentric circles. Tree radii were calculated by dividing the tree DBH by two. To study the long-term relationship between the growth and defence mechanisms in healthy pine trees, we analysed the annual growth and resin duct characteristics across three distinct periods: two pre-outbreak periods (5 years and 10 years before the outbreak) and one post-outbreak (from outbreak onset until 2019, when the last annual ring was formed at the time of sampling) period. We conducted Pearson correlation tests to examine correlations between terpenes (21 monoterpenes, six diterpene resin acids, total monoterpenes, and total diterpenes); NSCs (three soluble sugars, starch, and total NSCs); and five anatomical defence traits and two radial growth characteristics. The analysis was performed using R (Version 4.0.5), using the *Hmisc* R package. We selected the BAI to represent tree radial growths, as it strongly correlates with the ring width (Pearson correlation coefficient was > 0.96 in both the 2014 and 2015 outbreak years). In the analyses, we considered the overall as well as the total and individual concentrations of the constitutive monoterpenes and diterpenes. We employed an indirect gradient analysis to examine the impact of resin duct characteristics, BAIs, tree ages, and DBHs on the overall monoterpenes, diterpenes, and NSCs before and after outbreaks. We utilized non-linear multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity to ordinate monoterpenes, diterpenes, and NSCs using the vegan R package. The NMDS results were saved as RData files to ensure reproducibility. Subsequently, we projected resin duct characteristics from pre- and post-outbreak periods onto NMDS axes as environmental gradients and visualized these relationships using ordination triplots created with the ggplot2 R package. We followed the same steps when incorporating the radial growth characteristics from pre- and post-outbreak periods and the tree growth traits (age and DBH) into the NMDS axes for the 2014 and 2015 outbreak years. To identify relationships among defence and growth characteristics, we employed linear mixed-effect models, treating the site as a random effect and using the R package lme4. We visually assessed model assumptions, including the normality and homogeneity of residuals, applying transformations and rescaling as needed. The resin duct density and the percent resin duct area were standardized per 1 mm2 and accounted for the BAI prior to calculation. Furthermore, we investigated the relationships between the total monoterpenes or diterpenes and tree growth traits using linear mixed-effect models. When we observed a statistically significant relationship, we conducted further linear mixed-effect models with the site as a random effect to examine the specific relationship between individual monoterpenes or diterpenes and a particular predictor. In all cases, significance was determined at α = 0.05. We compared anatomical defences and radial growth responses across pre- and postoutbreak periods within the 2014 and 2015 outbreak years using linear mixed-effect models. The variability across sites was accounted for by nesting trees within sites. Furthermore, we examined the differences in tree age and DBH between the 2014 and 2015 outbreak years using linear mixed-effect models, where the site was considered a random effect to address any unexplained variances among the trees."
TA002480_R_0001,"The study investigates the legacy effects of mountain pine beetle outbreaks on lodgepole pine trees, focusing on chemical and anatomical defenses. It explores correlations between terpenes, resin ducts, and non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), revealing links between defense modalities and growth patterns. Findings highlight the complexity of post-outbreak resource allocation and defense responses.","Title: The Legacy Effect of Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreaks on the Chemical and Anatomical Defences of Surviving Lodgepole Pine Trees. Abstract: The recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks have caused widespread mortality among lodgepole pine trees in western North America, resulting in a reduced population of surviving trees. While previous studies have focused on the cascading impacts of these outbreaks on the physiology and growth of the surviving trees, there remains a need for a comprehensive study into the interactions among various physiological traits and the growth in post-outbreak stands. Specifically, the relationship between chemical (primarily terpenes) and anatomical (mainly resin ducts) defences, as well as the allocation of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) to support these defence modalities, is poorly understood. To address these gaps, we conducted a field survey of surviving lodgepole pine trees in post-mountain pine beetle outbreak stands in western Canada. Our retrospective analysis aimed at determining correlations between the post-outbreak concentrations of monoterpenes, diterpenes, and NSCs in the phloem and the historical resin duct characteristics and growth traits before and after the outbreak. We detected strong correlations between the post-outbreak concentrations of monoterpenes and historical resin duct characteristics, suggesting a possible link between these two defence modalities. Additionally, we found a positive relationship between the NSCs and the total concentrations of monoterpenes and diterpenes, suggesting that NSCs likely influence the production of these terpenes in lodgepole pine. Furthermore, historical tree growth patterns showed strong positive correlations with many individual monoterpenes and diterpenes. Interestingly, while surviving trees had enhanced anatomical defences after the outbreak, their growth patterns did not vary before and after the outbreak conditions. The complexity of these relationships emphasizes the dynamics of post-outbreak stand dynamics and resource allocations in lodgepole pine forests, highlighting the need for further research. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of conifer defences and their coordinated responses to forest insect outbreaks, with implications for forest management and conservation strategies."
TA002480_R_0002,"The study examines the fumigant toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against S. zeamais, showing dose- and time-dependent mortality. It identifies terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol as potent constituents and explores enzyme inhibition and gene expression changes in S. zeamais, revealing metabolic and respiratory disruptions.","Result: To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais. The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed. To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C). A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes). To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil. To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable."
TA002480_D_0001,"The study investigates the legacy effects of mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks on lodgepole pine trees, focusing on chemical (terpenes) and anatomical (resin ducts) defenses, as well as non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs). Strong correlations were found between post-outbreak monoterpene concentrations and historical resin duct characteristics, suggesting a link between these defense mechanisms. NSCs were positively associated with terpene production, indicating their role in defense allocation. Tree growth (BAI) showed positive relationships with individual terpenes, but no growth release was observed post-outbreak. Younger trees exhibited higher terpene concentrations, suggesting age-dependent defense investment. The outbreak enhanced resin duct traits, but no trade-offs between defenses or growth were detected.","We conducted a retrospective analysis of the constitutive monoterpenes and diterpenes, NSCs, and their interactions with anatomical defences and growth characteristics in surviving lodgepole pine trees in post-MPB-outbreak stands. We observed a strong correlation between post-outbreak concentrations of monoterpenes in the phloem and the historical resin duct characteristics in the xylem, along with a positive association between NSCs and the total monoterpenes and diterpenes. Despite finding no evidence of growth release (BAI) in surviving pine trees, we observed strong positive relationships between the BAI and several individual monoterpenes and diterpenes. Notably, tree age had a negative relationship with the monoterpenes. Furthermore, the outbreak enhanced the resin duct characteristics in lodgepole pine. Our analyses, however, revealed no relationships between the anatomical defence traits, BAI, tree age, size, and NSCs, nor did we find evidence supporting a trade-off between the monoterpenes and diterpenes. These findings offer valuable insights into our broader understanding of conifer defences, particularly concerning how anatomical defences interact in response to outbreaking bark beetle species. Our study showed strong correlations between monoterpenes and resin duct characteristics. Notably, the overall monoterpenes highly correlated with at least one of the five resin duct characteristics. For instance, the total monoterpenes were linked to the resin duct production, the resin duct size, and the total resin duct area. Furthermore, those monoterpenes that are crucial during MPB host colonization, such as (−)-α-pinene, β-phellandrene, (+)-limonene, and myrcene, had positive relationships with all resin duct characteristics, agreeing with our prior research findings [7,21,51]. Likewise, Kichas et al. [14] reported strong correlations between the resin duct area, resin duct production, and monoterpene concentrations in whitebark pine (*P. albicaulis*). In contrast, we found fewer relationships between the diterpenes and resin duct characteristics, suggesting a weaker association between them. Similarly, Mason et al. [22] reported that the anatomical defence traits of lodgepole pine differentially influenced the different classes of terpenes. Collectively, these findings highlight that the relationship between chemical and anatomical defences may depend on the classes of defence compounds [14]. This is in line with the conclusion from a meta-analysis, suggesting that trade-offs between monoterpenes and resin ducts are relatively rare across a wide range of plant species despite occasional occurrences in some systems [52]. Nonetheless, these results highlight the complementary role of anatomical and chemical defence structures in post-outbreak lodgepole pine stands, likely in response to the MPB outbreaks [7,8,20,22,39,41,42,53]."
TA002480_D_0002,"The study also found a positive relationship between NSCs and terpene production, supporting the idea that carbohydrate reserves fuel defense mechanisms. However, no such link was observed between NSCs and anatomical defenses, indicating gaps in understanding resource allocation in conifers. Tree growth (BAI) correlated positively with many terpenes, but growth release was absent post-outbreak, possibly due to resource competition from other species. Younger trees invested more in terpenes, suggesting ontogenetic shifts in defense prioritization. The outbreak increased resin duct traits, reinforcing physical defenses. The absence of trade-offs between defenses or growth underscores the complexity of post-outbreak dynamics, warranting further research.","The second contribution of our study lies in the evidence regarding the positive relationship between total NSCs and total monoterpenes or total diterpenes within the 2015 outbreak. Although such relationships were not consistent among the sites, this result suggests that the production of monoterpenes or diterpenes is linked to NSCs, aligning with previous research findings [29,30,33,54]. For instance, Mullin et al. [55] reported a positive relationship between the starch concentration and total monoterpenes and diterpenes in lodgepole pine trees across varying elevations. Generally, it is well-documented that terpenoid defences require substantial energy demands [32,56–58] and deplete carbohydrate reserves [29,30,32]. However, the absence of a similar relationship between anatomical defences and NSCs suggests that our current understanding of the connections between sinks (defences) and sources (NSCs) in conifers is limited and necessitates further field testing [30,37]. One of the strongest relationships we observed is that both the monoterpenes and diterpenes were positively correlated to the tree radial growth, as measured by the BAI. In fact, the BAI exhibited positive relationships with up to 65% of the individual monoterpenes, including (+)-limonene, (−)-α-pinene, myrcene, and β-phellandrene. Similarly, we observed a positive relationship between the individual diterpenes, including dehydroabietic, levopimaric, palustric, neoabietic, and abietic acids, and the BAI in the 2015 outbreak year. It is worth noting that the varying diterpene–BAI relationships between the outbreaks in 2014 and 2015 could be attributed to differences in pine density, as the pine density in the former was nearly double that of the latter. We observed negative correlations between tree age and the monoterpenes in the 2014 and 2015 outbreak years. Specifically, the age of trees was linked to approximately 45% of the individual monoterpenes in the 2014 outbreak and 40% in the 2015 outbreak. Notably, (+)-limonene, (−)-α-pinene, γ-terpinene, and linalool exhibited the strongest negative associations with tree age. These findings suggest that irrespective of the tree size, tree age may be an important factor in determining the allocation of carbon resources to defence mechanisms. It appears that as trees mature, the allocation of resources to defences becomes less of a priority, whereas younger trees may invest more heavily in defence mechanisms. This could be attributed to the fact that younger trees are potentially more vulnerable to herbivory and thus prioritize defence allocation more than older trees, as supported by Swihart and Bryant [59]. In the case of lodgepole pine, it was found that young trees in the range of 30–50 years old exhibited a greater resistance to ophiostomoid fungi carried by MPBs compared to both younger and older trees [60]. Overall, the relationship between the ontogeny of investment in defence versus growth in long-lived trees remains a complex and unresolved topic within this field of research [2,61]."
TA002480_D_0003,"The MPB outbreak significantly enhanced anatomical defenses (resin ducts) in surviving lodgepole pines, aligning with prior studies. Resin ducts serve as critical physical and chemical barriers against beetles. However, no growth release (BAI) was detected, possibly due to resource competition or alternative allocation strategies. The study found no trade-offs between terpenes and resin ducts, nor between defenses and growth, highlighting the complexity of post-outbreak dynamics. These findings underscore the need for further research to unravel the intricate relationships between defense mechanisms, resource allocation, and growth in conifer forests impacted by bark beetle outbreaks.","The MPB outbreak influenced various physiological and growth traits of surviving lodgepole pine trees. Firstly, the post-outbreak conditions improved the resin duct characteristics compared to the pre-outbreak conditions, with the resin duct size, relative resin duct area, and total resin duct area all increasing. This suggests that an increased investment in anatomical defences following MPB outbreaks, agreeing with the results of earlier studies. For instance, Zhao and Erbilgin [8] reported an increased resin duct investment in surviving lodgepole pine trees. Resins serve as the initial line of defence for trees against bark beetle attacks by providing physical and chemical protection [18,25,62,63]. The number and size of xylem resin ducts in pine trees can predict resin production in response to wounding or bark beetle attacks [36,37,39]. Pines that survive MPB attacks tend to have more and larger xylem resin ducts [8,41,42,53] and an increased pre-attack resin production [64]. Based on the anatomical defence and terpene duct characteristics observed in this and other studies, it would be expected that beetles would show a preference for larger pine trees. Finally, our study did not provide evidence of growth release (BAI) in the surviving lodgepole pine trees. Furthermore, we found no connections between anatomical defence traits and BAI or evidence suggesting any notable relationships between monoterpenes and diterpenes. These findings contradict those of Kichas et al. [14], who reported significant correlations between BAI and resin duct characteristics in whitebark pine and lodgepole pine. We suspect that the enhanced anatomical defences observed after outbreaks may have required additional resources to support their development and maintenance rather than growth. Alternatively, other conifer species, such as spruce, and understory woody plant species, like aspen, may have taken advantage of the available resources following the MPB outbreaks in this study, affecting the growth of surviving lodgepole pine trees. This suggests a complex interplay of factors influencing post-outbreak stand dynamics and resource allocation in these forest ecosystems, highlighting the need for further research to understand these intricate relationships fully. In conclusion, our retrospective analysis of lodgepole pine trees surviving bark beetle outbreaks revealed a complex interplay between chemical and anatomical defences. Strong correlations between the post-outbreak monoterpene concentrations and resin duct characteristics underscore the importance of these chemical defences in tree resilience, aligning with previous studies on conifer defences [7,14,21]. Although we observed positive relationships between the basal area increment (BAI) and certain monoterpenes and diterpenes, the absence of a significant growth release and the negative correlation between tree age and monoterpenes suggest balanced resource allocation strategies in response to beetle outbreaks. Despite the increased investment in resin ducts and a positive link between NSCs and terpene concentrations, no direct connections were found between anatomical defences and BAIs. These findings indicate that while anatomical and chemical defences are crucial, their interactions and impacts on growth remain complex and warrant further investigations to fully understand the dynamics within post-outbreak forest ecosystems [8,22,29,55,59,60]."
TA039446_I_0001,"The introduction provides background on agarwood, its cultural and medicinal significance, and the challenges of natural resource depletion, leading to the exploration of artificial induction methods, particularly microbial inoculation, to induce agarwood formation in Aquilaria sinensis.","Agarwood is a highly valuable dark resinous heartwood formed in Aquilaria species following lightning strikes, animal gnawing, or pest attacks. Due to its cultural, religious, and medicinal significance, the demand for agarwood has continually increased, leading to over-exploitation and illegal trade of Aquilaria trees, which resulted in its listing under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1995. To prevent the extinction of Aquilaria sinensis and to meet market demand, methods such as physical injury, chemical induction, and microbial inoculation have been used to artificially induce agarwood formation in A. sinensis. Compared to physical and chemical induction methods, microbial agents treeare considered to be capable of intermittently and continuously inducing agarwood formation. Many scientists have been dedicated to isolating various fungi from different parts of Aquilaria trees, and have confirmed that Trichoderma, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium, Lasiodiploidia are capable of inducing agarwood formation."
TA039446_I_0002,"The introduction explains the physiological and biochemical mechanisms by which fungi induce agarwood formation, including oxidative stress responses, activation of antioxidant enzymes, and upregulation of key enzymes in terpenoid biosynthesis pathways, leading to the accumulation of sesquiterpenes and aromatic compounds.","Fungi, as the key factor in inducing agarwood formation, stimulate A. sinensis to produce defensive secondary metabolites through intricate physiological and biochemical mechanisms. In a natural environment, when agarwood trees are infected by fungi, the tree recognizes the fungi invasion and activates its defense response, a process considered the starting point of agarwood formation. The core of the defense response lies in inducing stress responses through signaling pathways, leading to enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, triggering the expression of a series of disease-resistant genes, and ultimately resulting in the accumulation of secondary metabolites. These metabolites, including sesquiterpenes and 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones, are the main active components of agarwood. Fungi infection is often accompanied by oxidative stress responses in plant cells. Plant cells counter pathogen invasion by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anions (O₂⁻). To mitigate the toxicity of ROS, the antioxidant enzyme system within agarwood trees is rapidly activated. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Peroxidase (POD), and Catalase (CAT) are the main antioxidant enzymes involved, working together to eliminate excess ROS and maintain redox balance within cells. The enhancement of these enzyme activities is not only a direct response of plants to fungi invasion but also indirectly promotes the activation of secondary metabolic pathways related to agarwood formation. Under fungi induction, the secondary metabolic pathways within agarwood trees are significantly activated, particularly the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) are the key rate-limiting enzymes in the MVA and MEP pathways, respectively. The upregulated expression of these enzymes promotes the increased synthesis of sesquiterpene compounds. Sesquiterpene synthase (ASS-1) is a typical wound-induced gene responsible for sesquiterpene formation in agarwood. Studies have found that ASS-1 expression is barely detectable in healthy A. sinensis callus or cell cultures, but its expression significantly increases in wounded tissues or jasmonic acid methyl ester-treated callus, leading to a corresponding increase in sesquiterpene compounds. Fungi infection can significantly increase the accumulation of secondary metabolites in Aquilaria trees by regulating the gene expression of defense enzymes and these key enzymes, thereby enhancing the yield and quality of agarwood."
TA039446_I_0003,"The introduction discusses the use of Aquilaria sinensis callus as a model system to study agarwood formation, highlighting its physiological similarities to the whole tree and its potential for screening agarwood-inducing fungi, while acknowledging limitations due to its simplified environment.","The callus of A. sinensis is an undifferentiated cell mass induced from plant tissue through in vitro culture, and it shares physiological and biochemical similarities with the whole tree. The metabolic pathways and stress responses of callus tissue largely retain the characteristics of the tree, making it a common model for studying the formation mechanisms of agarwood. However, because callus tissue grows in a controlled environment, lacking the complex structure and environmental interactions found in mature trees, its research findings may require further validation and optimization when applied to actual trees. Therefore, we consider whether callus tissue can be used to screen fungi that promote agarwood formation. In this study, we selected the fungi W-1 and W-15, whose ability to promote agarwood formation was not previously established, and used the known agarwood-inducing fungi YMY as a positive control. We treated the callus tissue and preliminarily explored the feasibility of using callus tissue to assess the ability of fungi to induce agarwood formation, providing a new approach for screening fungi that induce agarwood."

TA039446_R_0002,"The ITS gene sequences of W-1 and W-15 were submitted to GenBank, and phylogenetic analysis confirmed their identities. Enzyme activity assays revealed dynamic changes in SOD and POD activities in callus treated with W-1, W-15, and YMY, with distinct patterns for each treatment. Gene expression analysis showed significant upregulation of HMGS, DXR, and ASS-1 genes, indicating activation of metabolic pathways.","Result: The ITS gene sequences amplified from strains W-1 and W-15 were obtained through sequencing and submitted to GenBank. The accession numbers for these sequences are PP508237 and PP508252, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that W-1 clustered with Podospora setosa, with a branch support rate of 99.00% (Fig 1). W-15 clustered with Alternaria alstroemeriae, with a branch support rate of 99.00% (Fig 2). In this study, the SOD activity in callus treated with W-1 and W-15 showed an initial increase followed by a decrease, with the SOD activity in W-1 treatment peaking at 457.36 U/gmin-1 at 48 h, and W-15 treatment peaking at 474.49 U/gmin-1 at 8 h. This pattern of change is consistent with previous studies; in contrast, the SOD activity in YMY-treated callus initially decreased, but significantly increased after 24 h, reaching a peak of 388.89 U/gmin-1 (Fig 3). This differing pattern of change may be related to the different active components or strains in the YMY fermentation filtrate. It is worth noting that the SOD activity in the sterilized PDA treatment showed no significant change, further confirming that W-1, W-15, and YMY all can induce changes in SOD activity in A. sinensis callus. In this study, the POD activity in callus treated with W-1 peaked at 220.50 U/gmin-1 at 12 h. In contrast, the POD activity in W-15 treated callus reached a maximum of 211.16 U/gmin-1 at 48 h. Differently, the POD activity in YMY-treated callus peaked at 4 hours, then decreased, but rose again to the highest value of 230.83 U/gmin-1 at 48 h (Fig 4). The results indicate that both fungi could significantly alter POD activity in A. sinensis callus. The qRT-PCR results indicated that after treatment with W-1 and W-15 fermentation filtrates, the relative expression levels of the HMGS, DXR, and ASS-1 genes were higher than those in the sterilized PDA treatment group and were similar to those observed in the YMY fermentation filtrate treatment group (Fig 5). Under W-1 fermentation filtrate treatment, the expression level of the HMGS gene initially increased and then decreased over the course of the experiment, peaking at 4 h, reaching 3-fold that of the control group. Under W-15 fermentation filtrate treatment, the expression trend of the HMGS gene was similar to that under W-1 treatment, also peaking at 4 h, at 2.5-fold the level of the control group. Under YMY fermentation filtrate treatment, HMGS gene expression peaked at 48 h, reaching 3-fold that of the control group (Fig 5A). The expression levels of the DXR gene peaked at 0 h under W-1, W-15, and YMY fermentation filtrate treatments, reaching 5-fold, 7.5-fold, and 6.5-fold that of the control group, respectively, before gradually decreasing (Fig 5B). Under W-1 fermentation filtrate treatment, ASS-1 gene expression peaked at 8 h, reaching 120-fold that of the control group, and this trend continued. Under W-15 fermentation filtrate treatment, ASS-1 gene expression showed a trend of rising, then falling, and rising again, peaking at 8 h at 130-fold that of the control group. Under YMY fermentation filtrate treatment, ASS-1 gene expression peaked at 12 h, reaching 70-fold that of the control group (Fig 5C). These results indicate that the metabolic pathways in A. sinensis callus were activated after treatment with W-1 and W-15, significantly enhancing the activity of related metabolic enzymes."
TA039446_R_0003,"GC-MS analysis of callus treated with W-1, W-15, and YMY for six months revealed significant changes in compound profiles, including increased sesquiterpene and aromatic compound content. Common terpenoid compounds with bioactive properties were identified, and the results confirm the agarwood-inducing potential of W-1 and W-15.","To further verify whether A. sinensis callus can be used to screen for agarwood-inducing fungi, the samples were treated with W-1, W-15, and YMY fermentation filtrates for six months, resulting in a color change (Fig 6). GC-MS analysis revealed that 231, 305, and 242 compounds were detected in the samples treated with W-1, W-15, and YMY, respectively (S1–S3 Tables). The content of sesquiterpenes in the essential oils treated with W-1 and W-15 was 9.76% and 16.69%, respectively, while the content in the control group was 10.12% (Table 2). Four terpenoid compounds were common to all samples: Dehydrofukinone, Alloaromadendrene, Cycloheptane, 1-ethenyl-1-methyl-4-methylene-2-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)-, and Squalene. Among them, Dehydrofukinone and Alloaromadendrene exhibit antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, while Squalene is a triterpene with various applications in the food, chemical, and healthcare industries. Aromatic compounds also contribute to the distinctive fragrance of agarwood. The content of aromatic compounds in the essential oils treated with W-1 and W-15 was 21.61% and 21.6%, respectively, compared to 16.66% in the control group. Benzylacetone, which has antitussive, expectorant, and antiasthmatic effects, was detected in both the treatment and control groups. The content of chromone compounds was relatively low in the essential oils treated with W-1 and W-15, at 3.07% and 3.17%, respectively, compared to 4.38% in the control group.

TA039446_D_0002,"The discussion emphasizes the importance of fungi in artificial agarwood production due to their economic and environmental benefits. It highlights the role of ROS and defense systems in plants under stress, referencing studies on fungi-induced secondary metabolite accumulation. The study's findings align with previous research, showing enhanced SOD and POD activities, upregulated gene expression, and increased sesquiterpene and aromatic compound content in A. sinensis callus treated with W-1 and W-15, confirming their agarwood-inducing potential.","Discussion: Due to the slow and unpredictable process of agarwood formation in nature, recent research has increasingly focused on the artificial production of agarwood through fungi induction. Fungi serve as natural inductors, facilitate the accumulation of agarwood in a process that is both economically feasible and environmentally sustainable. However, only 8% of the fungi isolated from Aquilaria trees have been investigated for their capacity to enhance the production of agarwood. Therefore, identifying fungi species capable of efficiently inducing agarwood formation is of great significance. When plants are under stress, it leads to an explosion of ROS that disrupt the plant’s internal balance. Plants signal through hormones and ions to activate the downstream defense systems, such as antioxidant enzymes and secondary metabolite synthesis. Finally, a large quantity of stored carbohydrates are synthesized into secondary metabolites, thereby assisting the plant in resisting stress. Zhu et al. used the endophytic fungi GG22 (Fusarium oxysporum) to treat Rehmannia, which increased the SOD and POD activities in Rehmannia, activated or enhanced the expression of related enzymes in primary metabolic pathways, and thereby increased the content of secondary metabolites. Changes in defense enzyme activity are often accompanied by the accumulation of specific secondary metabolites. In the process of agarwood formation, fungi infection induces the activity of antioxidant and defense enzymes, promoting the synthesis of terpenoids and phenylpropanoids, which are key aromatic compounds in agarwood. Similarly, in other plants, fungi infection can promote the accumulation of metabolites such as flavonoids, coumarins, and alkaloids by regulating the activity of defense enzymes. In this study, the activities of SOD and POD were enhanced after treatment with W-1 and W-15. The results showed that W-1 and W-15 can induce the necessary defense responses by activating the activity of related enzymes. In the process of agarwood formation, mechanical damage or other stressors activate specific genes and metabolic pathways, which ultimately result in the production of secondary metabolites like sesquiterpenes and 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone. The metabolic pathway of terpenoids has been extensively researched, but the biosynthesis of chromone derivatives has received relatively less attention. Sesquiterpenes are synthesized by multiple enzymes via the MVA pathway in the cytoplasm and the MEP pathway in the plastids. Liu et al. found that the fungi Phaeoacremonium rubrigenum increases sesquiterpene biosynthesis by upregulating enzymes in the MVA pathway of A. sinensis. Zhang et al. showed that methyl jasmonate and hydrogen peroxide can increase the expression of the SaDXR gene in Santalum album., thereby enhancing the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes. In this study, treatment with W-1 and W-15 significantly increased the expression levels of the HMGS and DXR genes in the callus tissues of A. sinensis. This upregulation might be part of the callus’s defense response to fungi infection, thereby promoting agarwood formation. The expression pattern of the ASS-1 gene was consistent with previous findings, showing minimal expression in callus tissues treated with sterile PDA but significant expression following W-1 and W-15 treatments. The experimental results showed that the activities of POD, SOD, and the expression levels of the ASS-1, HMGS, and DXR genes in the experimental groups and the positive control group were all higher than those in the negative control group, indicating that W-1 and W-15 have similar capabilities to YMY in inducing agarwood production. The effectiveness of these fungi in inducing agarwood formation was further confirmed by GC-MS analysis. The results showed a significant increase in the variety of volatile oil compounds in A. sinensis treated with W-1 and W-15, particularly in the content of sesquiterpenes and aromatic compounds. The sesquiterpene content in the W-1 treated samples was 9.76%, in W-15 treated samples 16.69%, compared to 10.12% in the control group. These results suggest that W-1 and W-15 can effectively induce agarwood formation. Moreover, the content of aromatic compounds in the W-1 and W-15 treated samples was significantly higher than in the control group, further confirming the effectiveness of these fungi in promoting agarwood formation. The results confirmed that fungi W-1 and W-15, similar to YMY, possess the ability to induce agarwood production. In conclusion, using callus tissue to assess the ability of fungi to induce agarwood formation is a rapid and reliable method. This approach not only enables the rapid determination of the ability of fungi to promote agarwood formation in the laboratory, but also contributes to the protection of wild A. sinensis."

TA041172_I_0001,"The introduction describes the complex process of wound healing, its phases (hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, remodeling), and the role of bacterial infections in disrupting this process, particularly by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, highlighting the need for new therapeutic agents like Achillea millefolium essential oil (AMEO).","Wound healing is a complex process consisting of four complex steps: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. The hemostasis phase of wound healing, comprising vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and coagulation, occurs rapidly. The second phase is initiated right after injury and consists of cell signaling, migration of different cells such as macrophages to the wound site, the cell cascade signaling process, led by cytokines, and finally fibroblast activation and proliferation, which leads to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the collagen structure. The final phase is the restoration of normal characteristics of the wound site. Various factors may interrupt or delay the processes mentioned above, and these include opportunistic bacterial infections. The clinical signs of an infected wound are topical pain and erythema, infectious exudate, and malodor. Infection in a wound caused by bacteria is the main reason for chronic wounds, which can lead to mobility disorders, multiple-organ dysfunction, and even more life-threatening situations. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the two most common pathogens isolated from chronic wounds."

However, chronic and non-healing wounds are one of the most common health problems worldwide and can often lead to disability or even mortality. Therefore, researching new techniques and drugs to accelerate wound healing is critical. In recent years, medicinal plants and their derivatives, such as essential oils, have been considered by researchers to be sources for the production of new agents effective in wound healing. Achillea millefolium, also known as yarrow, is a species of the Asteraceae family and has a long history of traditional uses in treating gastrointestinal disorders, hepatic diseases, rheumatic pain, pneumonia, and wound healing in several cultures across Asia and Europe. The anti-inflammatory effects of A. millefolium essential oil (AMEO), caused by the inhibition of proteases, have been widely demonstrated in several studies. GC-Mass analysis of AMEO identified several active components such as Eucalyptol, camphor, α-terpineol, β-pinene, and borneol.

On day 6 post-wounding, the wound closure rate was significantly higher in rats treated with AMEO 1% ointment (48.3% ± 4.02) compared with the negative control (33.65% ± 8.42) and vehicle groups (35.2% ± 7.44) (p < 0.01). On day 9 and 12 post-wounding, wound closure rates in rats treated with AMEO 1% (69.8% ± 4.7 and 78.45% ± 5.9, respectively) and AMEO 2% (62.95% ± 3.39 and 75.1 ± 2.17, respectively) were significantly higher when compared to those of the negative control group (50.31% ± 5.39 and 61.45% ± 4.45, respectively) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in wound closure rate between Eucerin (vehicle) treated animals and the negative control group on days 3, 6, 9, or 12 (Fig. 1). The results of the hydroxyproline assay are shown in Fig. 2. The hydroxyproline contents of tissue samples obtained from animals treated with AMEO 1% (170.4 ± 5.98 and 196 ± 7.6 µg/mg tissue on days 7 and 14, respectively) and AMEO 2% (171.6 ± 6.94 and 193.6 ± 4.636 µg/mg tissue on days 7 and 14, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those of negative control group (153.2 ± 8.87 and 164.8 ± 4.76 µg/mg tissue on days 7 and 14, respectively) (Fig. 2)."

The formation of the epidermal layer with more cell layers, the formation of epidermal protrusions and dermal papillae, the reappearance of skin appendages, and a reduction of edema and inflammation in granulation tissue were observed in samples obtained from AMEO 1%-treated animals on day 14 post-wounding. The histopathological study of samples obtained from the AMEO 3%, Eucerin-treated, and negative control groups showed no new epidermal layer or coagulum, as well as a reduction in edema and inflammation in granulation tissue. In addition, reduction of vascular hyperemia and accumulation of collagen fibers in granulation tissue was observed in these groups on 14 post-injury.

TA041172_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the significance of wound healing and the role of medicinal plants like Achillea millefolium in developing new treatments. AMEO's wound-healing potential is linked to its antibacterial properties against common wound pathogens, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The study emphasizes the role of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in AMEO, which contribute to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and collagen-stimulating effects. Increased hydroxyproline content and histopathological findings support AMEO's efficacy in promoting wound healing. The antibacterial activity of AMEO suggests its potential as an antibacterial wound dressing for chronic wounds.","Discussion: Skin wounds are the most common health issues people encountered throughout their lives, so developing new methods and drugs for encouraging optimal wound healing is essential. Medicinal plants and their derivatives can be used as an important source for developing potential new drugs effective for wound healing. In this study, we evaluated the wound-healing potential of Achillea millefolium essential oil in a full-thickness wound rat model. Considering that one of the main reasons for delayed wound healing is an infection caused by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, the in vitro antibacterial activity of A. millefolium essential oil against these two microorganisms was also investigated. The results of this study showed that AMEO at a concentration of 2% or less (with AMEO 1% ointment being the most effective concentration) has the potential to accelerate wound healing by attenuating the inflammatory response and increasing collagen synthesis and antibacterial activity. Achillea has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds throughout the world; and the name Achillea is derived from Achilles, the Greek hero who used yarrow to heal soldiers’ wounds during the Trojan War. The wound-healing activity of A. millefolium extracts has been evaluated in several studies, although, to date, no studies have investigated the effects of A. millefolium essential oil on wound healing. Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the most representative molecules of Achillea essential oil and each one of the evaluated monoterpenes demonstrated wound-healing properties. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are often associated with wound-healing activity. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and the most important component of the extracellular matrix. Considering that hydroxyproline amino acid exists exclusively in collagen protein, we measured the amount of hydroxyproline in the tissue samples obtained from the studied groups to estimate the collagen content in healing wound tissue from the different experimental groups. The hydroxyproline assay showed that AMEO 1% and 2% significantly increased the hydroxyproline content in tissue. These results seem to indicate that increasing collagen synthesis is one of the possible mechanisms by which AMEO can heal wounds. The increased collagen synthesis may be because of the presence of large amounts of terpenes in AMEO. It is likely that AMEO stimulates the migration of fibroblasts to the wound site and activates them to produce collagen. Increased collagen production in the AMEO 1% and 2%-treated groups was also confirmed by histological studies. Another important finding of this study was the antibacterial activity demonstrated by AMEO against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, the most common bacteria isolated from chronic wounds, which often form a biofilm resistant to many antibiotics. Co-infection with these two bacterial strains is a major challenge in the treatment of chronic wounds. Antibacterial wound dressings decrease the risk of bacterial infection during wound healing and prevent the wounds from becoming chronic. Based on the results of this study, AMEO has the potential to be used as an antibacterial wound dressing in combination with synthetic biomaterials."

TA049573_I_0001,"The introduction discusses the lack of FDA-approved treatments for cocaine addiction and highlights the potential of kappa opioid receptor agonists to attenuate cocaine-induced behaviors by modulating dopamine levels, though their side-effects limit clinical development.","Drug addiction is a relapsing, compulsive disorder characterized by a lack of control in drug intake even when adverse consequences are apparent. Psychostimulants, such as cocaine, are widely abused and currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments for psychostimulant addiction. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that kappa opioid receptor (KOPr) activation attenuates cocaine-induced behaviors such as cocaine self-administration, cocaine-enhanced locomotion, behavioral sensitization to cocaine, and the reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking. These effects of KOPr agonists can be attributed to their ability to decrease dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. KOPrs have been shown to form oligomers with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and this interaction was also increased in the presence of Salvinorin A (Sal A) and results in an increase in the dopamine uptake by DAT. KOPr activation in the ventral tegmental area also decreases dopamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex. These decreased dopamine levels within the reward pathways are likely responsible for reducing the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse. However, the side-effects of traditional KOPr agonists, such as depression, dysphoria, sedation, and aversion have limited the therapeutic development of these agents. Several strategies have been employed to reduce the side-effects profile of KOPr agonists, including the development of G-protein biased agonists and peripherally restricted KOPr agonists."
TA049573_I_0002,"The introduction describes Salvinorin A as a potent KOPr agonist derived from Salvia divinorum, its structural analogs, and the need for improved pharmacokinetics and reduced side-effects in developing anti-cocaine therapies.","Sal A, derived from the hallucinogenic sage plant Salvia divinorum (Lamiaceae), is a potent and selective KOPr agonist. Sal A has a novel neo-clerodane diterpene structure and shares similar pharmacological properties with the traditional KOPr agonists. Previously, we have reported that Sal A and the analogues, 2-ethoxymethyl ether Sal B and β-tetrahydropyran Sal B, attenuate cocaine-prime induced cocaine seeking without inducing sedation or suppressing operant sucrose reinforcement in rats in a similar fashion to the traditional KOPr agonists U50488, U69593, and spiradoline. However, Sal A has a rapid onset and short duration of the effects attributed to the quick metabolism at the C-2 position to the metabolite Salvinorin B. Sal A is also a substrate for the P-glycoprotein efflux pump. Because of this poor pharmacokinetic profile, Sal A cannot be developed as an anti-cocaine agent. Structure-activity relationship studies involving Sal A suggests the C-2 position is important in the binding and activation of KOPr by Sal A and is likely to be important in the design of analogues with improved pharmacokinetics. Recently, C-2 substituted Sal A analogues have been synthesized with varying affinity for KOPr compared to Sal A. Other pharmacological studies indicate that C-2 substituted Sal A analogues are longer acting. Therefore, developing Sal A analogues with anti-cocaine properties, improved pharmacokinetics, and fewer side-effects are desirable for the development of potential anti-cocaine pharmacotherapies."
TA049573_I_0003,"The introduction outlines the synthesis and properties of Mesyl Sal B, a C-2 substituted Sal A analog, and its potential to attenuate cocaine-induced behaviors and side-effects, along with the experimental approaches used to evaluate its effects.","The Sal A analogue (2S,4aR,6aR,7R,9S,10aS,10bR)-9-(methanesulfonyloxy)-2-(3-furanyl)dodecahydro-6a, 10b-dimethyl-4,10-dioxy-2H-naptho [2,1-c]pyran-7-carboxylic acid methyl ester (Mesyl Sal B) has a mesylate substitution at the C-2 position and has been shown to have similar binding affinity for KOPr to Sal A and U69593. We have previously shown that Mesyl Sal B improved the pharmacokinetic effects in mice, using the warm-water tail withdrawal assay, and attenuated cocaine-prime induced cocaine seeking/taking in cocaine self-administering rats. It has also been demonstrated that Mesyl Sal B attenuates the alcohol intake in mice following chronic escalation drinking. Single and intermittent cocaine exposure produces an increase in the locomotion activity and an increased locomotion sensitized response following a cocaine challenge in animals with prior cocaine experience. The mesolimbic dopaminergic system has been implicated in cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization and increased extracellular dopamine levels are observed within the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens of rats receiving cocaine. Since cocaine behavioral sensitization might play a part in craving and relapse to drug use, understanding the factors involved in attenuating behavioral sensitization to cocaine is likely to be useful for designing anti-cocaine therapeutics. Therefore, we tested the effect of Mesyl Sal B on cocaine-induced hyperactivity and the expression of cocaine behavioral sensitization in rats. Furthermore, Mesyl Sal B was assessed for the side-effects associated with the traditional KOPr agonists, U50488 and U69593, as well as the parent compound Sal A. In laboratory animals, Sal A produces sedation and aversion, therefore, we tested the effect of Mesyl Sal B on rotarod performance in mice, and conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and conditioned place aversion (CPA) in rats. Since Sal A produces depressive effects, we also tested the effect of Mesyl Sal B on swimming behaviors using the forced swim test (FST), anxiogenic effects using the elevated plus maze (EPM), and cognitive performance using the novel object recognition task."

TA049573_R_0001,"Mesyl Sal B is a novel Salvinorin A (Sal A) analogue with similar binding affinity and potency to Sal A at kappa opioid receptors (KOPr). It shows full agonist activity in both G-protein-dependent and independent assays, with a bias toward G-protein signaling. Mesyl Sal B effectively suppresses cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization in rats without causing aversion, sedation, or memory impairment. However, it exhibits pro-depressive effects in the forced swim test. While it has minimal antinociceptive effects compared to Sal A and U50488, it shows a longer duration of action in vivo.","Mesyl Sal B is a novel Sal A analogue previously shown to bind KOPr with similar binding affinity (Mesyl Sal B, Ki = 2.3 ± 0.1 nM vs. Sal A, Ki = 1.9 ± 0.2 nM) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the human KOPr, using [125I]IOXY as the radioligand; and similar potency (EC50 = 30 ± 5 nM) to Sal A (EC50 = 40 ± 10 nM) assessed using [35S]GTPγS functional assays in CHO cells (Figure 1). Data from functional cellular assays measuring KOPr-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation (DiscoveRx HitHunter assays) and in assays evaluating β-arrestin2 recruitment are shown in Table 1. Assays evaluating signaling bias compare the potency and efficacy of test ligands (Mesyl Sal B) against reference ligands (U50488) in both G-protein dependent and independent assays. Here we use the cAMP and β-arrestin2 recruitment assays to evaluate signaling bias and show that Mesyl Sal B is a full agonist in both assays, and furthermore, to show that Mesyl Sal B has G-protein signaling bias. Studies to determine the effects of Mesyl Sal B on cocaine-induced hyperactivity in rats are shown in Figure 2. Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) suppressed the cocaine-induced hyperactivity when administered 45 min prior to cocaine (Figure 2b). A time course of effects on suppression of cocaine-induced hyperactivity was performed between 5–60 min, with 45 min pre-incubation showing optimal effects (data not shown). The time-course analysis revealed a significant effect of Mesyl Sal B on cocaine-induced hyperactivity (F (3,168) = 23.64, p < 0.0001) at 5, 10, and 20 min (Bonferroni post hoc test; Figure 2a). The effect of Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) on the expression of cocaine sensitization in rats is shown in Figure 2c,d. Control cocaine-sensitized rats produced a significant increase in the locomotor activity on the test day (day 10) compared to the saline-treated rats indicating the expression of cocaine sensitization (F(3,23) = 6.15, p = 0.003). Cocaine–sensitized rats were given a single injection of Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) on the test day had attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures of time indicated a significant effect of treatment (F(3,276) = 25.39, p < 0.0001) and treatment x time interaction (F(33,276) = 3.84, p < 0.0001). Further post hoc analysis showed a significant effect at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min (p < 0.05) (Figure 2c). This data suggests that Mesyl Sal B suppresses the expression of cocaine behavioral sensitization in rats. No changes in stereotypic counts were observed between any of these groups (data not shown). Mesyl Sal B has previously been shown to have antinociceptive effects in the warm-water tail withdrawal assay in mice at 1 mg/kg, i.p. with a 60 min duration of action compared to 15 min for Sal A. Results from in vitro cellular assays show that U50488, Sal A, and Mesyl Sal B are all full agonists at KOPr, therefore, in the present study, the warm-water tail withdrawal assay was used to assess the dose-response effects in vivo. A non-linear regression analysis showed that a different curve fit each treatment (F(6,93) = 14.43, p < 0.0001) (Figure 3). Mesyl Sal B (EC50 = 3.0 mg/kg) only exerted partial effects in the warm-water tail withdrawal assay in comparison to U50488 (EC50 = 6.7 mg/kg) and Sal A (EC50 = 2.1 mg/kg). Interestingly, the efficacy of Mesyl Sal B (Emax = 38%) was significantly reduced compared to the traditional agonist U50488 (p = 0.0064), whereas Sal A (Emax = 87%) was not significantly different to U50488 (p > 0.9999). Therefore, it appears that Mesyl Sal B has minimal effects on thermal antinociception, with a reduced potency and efficacy compared to both Sal A and U50488."
TA049573_R_0002,"Mesyl Sal B shows limited effectiveness in attenuating nociceptive and inflammatory pain in the formaldehyde model, unlike Sal A, which significantly reduces pain responses and edema. It does not affect sucrose intake, indicating no anhedonia, and does not impair memory in the novel object recognition task. Unlike Sal A, Mesyl Sal B does not cause motor impairment in the rotarod test. It also lacks aversive effects in conditioned place aversion and conditioned taste aversion tests. However, it increases immobility in the forced swim test, indicating pro-depressive effects, while showing no anxiogenic effects in the elevated plus maze.","To fully evaluate the effects of Mesyl Sal B on pain behaviors, we utilized the intraplantar 2% formaldehyde model of phase 1 nociceptive pain (0–15 min) and phase 2 inflammatory pain (20–60 min) in mice. While Sal A (2 mg/kg) showed significant attenuation of the phase 1 and phase 2 pain responses (F(33,220) = 3.169, p < 0.0001) (Figure 4a), Mesyl Sal B was minimally effective at attenuating phase 1 at 2 mg/kg dosages (F(33,220) = 4.28, p < 0.0001), reducing phase 2 pain at the 30 min time point for the 2 mg/kg dose (p = 0.0009; Figure 4b). The lower 1 mg/kg dose of Mesyl Sal B dose showed a small but significant decrease at 10 (p = 0.0104) and 60 min (p = 0.0059). The limited effectiveness of Mesyl Sal B in this nociceptive and inflammatory pain is consistent with no significant reduction in the formaldehyde-induced edema, whereas the 2 mg/kg dose of Sal A significantly reduced the paw edema (p = 0.0426; Figure 4c). Reduced responses to pleasurable stimuli such as sucrose is a preclinical measure of anhedonia. The traditional KOPr agonist U50488 has been shown to reduce the sucrose intake and seeking at 5 and 10 mg/kg. We assessed the effect of Mesyl Sal B on sucrose-reinforced responding. Figure 5 shows that Mesyl Sal B at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg had no effect on the sucrose intake in male Sprague Dawley rats (F(2,18) = 1.113, p = 0.3501). Recognition memory has been shown to be impaired by stress and is also induced via KOPr dependent mechanisms and following administration of U50488. Figure 6a shows a decrease in recognition index times following U50488 (10 mg/kg/i.p.), that was prevented by the prior administration of the KOPr agonist nor-BNI (F(1.62,9.311) = 8.394, p = 0.0089). In contrast, neither Sal A (Figure 6b), nor Mesyl Sal B (0.3 or 1 mg/kg) (Figure 6c) produced any impairment in memory in the novel object recognition task. The rotarod performance test was used to assess the motor coordination of mice following an i.p. injection of the vehicle, Sal A, or Mesyl Sal B. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant interaction of treatment x time for the Mesyl Sal B experiment (F(12,96) = 0.1391 p = 0.9997). However, following Sal A administration, there was a significant treatment x time interaction (F(6,72) = 2.774, p = 0.0175). Sal A at a dose of 2 mg/kg showed a short-acting but significant motor impairment in the rotarod test in mice at 2 (p = 0.0005) and 15 min (p = 0.0039), whereas, Mesyl Sal B showed no motor impairment over a 90 min time period at either 1 or 2 mg/kg doses (Figure 7). To determine the effects of Mesyl Sal B on aversion, we used two behavioral models, CTA and CPA. In tests measuring conditioned place aversion in rats, U50488 caused significant aversion to the paired chamber (p < 0.05), whereas Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the amount of time spent in the drug-paired chamber (p = 0.767) (Figure 8a). Additional evaluation of the aversive effects of KOPr agonists utilized CTA tests in rats to compare the aversive effects of Mesyl Sal B with Sal A. Figure 8c shows the amount of novel tasting saccharin solution (0.1%) consumed by rats on test day with either Sal A or Mesyl Sal B pre-treatment and compared to vehicle-treated controls (F(2,16) = 0.1154, p = 0.8918). Acute exposure to Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) did not induce taste aversion in rats further supporting the absence of aversive effects with Mesyl Sal B. The FST measures despair-like behaviors. Figure 9a shows the effect of the acute exposure of Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) on forced swimming behaviors in rats. Mesyl Sal B pre-treated rats showed a significant decrease in the swimming time (p = 0.006) and a significant increase in the time spent immobile (p = 0.006) compared to vehicle pre-treated controls. This indicated that pro-depressive effects are produced by Mesyl Sal B in rats at doses that attenuated the effects of cocaine. Time spent in the open-arm during a 5 min test in EPM tests is a preclinical model of anxiety, with decreases in open-arm times consistent with anxiogenic effects. Figure 9b reveals that Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) has no effect on the time spent in the open arm (p > 0.9999) whereas Sal A (1 mg/kg), significantly decreased the time spent in the open arm (p = 0.0435)."

We assessed the antinociceptive, anti-cocaine, and side-effects of Mesyl Sal B. The anti-cocaine effects are evaluated in cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization to cocaine in male Sprague Dawley rats. Mesyl Sal B was assessed for anhedonia (conditioned taste aversion), aversion (conditioned place aversion), pro-depressive effects (forced swim test), anxiety (elevated plus maze) and learning and memory deficits (novel object recognition). In male B6.SJL mice, the antinociceptive effects were evaluated in warm-water (50 °C) tail withdrawal and intraplantar formaldehyde (2%) assays and the sedative effects measured with the rotarod performance task. Mesyl Sal B (0.3 mg/kg) attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization to cocaine without modulating sucrose self-administration and without producing aversion, sedation, anxiety, or learning and memory impairment in rats. However, increased immobility was observed in the forced swim test indicating pro-depressive effects. Mesyl Sal B was not as potent as Sal A at reducing pain in the antinociceptive assays. In conclusion, Mesyl Sal B possesses anti-cocaine effects, is longer acting in vivo and has fewer side-effects when compared to Sal A, however, the antinociceptive effects are limited."
TA049573_C_0002,"The discussion highlights the unique properties of Mesyl Sal B, including its G-protein biased signaling and behavioral effects. Unlike Sal A, Mesyl Sal B shows fewer side-effects but lacks strong antinociceptive efficacy. The findings suggest that KOPr-mediated effects can be distinct, offering potential for developing therapeutics with reduced side-effects.","Discussion: The activation of KOPr decreases dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, producing anti-rewarding effects. The psychoactive natural product Sal A is a potent and selective KOPr agonist isolated from the plant Salvia divinorum. Sal A attenuates cocaine-prime induced drug seeking in rats, however, Sal A has a short duration of action and is associated with negative side-effects, which has prevented its clinical development. The Sal A analogue, Mesyl Sal B, has a mesylate substitution at the C-2 position and has a similar binding affinity for the KOPr compared to Sal A and U69593. We have previously shown that Mesyl Sal B has a longer duration of action in the warm-water tail withdrawal assay in mice and Mesyl Sal B attenuates cocaine-prime drug seeking in rats. Therefore, we aimed to further assess the anti-cocaine effects of Mesyl Sal B, as well as the side-effect profile and any potential antinociceptive effects. We have determined that Mesyl Sal B has increased potency in vitro compared to U50488 in an assay measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, whereas, Mesyl Sal B has similar potency and efficacy to U50488 in an assay measuring β-arrestin2 recruitment. Together, this indicates that Mesyl Sal B has G-protein biased signaling in vitro. The behavioral effects of Mesyl Sal B in vivo are also unique. Mesyl Sal B was effective at attenuating cocaine-induced hyperactivity and behavioral sensitization to cocaine at similar doses to Sal A. In addition, Mesyl Sal B had fewer side-effects than Sal A and U50488 at the dose that modulated the cocaine behaviors. Mesyl Sal B produced no motor defects in the rotarod performance task; no memory impairment in the novel recognition task; no anxiety on the EPM; or aversion in the CTA or CPA tests. However, pro-depressive effects were observed in the FST. In contrast to Sal A, Mesyl Sal B was ineffective in behavioral models of antinociception. The cumulative dose-response effects in the warm-water tail withdrawal assay showed Mesyl Sal B only had a partial efficacy. This lack of antinociceptive efficacy was confirmed in the intraplantar formaldehyde model of inflammatory pain, where the effects of Mesyl Sal B were limited in comparison to Sal A. Overall, this study demonstrated that structurally novel Sal A analogues, such as Mesyl Sal B, have unique behavioral and cellular signaling properties, demonstrating that KOPr-mediated anti-rewarding effects, antinociceptive effects, and side-effects can be distinct. This holds promise for the development of KOPr therapeutics with fewer side-effects."
TA050772_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the global impact of cervical cancer, emphasizing the need for effective treatments, and introduces sclareol as a potential anticancer agent with unexplored mechanisms in cervical carcinoma.","Cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in women worldwide. In developing countries, it is the most common cause of cancer-associated mortality, and the five-year survival rate for patients with advanced cervical cancer is low. Thus, it is important to identify and examine effective drugs in cervical cancer treatment. It has long been reported that sclareol, a labdane-type diterpene isolated from the Salvia sclarea plant can inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of several cancer cell lines. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the antitumorigenic effect of sclareol in cervical carcinoma remain to be elucidated."
TA050772_I_0002,"This paragraph discusses the role of caveolin-1 (Cav1) as a tumor suppressor in various cancers and its potential unexplored function in cervical cancer, setting the stage for its investigation in the study.","Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is an important component of caveolae and is known to function as a scaffolding protein in the regulation of several signaling pathways. The loss of Cav1 has been demonstrated to be involved in the tumorigenesis of several types of cancer, and the overexpression of Cav1 has been shown to inhibit cell and tumor growth. Thus Cav1 is regarded as a potential tumor suppressor.

It is the most abundant anti-oxidant enzyme and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, although its localization in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and nucleus has also been reported. Previous studies have revealed that SOD1 is overexpressed in various types of cancer, and that the downregulation of SOD1 leads to cancer cell death, which indicates that SOD1 is important in tumorigenesis."

The cell death-inducing effects of drug treatment were measured using a CF488A-Annexin V and Propidium Iodide (PI) Apoptosis Assay kit (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). The samples and assays were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and then mounted onto slides. Images were captured with a Nikon fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Samples were collected with 1X SDS sample buffer and were separated by 10–12% SDS-PAGE (20 µg/lane). The proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Protein quantification was performed using a BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).

Following three washes with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.2% Tween 20, the blot was incubated with Dylight 680/800-conjugated secondary antibodies (cat. nos. 042-06-15-06 and 042-06-18-0; 1:10,000; KPL, Inc. Gaithersburg, MD, USA) in the dark for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was then washed again with TBST and images were captured using a Li-Cor Odyssey Clx infrared imaging system (LI-COR BioSciences, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). For the stable expression of Cav-1, the HeLa cells were transduced with Cav1-Flag lentiviral particles using ViraPower Lentiviral Expression system following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol, and stable cell lines were selected using blasticidin (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).

The immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer three times, resuspended in sample buffer and then subjected to western blot analysis. The cells were plated on coverslips at a density of 1.0×105 cells and transfected with the indicated plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000. HeLa cells and HeLa cells stably transfected with Cav1-Flag (Cav1) were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing lysosome-associated protein 2A (Lamp-2A)-EGFP. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-x-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Following rinsing with PBS three times, the cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore) overnight at 4°C.

TA050772_R_0001,"The study investigates the anticancer effects of sclareol in cervical carcinoma using HeLa cells. Sclareol significantly inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The upregulation of caveolin-1 (Cav1) and downregulation of SOD1 are identified as key mechanisms, with Cav1 enhancing sensitivity to sclareol and negatively regulating SOD1.","In the present study, HeLa cells were used to investigate the anticancer effects of sclareol in cervical carcinoma. An MTT assay was first performed to measure the viability of the HeLa cells. The cells were treated with sclareol for 24, 48 and 72 h, and cell viability was measured at each time point. The results showed that sclareol significantly inhibited the proliferation of the HeLa cells, and the inhibitory effect was time-dependent (Fig. 1A). In addition, when the cells were treated with different concentrations of sclareol, the proliferation of the HeLa cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Treatment with sclareol also induced the apoptosis of the HeLa cells. An Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/PI staining assay was used to assess the proportion of apoptotic cells when HeLa cells were treated with sclareol for indicated durations. The results indicated that the Annexin V-FITC-positive and PI-positive cells were significantly increased in a time-dependent manner when treated with sclareol (Fig. 1C and D). As the exact mechanism involved in the anticancer effect of sclareol remains to be fully elucidated, the present study examined the expression of various cancer-associated proteins to identify the potential target of sclareol. The cells were exposed to sclareol for 24, 48 and 72 h, and were then subjected to western blot analysis. The results showed that sclareol induced the protein levels of Cav1 in a time-dependent manner, compared with the control group (Fig. 2A and B). SOD1 has previously been identified as a novel cancer gene. The results of the present study showed that the protein level of SOD1 was significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner when treated with sclareol (Fig. 2A and B), and the decreased expression of SOD1 was negatively correlated with the increased expression of Cav1. The present study established a HeLa cell line stably expressing Cav1. The stable Cav1-expressing cell line and normal HeLa cells were treated with vehicle or sclareol at the indicated concentration for 24 h, following which the cell viability was measured using an MTT assay. It was found that stable expression of Cav1 enhanced the sensitivity of the cells to sclareol treatment (Fig. 2C and D). These results indicated that the upregulation of Cav1 was responsible for the anticancer effect of sclareol."
TA050772_R_0002,"The study further explores the relationship between Cav1 and SOD1, showing that Cav1 overexpression downregulates SOD1. Sclareol enhances the antiproliferative effect of bortezomib by upregulating Cav1 and downregulating SOD1. Additionally, Cav1 is implicated in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), potentially promoting SOD1 degradation via lysosomal pathways.","It was previously demonstrated that SOD1 is important in cancer development, whereas Cav1 has been reported to be a cancer suppressor. As shown in Fig. 2, the present study found that SOD1 was negatively correlated with Cav1. To determine whether the expression of SOD1 was directly regulated by Cav1, HeLa cells overexpressing Flag-tagged Cav1 were established, and western blot analysis was performed to determine the protein level of SOD1. The results showed that the overexpression of Cav1 significantly promoted the downregulation of SOD1 (Fig. 3A and B). In the HeLa cell line stably expressing Cav1, it was found that stable expression of Cav1 enhanced the downregulation of SOD1 when treated with sclareol (Fig. 3C and D). Previous investigations have revealed that Cav1 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. As the results of the present study showed that sclareol inhibited cancer cell proliferation through the upregulation of Cav1, whether bortezomib, an anticancer drug and a proteasome inhibitor, enhances the anticancer effect of sclareol was investigated. The HeLa cells were treated with sclareol only, bortezomib only or sclareol and bortezomib together, and subjected to western blot analysis and an MTT assay. By measuring the cell viability of each group, it was found that sclareol significantly enhanced the antiproliferative effect of bortezomib, compared with the cells treated with either drug separately (Fig. 4A). The results of the western blot analysis showed that the protein level of Cav1 increased following treatment with bortezomib (Fig. 4B and C). In addition, the HeLa cells treated with sclareol and bortezomib together exhibited a lower level of SOD1 and higher level of Cav1, compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 4B and C). Similar results were observed when other cancer cells were treated with the drug combination of bortezomib and sclareol (Fig. 4D). Previous reports have shown that Cav1 mediates the degradation of several proteins, thus it is possible that Cav1 promotes the degradation of SOD1. HSC70 and LAMP-2A are two important components of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The present study found that Cav1 not only colocalized with LAMP-2A (Fig. 5A) but also interacted with HSC70 (Fig. 5B and C), thus it is possible that Cav1 may be involved in CMA-mediated protein degradation. CMA substrates are usually delivered to the lysosome for degradation. In the present study, HeLa cells were treated with sclareol only or sclareol together with lysosome inhibitors and then subjected to western blot analysis. Of note, as with p62/SQSTM1 and LC3 II, which are two autophagy-associated proteins previously reported to be degraded in lysosomes, inhibition of lysosome activity suppressed the downregulation of SOD1 caused by sclareol treatment (Fig. 5D-G), which suggested that sclareol treatment may promote the downregulation of SOD1 through lysosome mediated degradation via Cav1."
TA050772_D_0001,"Sclareol exhibits antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in cervical cancer cells (HeLa) by upregulating the tumor suppressor caveolin-1 (Cav1) and downregulating copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). The study also shows that sclareol enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to bortezomib, suggesting a potential synergistic therapeutic approach.","Sclareol exhibits antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity against various human cancer cell lines, and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. The anticancer effect of sclareol has long been reported, however, the exact role of sclareol and its molecular mechanisms in cervical carcinoma remain to be elucidated. The present study demonstrated that sclareol inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, and the combination of sclareol with another anticancer drug, bortezomib, significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in several types of cancer cell. It was also shown that sclareol treatment induced the expression of Cav1 in HeLa cells. Although the role of Cav1 in tumorigenesis is controversial, increasing evidence indicates that Cav1 functions as a tumor suppressor in various types of cancer. The downregulation of Cav1 has been implicated in the development and progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, lung carcinoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, colon cancer, sporadic vestibular schwannomas and breast cancer. The overexpression of Cav1 decreases tumor cell growth and enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. However, the exact function of Cav1 in cervical carcinoma remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the upregulation of Cav1 correlated with decreased cell viability under sclareol treatment, which indicated that Cav1 may function as a tumor suppressor in HeLa cells. Cav1 is ubiquitinated and targeted to lysosomes for degradation, and previous studies have demonstrated that Cav-1 is also a molecular target of bortezomib, which is involved in antitumorigenesis and proteasome inhibition, and is degraded through the proteasome pathway. The data obtained in the present study showed that sclareol increased the protein level of Cav1, and the combined treatment with bortezomib further enhanced the expression of Cav1. Based on these findings, it is possible that the combination of sclareol with bortezomib may have novel synergistic antitumor effects via upregulation of the cancer suppressor, Cav1. In line with this hypothesis, the present study found that bortezomib synergized with sclareol to reduce the viability of various types of cancer cell, including HeLa, HepG2, MCF-7, SW480 and SW620 cells, whereas treatment with bortezomib or sclareol alone at the same concentration had markedly lower inhibitory effects. Thus, the combination of bortezomib with sclareol may be a novel and promising approach in cancer therapy."
TA050772_D_0002,"The study explores the relationship between Cav1 and SOD1, showing that Cav1 overexpression suppresses SOD1 levels, which may contribute to overcoming bortezomib resistance. Additionally, the study suggests that Cav1 promotes SOD1 degradation via lysosomal pathways, though other mechanisms may also be involved.","Previous reports have revealed the potential mechanism involved in the anticancer effect of Cav1. Cav-1 has been shown to prevent cancer growth via inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and to enhance the degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In the present study, the increased protein level of Cav1 was negatively correlated with the expression of SOD1, and the overexpression of Cav1 significantly suppressed the protein level of SOD1. These findings indicated a potential association between Cav1 and SOD1. The expression of SOD1 has been linked to the resistance of cancer cells to pro-oxidant drugs and the anticancer drug. bortezomib, which raises the possibility that an SOD1 inhibitor can be used, not only as an antitumorigenic drug, but also as a molecule to challenge the drug resistance of cancer cells. The data obtained in the present study showed that the treatment of HeLa cells with sclareol led to downregulation of the protein level of SOD1, whereas the overexpression of Cav1 enhanced the suppressed expression of SOD1. These findings suggested that sclareol may function as an SOD1 inhibitor via the upregulation of Cav1. As the first anticancer drug to function as a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib has been approved for the clinical treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, and has also been demonstrated to be an effective cell growth inhibitor in various cancer cell lines. However, the emergence of drug resistance has seriously affected the therapeutic effect of bortezomib. The overexpression of SOD1 has been shown to increase the resistance of cancer cells to bortezomib, and the results of the present study showed that combined sclareol and bortezomib treatment resulted in markedly lower protein levels of SOD1, compared with bortezomib treatment alone, which suggested that combined sclareol and bortezomib treatment may be a promising therapy in overcoming the challenge of bortezomib resistance. Cav1 is important in Derlin-1- and p97-mediated cyclooxygenase-2 ubiquitination and degradation, and previous reports have shown that Cav1 enhances the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR via endocytosis. However, how Cav1 promotes the suppressed expression of SOD1 remains to be fully elucidated. The present study found that inhibition of the lysosome rescued the decreased protein level of SOD1, which was induced by sclareol, thus Cav1 may interact with SOD1 to facilitate its degradation inside the lysosome. However, the protein level of SOD1 cannot be fully rescued by lysosome inhibition, which indicates Cav1 is not the only molecule to promote the degradation of SOD1 and that SOD1 is not only degraded by the lysosome-mediated pathway. Further detailed investigation is required to elucidate the exact mechanism involved. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the inhibitory effect of sclareol on the proliferation of HeLa cells. In addition, it was found that the anticancer effect of sclareol was enhanced when combined with bortezomib, which was demonstrated in various cancer cells. Further investigations revealed that the tumor suppressor, Cav1, enhanced the decreased expression of SOD1, which may be responsible for the anticancer effect of sclareol. These findings not only elucidated the potential mechanisms underlying the anticancer effect of sclareol, but also provided a novel and promising approach for cancer therapy and resolving drug resistance in cancer cells."
TA039996_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the medicinal importance of rhubarb, particularly Rheum tanguticum, its traditional and modern pharmacological uses, and the challenges in cultivation quality due to environmental variations, emphasizing the need for metabolomics to analyze differential metabolites and quality control.","Rhubarb is a perennial herb in the family Polygonaceae. Its dried roots and rhizomes are used as medicine and have been shown to be effective in purging heat, dredging intestines, cooling blood, detoxifying, removing blood stasis and stimulating menstruation. Rhubarb’s medicinal value has been documented in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) classics, such as Treatise on Febrile Diseases and Miscellaneous Diseases and Four Medical Codes. The results of modern pharmacological studies have revealed some of its other activities, including anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity, as well as its ability to lower blood fat levels and protect the kidneys. Rhubarb has been widely used for thousands of years in China and many countries around the world and has been included in the national pharmacopoeias of China, the United States, Japan and other countries. Rheum tanguticum Maxim. ex Balf. (R. tanguticum), one of the three “genuine rhubarb” species recorded in the Pharmacopoeia, is mainly distributed in Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai and other places that is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The climate and geographical characteristics of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau endow R. tanguticum with precious bioactive compounds. The distinctive pharmacological properties of R. tanguticum have made it widely popular in in the market. Due to the increasing market demand and the negative impact on natural populations, efforts have been made to cultivate R. tanguticum in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. This become an important source of revenue for farmers,, especially for high-altitude areas where agricultural outputs were low and options for income generation were largely dependent on natural resources.In contrast than wild products, the yields of cultivated plants are able to consistently meet market demands and protect wild R. tanguticum resources. However, the quality of cultivated products from different origins varies due to differences in geography, harvesting years, and processing methods. Xiong et al. studied the metabolites of R. tanguticum in canopy-covered and open habitats and found that different habitats and ecotypes result in differences in targeted metabolites. R. tanguticum grown in understory environments exhibits better medicinal properties. In another study on the composition of R. tanguticum from different sources, results indicated that R. tanguticum samples from Qinghai had higher levels of active ingredients than those from Gansu and Sichuan provinces. It has been suggested that the anthraquinone content of two-year-old R. tanguticum reached the standard of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. At three years old, the anthraquinone content was significantly higher than that of two-year-old R. tanguticum. Therefore, effectively distinguishing R. tanguticum from different cultivation regions is imperative for accurate quality control of its products. Metabolomics can be used to effectively address this problem through comprehensive analysis of plant extracts and lead to the overall evaluation of the quality of traditional Chinese medicinal products."
TA039996_I_0002,"The introduction further discusses the application of widely targeted metabolomics in studying plant metabolites under different environments, referencing studies on walnut, hickory, and aconite, and highlights the use of UPLC-Q-TOP/MS and multivariate statistical methods for identifying differential compounds in R. tanguticum cultivated at varying altitudes.","Previous studies have used widely targeted metabolomics to decipher changes in nutrient composition in plants grown under different environments. Li et al. applied wide-target metabolomics to reveal changes and the dynamic accumulation of metabolites in walnut and hickory seed coats, while Lin et al. accurately identified differentially abundant metabolites in aconite cultivated in Anxian and Jiangyou by using metabolomics. These differential compounds contribute to origin tracing and quality identification in aconite. With the widespread adoption of UPLC-Q-TOP/MS technology and its integration with multivariate statistical methods such as partial least squares discriminant analysis, metabolomics techniques can be better used to identify differential substances among samples. UPLC‒MS/MS is considered a feasible approach for the accurate quantification of the quality of R. tanguticum cultivated in different regions. R. tanguticum grows in areas at altitudes of 1800–4300 m, and the cultivation environment is closely related to its growth performance and quality. The soil, temperature, moisture and light characteristics prevalent during the cultivation of medicinal materials leads to differences in growth forms and in the chemical composition of target plants. Liu et al. found that high-altitude environments significantly increase the yield and quality of Pseudostellaria heterophylla. In another study, Nadeem et al. found a negative correlation between plant morphological characteristics, including height, stem diameter and leaf area, and elevation in ​​Podophyllum hexandrum Royle. Worku et al. analyzed the effect of altitude on the biochemical composition of Coffea arabica L. and found that caffeine and chlorogenic acid contents decreased with increasing altitude. Although there have been studies on cultivation techniques such as fertilization and density for R. tanguticum, as well as the application of metabolomics to explore differential compounds under different treatments, further research is needed to investigate the effect of altitude on the growth and pharmacological activity as well as metabolite profiles of R. tanguticum.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of altitudinal gradients on growth indicators and the active ingredient content of R. tanguticum. We employed widely targeted metabolomics analysis to analyze differentially abundant metabolites and enriched pathways in R. tanguticum across different altitudes and then applied a redundancy analysis method to reveal potential relationships among growth characteristics, active ingredients, metabolites and environmental factors. Through evaluating the phenotype and components of R. tanguticum, we can uncover its growth pattern at altitude. So as to achieve the goal of improving the quality of medicinal materials.Taken together, the results of this study provide a theoretical basis for evaluating quality and cultivation site selection for R. tanguticum. This contributes to the protection of wild resources, maintains ecological balance, and provides sustainable economic benefits to farmers."
TA039996_M_0001,"The study involved collecting Rheum tanguticum plants of varying ages from five different altitudinal locations in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau region. The plants were identified by a professor, and voucher specimens were deposited in a museum. Growth parameters, including aboveground and underground traits, were measured. The roots were processed into fine powder for composition analysis. Standard solutions for anthraquinones, tannins, and sennosides were prepared, and HPLC was used to analyze these compounds.","R. tanguticum plants, at four ages, were collected from five experimental sites, namely, Ledu (LD, 2016 m), Minhe (MH, 2180 m), Datong (DT, 2409 m), Huzhu (HZ, 2971 m), and Guoluo (GL, 3763 m), in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau region in eastern Qinghai Province, China. The age of plants used in this study ranged from 2 to 5 years as follows: 2, 3, 4 and 5 years in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The samples were identified as R. tanguticum by Prof. Guoying Zhou, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Science. The voucher specimens and their information were deposited at the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Museum of Biology, Chinese Academy of Science (QHGC-1813). In each sample, we measured 11 aboveground traits, including leaf and plant height, stem thickness, leaf length and width, leaf split length and width, petiole length, number of basal leaves, number of stem leaves and number of inflorescence branches. We also recorded root parameters, including length, diameter, fresh weight, and number, and used them to calculate the underground growth of R. tanguticum grown at different altitudes and at different ages. After the plants were harvested from the fields, entire roots were washed and cut into slices, which were subsequently dried and crushed into fine powder for composition analyses.All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines. Anthraquinone standards were purchased from the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (Beijing, China). Anthraquinone mixed reference solutions for aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol and physcion were separately prepared by dissolving the accurately weighed reference standards in methanol (≥ 99.9%) to yield concentrations of 0.0084 mg/mL, 0.08 mg/mL, 0.02 mg/mL, 0.14 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL, respectively. Tannin and sennoside standards were obtained from Chengdu Desite Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). Tannin-mixed reference solutions for gallic acid and catechins were separately prepared by dissolving accurately weighed reference standards in methanol (≥ 99.9%) to yield concentrations of 0.20 mg/mL and 0.26 mg/mL, respectively. Sennoside mixed reference solutions for sennoside A and sennoside B were separately prepared by dissolving accurate volumes of reference standards in methanol (≥ 99.9%) to yield concentrations of 0.28 mg/mL and 0.20 mg/mL, respectively.To prepare the anthraquinone sample, 0.15 g was weighed and placed in a conical flask, then 25 mL of methanol (≥ 99.9%) was added, and the flask was weighed. The contents were refluxed for 1 h in a condensation reflux device at 65 °C. The mixture was cooled and weighed again, and the lost weight was made up with methanol (≥ 99.9%). Next, 5 mL of the solution was admixed with 10 mL 8% hydrochloric acid after drying at 65 °C using rotary evaporation and subjected to ultrasonication for 2 min. Then, 10 mL chloroform was added, and the sample was refluxed for 1 h. After cooling, the extract was transferred into a separating funnel, partitioned three times with chloroform (10 mL each time), and then spin-dried at 65 °C. The residue was dissolved in 10 mL methanol (≥ 99.9%) and then passed through a 0.22 μm membrane filter.Extraction of tannins and sennosides and detection were performed according to our own laboratory method. Briefly, each sample was accurately weighed (0.5 g) and subsequently extracted with 25 mL 60% methanol (≥ 99.9%) for 1 h using ultrasonication (40 °C, 240 W, 40 kHz). After cooling, the contents were reweighed, and any lost weight was made up using 60% methanol (≥ 99.9%). Finally, the solution was passed through a filter membrane (0.22 μm) and stored at 4 °C until future use.Metabolite determination was achieved via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1260, Agilent Technologies Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) on a chromatograph equipped with a quaternary VL pump (G1311C), standard autosampler (G1329B), thermostatted column compartment (G1316A) and fluorescence detector (G1315D). The column was a C18 reversed-phase column (Agilent 5HC-C18, 250 × 4.6 mm), and the methanol (≥ 99.9%) and acetonitrile used in the mobiles phases were of HPLC grade and were procured from Shandong Yuwang Industrial Co., Ltd. (Shandong, China). The HPLC separation conditions for anthraquinone analysis were as follows: 0–25 min, liquid A linear gradient ranging from 42 to 45%; 25–55 min, liquid A linear gradient ranging from 45 to 80%. The column temperature was maintained at 25 °C at an analysis wavelength of 254 nm. The program for tannins and sennosides was as follows: 0–7 min, liquid A linear gradient ranging from 5 to 9%; 7–25 min, liquid A linear gradient ranging from 9 to 15%; 26–49 min, 15% liquid A; and 49–78 min, liquid A linear gradient ranging from 15 to 21%.

Metabolomics assays were performed at Wuhan Maiteville Biotechnology Co., Ltd on 4- and 5-year-old R. tanguticum plants grown in the LD and GL regions. All reagents used, including acetonitrile, methanol ( ≥ ≥ 99.9%) and formic acid, were of chromatography grade. Data were acquired on an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Mass spectrometry data were processed using Analyst 1.6.3 software, and the metabolites were qualitatively and quantitatively referenced against a local metabolic database. Integration data for all chromatographic peak areas were derived and stored.Climate variables were obtained from the WorldClim database (https://www.worldclim.org), which contains data for 1971–2010 at a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds. A total of 8 climate variables were extracted using ArcGIS 10.2 for each sample plot based on their geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). These included annual average air temperature (°C), annual average highest temperature (°C), annual average lowest temperature (°C), annual average rainfall (mm), annual average relative humidity (%), average water vapor pressure, average air pressure and annual average sunshine hours. We also obtained soil samples using soil augers from three depths, namely, 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm, with 3 replicates collected at each depth. These soil samples were analyzed for total N, available phosphorus and organic matter. The total nitrogen content was determined based on the semimicro Kjeldahl method using a nitrogen analyzer, available phosphorus (AP) was determined via the Mo-Sb colorimetric method, and organic matter (OM) was determined by the potassium dichromate volumetric method. Other soil factor data were obtained from the World Soil Database (HWSD) and imported into ArcGIS software for extraction of sample data, including soil pH, organic carbon content, soil bulk density, clay content, sediment content, soil cation exchange capacity, and electrical conductivity. We also recorded geographical locations for each sampling point using a portable global positioning system (GPS) device (Beijing Huachen Beidou Information Technology Co., Ltd).All data were statistically analyzed using SPSS 26.0 software and are presented as the means ± SEM.

TA039996_R_0001,"The study investigates the impact of altitudinal gradients on the growth and active ingredients of Rheum tanguticum, a medicinal herb. Results show that plants grown at lower altitudes exhibit better growth performance and higher yields, while total anthraquinone and sennoside contents decrease with increasing altitude, and total tannins increase. Environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, and soil pH significantly influence these outcomes.","BACKGROUND: Plant growth and quality are often affected by environmental factors, including geographical location, climate, and soil. In this study, we describe the effect of altitudinal differences on the growth and active ingredients in Rheum tanguticum Maxim. ex Balf. (R. tanguticum), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb known for its laxative properties. RESULTS: The results showed that plants grown at lower altitudes had better growth performances than those in higher altitude areas. The yield varied by 2.45-23.68 times with altitude, reaching a maximum of 102.01 t/ha. In addition, total anthraquinone and total sennoside contents decreased with increasing altitude, whereas total tannins increased with increasing altitude. The total anthraquinone content of the indicator compound reached 5.15% at five experimental sites, which exceeded the Chinese Pharmacopoeia standard by 70.87%. The content of the other two categories of active ingredients reached a maximum value of 0.94% (total sennosides) and 2.65% (total tannins). Redundancy analysis revealed that annual rainfall, annual average temperature, annual sunshine hours, and pH significantly affected growth and active ingredients. Moreover, key metabolites, such as flavonoids, amino acids and their derivatives, phenolic acids, lipids, and terpenes, were differentially expressed between samples from low- and high-altitude cultivation areas. These metabolites were enriched in the flavonoid and flavonol biosynthetic pathway and the monoterpene biosynthetic pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high anthraquinone content was observed in the lowest-latitude cultivation area due to low rainfall and alkaline soil pH. Key metabolites were significantly upregulated in high-latitude cultivation areas. These results provide a scientific basis for quality control and the systematic cultivation of R. tanguticum."
TA039996_R_0002,"The study details the interannual variability in yields and growth characteristics of R. tanguticum across different altitudes. Plants at lower altitudes showed superior growth traits, including height, stem diameter, and leaf characteristics. Root traits also declined with increasing altitude. Metabolomics analysis revealed significant differences in secondary metabolites, with flavonoids and phenolic acids being notably affected by altitude. Environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and soil properties were key drivers of these variations.","Result: The interannual variability in yields across the same test sites is outlined in Table 1. In summary, the yield increased with increasing age, except in Datong (DT), with the lowest yield recorded in 2-year-old plants (17.76, 10.84, 7.05, 3.64 and 0.75 t/ha). The value reached a maximum in 4- and 5-year-old plants (102.01, 78.87, 64.86, 42.84 and 41.69 t/ha), albeit with no statistically significant differences. Under the same age, R. tanguticum yield decreased with increasing altitude. Among the 5 experimental sites, Guoluo (GL) had the highest altitude and the lowest yield between 2 and 5 years, while the opposite was true for Ledu (LD). Profiles of the above-ground characteristics of R. tanguticum across different altitudes are summarized in Fig. 1. In summary, plants growing at low altitudes displayed better characteristics than their high-altitude counterparts. Notably, samples from the GL and Huzhu (HZ) experimental sites had significantly lower growth performance values than those from the LD, Minhe (MH) and DT sites. Five-year-old plants had a height of up to 229.5 cm, and their number of stem leaves and inflorescence branches also reached a maximum (Fig. 1B, K and L). Four-year-old plants displayed the highest stem diameter (44.6 mm), petiole length (60.5 cm), leaf length (75.6 cm), leaf width (79.2 cm), leaf split length (39.2 cm), leaf split width (10.3 cm) and leaf split number (5.1), although these values were not significantly different from those of 5-year-old plants (Fig. 1 C- 1I). Four-year-old plants in LD had significantly higher stem diameters than those from the other four sites, and those in GL were the lowest (12.16 mm) (Fig. 1 C). The stem diameter of 5-year-old plants from DT was significantly higher than that of LD, HZ and GL, although there was no statistically significant difference between MH and DT. Four-year-old plants had the longest petiole length (60.54 cm) at the DT experimental site (Fig. 1D). We found no significant differences in longest petiole length in LD, but the values were significantly higher than those in MH, HZ and GL. Five-year-old plants from the LD site had the maximum petiole length (47.2 cm), which was significantly higher than that of the other sites. However, we found no significant differences in petiole length between MH and DT. Profiles of underground traits, namely, root length, root diameter, root fresh weight, root dry weight, and root number of plants across different altitudinal gradients, are shown in Fig. 2. In summary, the root trait value decreased with increasing altitude for the 2-year-old sample. The LD experimental site had the highest root diameter and root fresh weight (40.14 mm and 0.44 kg), while GL had the lowest(15.12 mm and 0.02 kg) (Fig. 2B C). Plants growing in LD and DT had the highest root dry weight, while GL had the lowest. Notably, 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old samples from low-altitude areas (LD, MH, and DT) had better performance across the aforementioned 3 parameters than those from high-altitude sites (HZ, GL). Root number displayed a W-shaped trend in the altitude gradient from 3 to 5 years old, as evidenced by relatively high LD, DT and GL values and relatively low MH and HZ. In addition, 3- and 5-year-old plants at the GL site had significantly lower root lengths than those at the other experimental sites."
TA039996_R_0003,"The study highlights the variations in active ingredient content of R. tanguticum across different altitudes. Total anthraquinone content increased with plant age and was highest at lower altitudes, while total tannins and sennosides showed contrasting trends. Metabolomics analysis identified key metabolites, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, which were differentially expressed under altitude stress. Environmental factors, including rainfall, temperature, and soil properties, were found to significantly influence these metabolic pathways.","Interannual comparisons of total anthraquinone content for R. tanguticum are shown in Table 2. In summary, the total anthraquinone contents exhibited a consistent trend across the five experimental sites and increased with increasing plant age. The total anthraquinone content of 2-year-old plants was significantly lower than that of 4- and 5-year-old plants. We also found no statistically significant differences in total anthraquinone content between 4- and 5-year-old plants across LD, DT and HZ. Moreover, the total anthraquinone content of 3-year-old roots reached the pharmacopoeia standard (2020 edition) at all sites and showed continued accumulation during later stages of plant growth. Notably, the content in 5-year-old samples was 2–3 times higher than that in the pharmacopoeia standard (2020 edition). In summary, DT had the highest contents (5.15%), followed by MH and LD, while GL had the lowest (3.52%). To further understand the effect of altitude on active ingredients, we compared total anthraquinones, total tannins and total sennoside of plants across the five experimental sites with those in one year. The results are shown in Fig. 3. In summary, the highest contents of all three metabolites were recorded at low- and middle-altitude sites. The highest total anthraquinone content was recorded in plants grown in the LD and DT sites, while the lowest was observed in the HZ and GL sites (Fig. 3A). When the altitude exceeded a certain range, the content decreased with increasing altitude. On the other hand, the highest total tannin content was recorded in HZ (2.66%) (Fig. 3B), while the highest total sennoside content was observed in DT (0.94%), which decreased with increasing altitude (Fig. 3C). The content was the lowest at the GL site (0.30%). To assess whether altitudinal gradients affect the secondary metabolites of R. tanguticum, we employed wide-target metabolomics to analyze differences in root samples of plants grown at two experimental sites (LD and GL). The UPLC‒MS/MS analysis platform and MetWare self-built database were used to detect a total of 1400 metabolites in root samples, which were mainly divided into the following categories: alkaloids (8.07%), amino acids and their derivatives (8.71%), flavonoids (18.36%), lignin and coumarins (3.36%), lipids (10.07%), nucleotides and their derivatives (4.36%), organic acids (5.57%), phenolic acids (19.07%), quinones (5.14%), tannins (1.29%), terpenoids (3.57%) and others (12.43%). We performed principal component analysis (PCA) and found that the QC samples were located in the middle of the four groups, which closely clustered together (Fig. 4). Replicates of each sample were also clustered together, indicating that the analysis had good stability and reproducibility. In the PCA, the first two principal components accounted for 61.18% (Fig. 4A). PC1 explained 36.60%, and the first principal component could distinguish samples from different locations. PC2 explained 24.58%, and the second principal component showed differences between years. Metabolites could be used to clearly distinguish between samples from different years and sites, indicating that the secondary metabolites of R. tanguticum were different under altitude conditions. We generated a Venn diagram to depict the differential distribution of these metabolites across different groups (Fig. 4B). In summary, we detected a total of 593 differentially abundant metabolites across the four groups, of which 294 and 307 were differentially expressed in 4- and 5-year-old plants, respectively, in LD and GL. A total of 158 differentially abundant metabolites between the two groups indicated that they all responded to altitude stress in the two-year experiment."
TA039996_R_0004,"The study identifies key metabolic pathways and environmental factors influencing the quality of R. tanguticum. Flavonoid and monoterpene biosynthetic pathways were significantly enriched under altitude stress. Environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, and soil pH were strongly correlated with metabolite content. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which altitude affects medicinal herb quality and suggest strategies for optimized cultivation.","Next, we used K-means clustering to cluster the differentially abundant metabolites into 9 categories (Fig. 4C). Here, 3 subclasses displayed a consistent trend in changes between the two years. With increasing altitude, Sub class 5 showed a relative content increase, while the relative contents of Sub class 4 and Sub class 8 decreased. Flavonoids, alkaloids and phenolic acids were the most abundant metabolites in Subclasses 5, 4, and 8, respectively. Notably, tannins were found in Sub class 5 but not in the other two categories. A volcano plot of 4-year-old samples showed that 140 metabolites were significantly downregulated in the upper left area, while 133 were significantly upregulated in the upper right area (Fig. 5A). In 5-year-old R. tanguticum plants, 126 and 171 differentially abundant metabolites were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively (Fig. 5B). The significantly upregulated metabolites in response to altitude stress across the two years included flavonoids, which was consistent with the results of k-means clustering. Conversely, phenolic acids and lipids were significantly downregulated. Next, we subjected the identified metabolites to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to identify enriched pathways and found enrichment across three main categories, namely, metabolism, genetic information processing and environmental information processing. The larger and redder the dot, the more important it is for the signaling pathway. Figure 6 shows that metabolite pathways differentially enriched at different altitudes in the two-year experiment contained flavonoid and flavonol biosynthesis pathways and monoterpene biosynthesis pathways. The abundance score map showed that these two pathways were distributed on the right side of the central axis, and the line segment was longer, indicating that these metabolites were upregulated. The former enriched 7–8 differentially abundant metabolites (8 in 4-year-old samples of Figs. 6A and 7 in 5-year-old samples of Fig. 6B), and the latter was 2. These results indicated that the flavonoid and flavonol biosynthetic pathways played an important role in the plant response to altitude stress. A cluster heatmap of differentially abundant metabolites in the KEGG pathway showed that luteolin, isovitexin, vitexin and myricetin were negatively and positively correlated with LD and GL roots, respectively, while luteolin-7-O-glucuronide exhibited the opposite trend. Different altitudes were associated with different contents of secondary metabolites (Fig. 7A and B). The differentially expressed metabolites between years exhibited considerable overlap, which indicated the similarity in the anti-stress mechanism of rhubarb under different altitude conditions (Fig. 7). Next, we normalized the relative content of the five common components and then generated a pathway heatmap in combination with the biosynthesis of flavonoids and flavonols (ko00944) pathway. Notably, high altitude was associated with an increase in the content of flavonoids, such as luteolin, isovitexin, vitexin and myricetin, while that of luteolin-7-O-glucuronide decreased (Fig. 7C). Five overlapping differentially abundant metabolites were considered the key metabolites in response to stress. The index of active ingredients and the growth trait index were used as response variables, while climatic, soil, and geographical factors were used as explanatory variables for redundancy analysis. The data were standardized using the 'Center and Standardization' method, and environmental variables were analyzed using the 'Forward Selection' method. The results of the six models are shown in Fig. 8. After the replacement test, the selected variables and models were significant (P < 0.05). The corrected correlation coefficient R2 of climatic factors in the redundancy analysis model of active ingredients was 0.479, and climatic factors, including annual rainfall, annual minimum temperature, annual average temperature, and average relative humidity, had the greatest impact. The annual average and minimum temperature were negatively correlated with gallic acid but positively correlated with anthraquinones and sennosides. On the other hand, the annual rainfall had an opposite effect on the level of active ingredients (Fig. 8D). The correction coefficient (R2) for the relationship between climatic factors and growth indicators was 0.615. Climatic factors, including annual sunshine hours, annual maximum temperature, annual minimum temperature, and average pressure, had the greatest impact on growth. These indicators have positive effects on most aboveground and underground growth. The results showed that warm and rainless conditions mostly favored the growth of Rheum tanguticum (Fig. 8A). The correction coefficient for the association between soil factors and the secretion of active ingredients was 0.473, and soil factors, including pH, 0–10 cm available phosphorus, and 20–30 cm available phosphorus, had the greatest effect on the content of active ingredients. Soil pH and available phosphorus between 0 and 10 cm depths were negatively correlated with gallic acid content, while available phosphorus at 20–30 cm depth was positively correlated with catechin, anthraquinone, and sennoside contents (Fig. 8E). The R2 of the growth index redundancy analysis model was 0.452, and the soil factors, including pH, 10–20 cm available phosphorus, soil bulk density, and organic carbon, significantly affected it. Soil pH and 10–20 cm available phosphorus were positively correlated with leaf traits and root traits. On the other hand, organic carbon and soil bulk density were negatively correlated with leaf traits and root traits (Fig. 8B). The results showed that an alkaline soil environment was suitable for cultivating rhubarb. The correction R2 of geographical factors in the redundancy analysis model of active ingredients was 0.452, and important geographical factors, including longitude, latitude, and altitude, affected it. Altitude was positively correlated with gallic acid content and negatively correlated with the content of other active ingredients. Latitude was strongly and negatively correlated with the gallic acid content, whereas latitude was positively correlated with other active ingredient contents (Fig. 8F). The correction R2 of the growth index redundancy analysis model was 0.456, and the important geographical factors were longitude, latitude, and altitude. Latitude was positively correlated with root diameter and fresh root weight. Moreover, longitude was positively correlated with aboveground traits. Altitude was positively correlated with root dry weight and negatively correlated with other growth traits. The latitude and longitude variations have a significant impact on plant composition and growth (Fig. 8C). Although the latitude and longitude differences (in 'second') in our experimental sites are not at a high level, there are substantial variations in soil pH, precipitation, and other factors among the sites, which may potentially influence the research results. Therefore, future studies need to pay more attention to and address the latitude and longitude differences, and conduct relevant latitude and longitude gradient research to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which latitude and longitude variations affect the medicinal herb quality. The ecological factors identified using the previous redundancy analysis model and the differentially abundant metabolites present in the two-year trials based on the KO00944 pathway were subjected to redundancy analysis (Fig. 9). Samples collected from the same site and year in the two-year trial were highly similar. Annual rainfall, altitude, and average relative humidity were strongly and positively correlated with luteolin, isovitexin, vitexin, and myricetin content. Moreover, the relative content of these four components increased with altitude. Luteolin-7-O-glucuronide is a downregulated component in the pathway, and its content is positively correlated with latitude, annual minimum temperature, pH, annual average temperature, 0–10 cm available phosphorus, and 20–30 cm available phosphorus. In addition, the relative content of luteolin-7-O-glucuronide was also downregulated. The results showed that environmental factors significantly affected the content of the five components at GL. The effect of ecological factors on flavonoids further affected quality. These compounds played an important role in the synthesis of active substances and antioxidant activity."

TA039996_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the growing demand for Chinese medicinal materials and the need for high-quality cultivars. It emphasizes the role of environmental factors in plant growth and metabolite accumulation, with altitude affecting phenological periods and UV radiation influencing leaf size. Soil conditions and previous crops also impact metabolite content. The study validates the influence of environmental factors via redundancy analysis, showing that sunshine and temperature improve growth, while rainfall negatively affects active ingredients. Metabolomics reveals that phenolic acids, flavonoids, and lipids are enriched in specific pathways, with their accumulation linked to climatic conditions. These findings suggest that anthraquinones in high-altitude areas may have lower laxative but higher antioxidant qualities.","The gap between the growing demand for Chinese medicinal materials and the supply of medicinal resources has been one of the bottlenecks in the development of the Chinese medicine industry. Developing and planting high-quality cultivars may be the most efficient approach to solve this dilemma. However, studies investigating the ecological requirements of R. Tanguticum are scarce. Plant growth traits play a significant role in determining the yield and quality of herbs. Therefore, understanding changes in different localities and years could reveal the inherent trends in plant growth and quality. Habitat is closely related to plant size, number, and resource allocation. Previous research has shown that growth parameters, including height, leaf length, and leaf width growth, decrease with altitude. For example, the rhizome of Coptis chinensis Franch is longer at low altitudes (2300 m) than at high altitudes (2600 m, 2700 m), consistent with our findings. Root biomass decreases with an increase in altitude. Additionally, roots are morphologically very diverse. The roots in plants grown in GL were small and had many lateral roots, whereas the roots in HZ were larger, with smooth and clear differentiation between main and lateral roots. Second, the aboveground parts of R. tanguticum in low-altitude areas varied from those in high altitudes. Altitude affects the phenological period of plants. We found that later growth and development were higher at higher altitudes than at lower altitudes. This explains the missing data for plant height and stem thickness at HZ and GL in 3-year-old plants. Overall, in our research, aboveground growth was better at low altitudes than at high altitudes. Previous studies have shown that high UV rays may be a major contributor to harsh environmental factors at high altitudes. The small size of R. tanguticum leaves at higher altitudes could be attributed to high UV radiation, which may have influenced transpiration-driven water loss.The quality of Chinese medicinal materials is affected by cultivation methods and environmental conditions, resulting in different syntheses and the accumulation of secondary metabolites. Different types and contents of secondary metabolites are responsible for the varying quality of Chinese medicinal materials. Our results showed that the lowest anthraquinone content was at the GL site, and the highest content was at the LD or DT site in different years. However, the DT experimental site did not conform to this pattern, where the content decreased with increasing altitude, which could be attributed to soil fertility and the previous crop. The decomposition products negatively or positively affect the subsequent crops. For example, the total alkaloid content of Ephedra saxatilis was found to be higher than that of Ephedra gerardiana with an increase in soil moisture and temperature. Conversely, when the soil moisture was lower, both Ephedra species exhibited higher alkaloid content. Therefore, it can be concluded that high altitude combined with water deficit conditions may be more favorable for Ephedra in producing higher amounts of alkaloids. Moreover, our study revealed that the contents of sennoside components decreased with increasing altitude. The tannin content was highest at HZ across seasons, suggesting that the content was higher at high altitudes and lower at middle and low altitudes, consistent with previous studies on rhubarb. Yan et al. also showed that the contents of anthraquinone and tannins were highest at 1400–1700 m. This result was contrary to our findings, and the reason may be that the altitude range in the previous study was below our lowest altitude, which possibly limited the increase in active ingredients beyond a certain altitude. Similar findings have been reported in Gentiana cras-sicaulis Duthie ex Burk. The four ingredients followed a bell-shaped distribution within the altitudinal range of 2264–3100 m. The anthraquinone, total tannin, and total sennoside contents increased with age and peaked at 4 or 5 years old, after which no significant difference was observed between these two ages. The results of other studies showed that the best harvest period for R. tanguticum based on the content of the main functional component was over four years.Plants alter their tissue structure and chemical composition to regulate their responses to external stimuli. Our study validated the influence of environmental factors on plant growth characteristics and ingredient content via redundancy analysis (RDA). An increase in sunshine days and the average annual temperature improved the growth of R. tanguticum. Rainfall was negatively correlated with the content of effective components, consistent with a previous study. These results showed that the region with a high level of sunshine and low precipitation was conducive to the formation and accumulation of anthraquinone. Soil is the basic material for plant growth and development and for nutrient acquisition. Soil pH and 10–20 cm available P promoted leaf and root growth, while organic carbon and soil bulk density had the opposite effect. Our results show that R. tanguticum planted at low altitudes has higher quality and yield. The chemical characteristics of soil microenvironments, such as pH value and organic matter content, can influence nutrient availability and soil enzyme activity. The microbial communities in soil microenvironments play a crucial role in organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. These factors cannot be compensated for by a gridded dataset. Therefore, it is necessary for us to conduct further research in order to uncover the characteristics, regulatory mechanisms, and ecological functions of soil microenvironments in the future.Along various altitudes, environmental conditions vary significantly, which might influence plant performance and distribution. As a result of adaptive plant strategies, plants regulate their growth and development in response to abiotic stresses through primary and secondary metabolism. The metabolomics results showed that R. tanguticum contains phenolic acids, flavonoids, alkaloids, quinones, and lipids, which have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and immunomodulatory properties. Along the altitudinal gradient, differentially abundant metabolites were enriched in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and flavonols and the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway. The number of differentially abundant metabolites was higher in the former and most of which were abundant in the GL experimental site, which may have an important effect on the quality of the plants. The high content of lipids and phenolic acids in LD endowed R. tanguticum at lower altitudes with a unique quality. Metabolites were linked to climatic and other factors. Altitude, annual rainfall, and average relative humidity were higher in GL, and these environmental factors affected isovitexin, vitexin, myricetin, and luteolin production. These metabolites have antioxidant, hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and other pharmacological effects. However, annual rainfall and average relative humidity were negatively correlated with anthraquinone contents. Therefore, it can be inferred that anthraquinones dominating high-altitude areas have lower laxative qualities but higher antioxidant qualities. Consistent with our results, the flavonoid content of Agriophyllum squarrosum was strongly and positively correlated with precipitation. On the other hand, the flavonoids of Agriophyllum squarrosum were negatively correlated with temperature, suggesting that the accumulation of flavonoids may result from adaptation to environmental heterogeneity."
TA039996_C_0001,"The study investigates the impact of altitude on the growth and active ingredients of Rheum tanguticum, a medicinal herb. Results show that plants at lower altitudes exhibit better growth and higher yields, while active ingredients like anthraquinones and sennosides decrease with altitude, and tannins increase. Environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, and soil pH significantly influence these variations. Metabolomics analysis reveals differential expression of key metabolites like flavonoids and terpenes between low- and high-altitude areas, enriched in specific biosynthetic pathways.","Title: Metabolomics analysis reveals the metabolite profiles of Rheum tanguticum grown under different altitudinal gradients. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Plant growth and quality are often affected by environmental factors, including geographical location, climate, and soil. In this study, we describe the effect of altitudinal differences on the growth and active ingredients in Rheum tanguticum Maxim. ex Balf. (R. tanguticum), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb known for its laxative properties. RESULTS: The results showed that plants grown at lower altitudes had better growth performances than those in higher altitude areas. The yield varied by 2.45-23.68 times with altitude, reaching a maximum of 102.01 t/ha. In addition, total anthraquinone and total sennoside contents decreased with increasing altitude, whereas total tannins increased with increasing altitude. The total anthraquinone content of the indicator compound reached 5.15% at five experimental sites, which exceeded the Chinese Pharmacopoeia standard by 70.87%. The content of the other two categories of active ingredients reached a maximum value of 0.94% (total sennosides) and 2.65% (total tannins). Redundancy analysis revealed that annual rainfall, annual average temperature, annual sunshine hours, and pH significantly affected growth and active ingredients. Moreover, key metabolites, such as flavonoids, amino acids and their derivatives, phenolic acids, lipids, and terpenes, were differentially expressed between samples from low- and high-altitude cultivation areas. These metabolites were enriched in the flavonoid and flavonol biosynthetic pathway and the monoterpene biosynthetic pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high anthraquinone content was observed in the lowest-latitude cultivation area due to low rainfall and alkaline soil pH. Key metabolites were significantly upregulated in high-latitude cultivation areas. These results provide a scientific basis for quality control and the systematic cultivation of R. tanguticum."
TA039996_C_0002,"The discussion elaborates on the findings, emphasizing the influence of altitude and environmental factors on R. tanguticum's growth and active ingredients. Low-altitude sites favored better growth traits, while variations in active ingredients were linked to geographical and environmental variables like precipitation, temperature, and soil pH. The study highlights the importance of site selection for cultivation, with low precipitation and alkaline soil pH contributing to higher anthraquinone content at low latitudes, and flavonoid content being higher at high altitudes.","Discussion: The present study analyzed the growth traits and active ingredients of R. tanguticum at different ages at the five altitudinal gradient sites via a widely targeted metabolomics and RDA approach. Our data indicated that above- and underground growth traits showed better properties in low-altitude sites. Additionally, extracts from R. tanguticum showed variations among sites and plant ages. Redundancy analyses revealed that the variations in R. tanguticum might be related to geographical location (latitude, longitude, and altitude) and environmental variables (climate and soil). Among them, annual precipitation, annual average temperature, and soil pH were prominent factors influencing differences in active ingredient contents and growth traits in R. tanguticum. The most critical reason for the high content of anthraquinones in low-latitude sites may be the low precipitation and slightly basic soil pH. This was also the reason why flavonoid contents were higher at high-altitude sites than at low-altitude sites (Fig. 10). Furthermore, our study results are significant for informing site selection and the systematic cultivation of R. tanguticum."
TA043295_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the use of chemical defenses in nature, focusing on cantharidin (CTD), a terpene exclusively produced by Meloidae and Oedemeridae, and its role in deterring predators, attracting canthariphilous species, and its historical pharmacological applications.","Many organisms use chemical compounds as a defense against potential predators and parasites. Some species do not produce these compounds themselves but can sequester secondary chemicals from other organisms. Even though most of these interspecific interactions have been observed in phytophagous insects sequestering chemicals from their host plants, a greater diversity of interaction pathways exists in nature. Cantharidin (CTD) is a secondary chemical exclusively produced by two families in Tenebrionoidea: blister beetles (Coleoptera: Meloidae) and false blister beetles (Coleoptera: Oedemeridae). This toxic terpene acts as a strong feeding deterrent against potential predators and parasites of CTD producers in all phases of their development. It is also used as a nuptial gift in some species, although such function seems negligible, at least in some Oedemeridae. Despite its renowned high toxicity, popular pharmacology of different ancient cultures has traditionally used CTD for many purposes for more than two millennia, and because of its antitumoral properties, scientific interest in CTD has been renewed in the last decades."
TA043295_I_0002,"The introduction discusses the phenomenon of canthariphily, where arthropods are attracted to or sequester cantharidin, with over 300 species identified, primarily in Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Hemiptera, and explores its ecological significance in Anthicidae and Pyrochroidae, where CTD plays a role in sexual selection.","Of note, several arthropod species, collectively named ‘canthariphilous species’, are attracted to CTD, and some of these can sequester this compound from CTD-producing beetles. More than 300 canthariphilous species have been recorded in several orders of Hexapoda (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera), and one case has been reported in Opiliones. However, most canthariphilous species have been identified just because they are attracted to either CTD-baited traps or individuals of Meloidae and Oedemeridae (e.g.,) or because CTD was detected in their body (e.g.,); thus, the ecological significance of canthariphily for most of these remains unknown. Canthariphily is well represented among species of antlike flower beetles (Coleoptera: Anthicidae) and fire-coloured beetles (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae), which represent the most phylogenetically related groups to the CTD-producing family of Meloidae. The ecological significance of canthariphily in these two families has been investigated in more detail than in others, although only on a few species. Indeed, in these families, it has been demonstrated that CTD plays a crucial role in sexual selection: males sequestering CTD are positively selected by females for mating. Males of Anthicidae and Pyrochroidae have peculiar ‘test-organs’, involved in CTD secretion, which they show to females during courtship. Moreover, during mating, males can pass CTD to females, which, in turn, can transfer the chemical to the eggs."
TA043295_I_0003,"The introduction presents the first documented case of canthariphily in Cleridae, focusing on Tilloidea transversalis, a phytophagous checkered beetle observed interacting with the blister beetle Lydus trimaculatus, and outlines the research objectives to explore CTD sequestration and behavioral responses.","In this paper, we focus on the first-ever description of canthariphilous interactions between a checkered beetle species (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and a CTD-producing species. Scientific literature concerning canthariphily in Cleridae is scarce, limited to only two individuals of Cymatodera sp. from Mexico and individuals of three East African species (Pallenothriocera rufimembris Pic, 1949 and other two unidentified species) collected in CTD traps. Moreover, hypothesized the presence of CTD-secreting glands in males of P. rufimembris, but the authors themselves asserted that their hypotheses needed further investigations. Besides, CTD has been detected in Trichodes apiarius (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) even though this species has never been collected in CTD traps. Trichodes apiarius is a generalist omnivore species, also feeding on blister beetles and false blister beetles, that probably evolved a tolerance to CTD as observed in other generalist predators of insects. Thus, up to date, T. apiarius is not considered a canthariphilous species. The checkered beetle Tilloidea transversalis (Charpentier, 1825) (Coleoptera: Cleridae), contrary to most checkered beetles, is a phytophagous species, feeding primarily on some genera of Apiaceae and Asteraceae. An unexpected field observation of interspecific interactions between T. transversalis and Lydus trimaculatus (Fabricius, 1775) (Coleoptera: Meloidae) triggered our research, aimed at exploring the possible existence of canthariphilous behavior in this species of Cleridae. Our observational, behavioral, and chemical data contribute to shed light on the evolution of canthariphily in Cleridae and, more generally, in canthariphilous species."
TA043295_M_0001,"Specimens of Tilloidea transversalis and other beetle species were collected from pastures in Italy. Behavioral experiments were conducted in Petri dishes to observe interactions between T. transversalis and other beetles, including Lydus trimaculatus. The beetles were kept alive in fauna boxes and fed with flowers from their collection site.","All specimens were collected in derived pastures within Quercus woodlands at the western base of the Tolfa Mountains (Italy, Lazio, Roma, Tolfa, Rio Fiume valley, 42.053816N, 11.936530E, 28 m a.s.l.). Specimens of Tilloidea transversalis (Coleoptera: Cleridae) were hand-collected while feeding on capitula of Cynara cardunculus Linnaeus, 1753 in July 2020 (N = 133 individuals for behavioral analysis). In the same area and period, beetles from six locally abundant species of different families were also collected to perform behavioral experiments on the interspecific interactions of T. transversalis: Larinus cynarae (Fabricius, 1787) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Lydus trimaculatus (Coleoptera: Meloidae), Oedemera flavipes (Fabricius, 1792) (Coleoptera: Oedemeridae), Oxythyrea funesta (Poda, 1761) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), Rhagonycha fulva (Scopoli, 1763) (Coleoptera: Cantharidae), Stictoleptura cordigera (Fussli, 1775) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). All collected specimens (N = 7 individuals for each species except for L. trimaculatus: N = 14) were kept alive at room temperature in fauna boxes (28 × 20 × 14 cm), where species were reared separately and fed with the same flowers on which they were collected. After the experiments, all the surviving specimens were returned to the sampling area. Furthermore, additional specimens of T. transversalis (N = 32 males and N = 18 females) and L. trimaculatus (N = 32) were collected on 23rd June 2021 to perform chemical analyses. After field observation, laboratory-based behavioral experiments were conducted to verify if, beyond L. trimaculatus, T. transversalis was attracted to other beetles co-occurring in the sampled area (Table 1). Experiments were staged in Petri dishes (90 × 20 mm) whose inner bottom was covered with a paper disc to provide a suitable substrate for insect locomotion. Three specimens of T. transversalis (‘recipient’) were placed on the dish. After 5 min of acclimatization, experiments started with the placement of an individual from one of the abovementioned beetle species (‘source’) on the dish. Interactions were observed for 5 min. Seven replicates were performed for each species, using new individuals each time. An additional set of seven replicates was performed to record the duration of the biting time of T. transversalis into L. trimaculatus. Potential differences in the attack rate of T. transversalis against the other species were tested using a Chi-square test."
TA043295_M_0002,"Chemical analyses were performed to assess whether T. transversalis sequesters cantharidin (CTD) from L. trimaculatus. Specimens were divided into treated and control groups, with the treated group exposed to L. trimaculatus. After 24 hours, the beetles were frozen, dissected, and lyophilized. CTD was extracted using ethyl acetate and analyzed via GC-MS. The results were quantified using peak integration.","In order to assess if T. transversalis can sequester CTD from L. trimaculatus, specimens collected on 23rd June 2021 were stored in fauna boxes (39 × 28 × 28 cm) for 24 h, divided into two groups (i.e., treated group and untreated or control group), both comprising 25 individuals (N = 16 males; N = 9 females). In the treated group, T. transversalis individuals were stored together with 32 individuals of L. trimaculatus, while, in the control group, individuals of T. transversalis were isolated from any source of CTD. Fauna boxes were lined internally with paper sheets and set up with crumpled papers to increase the three-dimensionality of the arena and provide a suitable substrate for insect locomotion. A 10% sucrose solution was provided to both groups in a tube capped with cotton wool and leaned on a Petri dish inside the fauna boxes. After 24 h, treated and control individuals of T. transversalis were frozen at −80°C. Because of the tricky sex determination, individuals were sorted by sex only after the freezing phase to avoid overstressing the specimens. To explore possible differences in CTD storage throughout the body, specimens were dissected, isolating head and prothorax (HP) from the rest of the body (BR), then lyophilized for 48 h using Telstar LyoQuest −55/230 V 50 Hz. To allow a better quantification of CTD content, we pooled the specimens in a total of eight samples: TM-HP (treated males—head and prothorax; N = 16), CM-HP (control males—head and prothorax; N = 16), TM-BR (treated males—rest of the body; N = 16), CM-BR (control males—rest of the body; N = 16), TF-HP (treated females—head and prothorax; N = 9), CF-HP (control females—head and prothorax; N = 9), TF-BR (treated females—rest of the body; N = 9), CF-BR (control females—rest of the body; N = 9). Extraction and detection of CTD were performed following the protocol described in. Each sample was ground using a pestle and mixed with 50 ml of ethyl acetate (AcOEt, 99.8%; Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) in a round-bottom flasks at reflux temperature (80°C) for 48 h and subsequently filtered, after cooling down, with polytetrafluoroethylene filters (13 mm × 0.2 μm Acrodisc MS Syringe Filter; Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY) to separate the organic solution from the insoluble remains (e.g., small cuticular fragments). The solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure (BUCHI Rotavapor R II, Flawil, Switzerland, or Edwards RV3, Burgess Hill, United Kingdom) to obtain a yellowish sticky oil covering the bottom of flasks. After the extraction, the samples were injected in a gas chromatography system equipped with capillary column SLB-5 ms (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS; QP2010S, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) carrying out five replicates for each sample. The analysis program follows a temperature ramp from 50 to 260°C with a 10°C/min rate. The quantification was performed by mathematical integration of the area underneath the target peak provided by GC-MS Solution software (version 2.7; Shimadzu). Since samples were unitary, results for each sample represent the mean concentration of CTD of several individuals, but we have no data about the variability within samples, and thus our chemical results are only qualitative. Box plots were drawn on R Statistical Software (v4.1.2) using five instrumental replicates of each sample."
TA043295_R_0001,"The study documents the first observation of canthariphilous behavior in the checkered beetle Tilloidea transversalis, which was seen biting the blister beetle Lydus trimaculatus in the field. Laboratory experiments confirmed this behavior and showed that T. transversalis targets CTD-producing species, sequestering cantharidin (CTD) from their hemolymph. Chemical analyses confirmed the presence of CTD in T. transversalis, with higher concentrations in treated groups.","During a sample survey aimed at collecting canthariphilous species through CTD-baited traps, two individuals of the phytophagous species T. transversalis (; personal observation) were observed being stuck with their mandibles on the abdominal tergites of one individual of L. trimaculatus feeding on a sweet scabious [Sixalix atropurpurea (L.) Greuter and Burdet, 1985] (3 July 2020; Italy, Lazio, Roma, Tolfa, Rio Fiume, 42.058720N, 11.941320E, 44 m a.s.l.) (Fig. 1; Supp. Video 1 [online only]). Both species are common in the area but localized on their host plants, locally mainly represented by both sweet scabious and cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) for L. trimaculatus and T. transversalis, respectively. The two individuals of T. transversalis remained several minutes on L. trimaculatus, which, in the meantime, kept feeding on its host plant inflorescence. Afterwards, the two checkered beetles flew away independently.In laboratory experiments, attacks of T. transversalis were recorded only against L. trimaculatus (in six out of seven replicates) and O. flavipes (in three out of seven replicates) (the presence of CTD has previously been documented in both species:) (Table 1). Although the rate of attack is not significantly dissimilar (Chi-square statistic = 2.8; df = 1; P = 0.09), we observed a different behavior of T. transversalis on the two species. When interacting with L. trimaculatus, T. transversalis showed a peculiar behavior: it firmly attached itself to the body of the host (legs, abdomen, or elytra) through its mandibles, folded legs, and antennae under its own body and rhythmically moved the maxillae to ingest the hemolymph bleeding from the prey (Fig. 2; Supp. Video 2 [online only]). This behavior could last up to 48 min (27.81 ± 13.11 min [mean ± SD]; N = 7). At the end of the bite, the beetles left the host which, apparently, continued its activities undamaged. In three additional laboratory experiments, T. transversalis displayed this same behavior toward Mylabris variabilis (Pallas, 1781) (Coleoptera: Meloidae). Contrastingly, when T. transversalis attacked O. flavipes in captivity, the behavior mentioned above changed rapidly to ordinary predation, in which the prey was dismembered and, at least partially, ingested. Both males and females of T. transversalis exhibited predatory behaviors on O. flavipes (N = 2 males; N = 1 female) and L. trimaculatus (N = 7 males; N = 6 females).Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses showed the presence of CTD in the body of T. transversalis. Results are summarized in Fig. 3. Concentrations were qualitatively higher in all treated groups than in control groups and the highest concentrations were observed in the rest of the body of treated females (Fig. 3)."
TA043295_D_0001,"The study documents the first observed canthariphilous interaction between the checkered beetle Tilloidea transversalis and the blister beetle Lydus trimaculatus, a known cantharidin (CTD) producer. Field and laboratory experiments confirmed that T. transversalis selectively attacks CTD-producing species, sequestering CTD from L. trimaculatus. However, unlike other canthariphilous species, T. transversalis does not show strong attraction to pure synthetic CTD, suggesting other signals may be involved in triggering this behavior.","Our field observation showed a peculiar feeding behavior of the phytophagous species T. transversalis on the blister beetle L. trimaculatus (Fig. 1; Supp. Video 1 [online only]). Our laboratory experiments, performed on a representative subset of the beetle community co-occurring in the area, clearly showed that this behavior occurs only on CTD-producing species (Table 1). Moreover, chemical analyses confirmed that males and females of T. transversalis can sequester CTD from L. trimaculatus (Fig. 3). This evidence demonstrates that T. transversalis likely represents a newly ascertained canthariphilous species, revealing for the first time canthariphilous interactions between checkered beetles and CTD-producing species. Although not statistically significant in terms of occurrence, a higher number of attacks of T. transversalis was observed on L. trimaculatus than on O. flavipes, and, surprisingly, this behavior led to different outcomes depending on the attacked species. Notably, although starting similarly (i.e., the checkered beetle tried to extract hemolymph from the host), when attacking O. flavipes, the behavior of T. transversalis changed into destructive predation involving the ingestion of other tissues and leading to the death of the prey. Further investigations are needed to clarify whether T. transversalis commonly attacks species of Oedemeridae in the wild or if captivity conditions bias our observations. On the contrary, the highly specialized behavior of ingesting the hemolymph of L. trimaculatus (Fig. 2; Supp. Video 2 [online only]), together with our field observation (Fig. 1; Supp. Video 1 [online only]), demonstrated that T. transversalis actively extracts hemolymph from this species of blister beetle. Those results, together with our additional observation on M. variabilis, and a photographic record of T. transversalis biting Zonitis immaculata (Olivier, 1789) (Coleoptera: Meloidae) on their shared host plant C. cardunculus, suggest that this checkered beetle commonly attacks blister beetles in the wild. According to this evidence, and because of the absence of attacks of this phytophagous species on non-CTD-producing species, it could be inferred that T. transversalis evolved a detection mechanism allowing to locate CTD-producing species from which (at least in L. trimaculatus) sequestering CTD."
TA043295_D_0002,"The study explores the evolutionary implications of canthariphily, suggesting it may have evolved independently in Cleridae. Unlike other canthariphilous species, T. transversalis does not appear strongly attracted to pure CTD, hinting at alternative signals. Chemical analyses revealed CTD sequestration in T. transversalis, with potential roles in courtship and offspring defense, though further research is needed to confirm these hypotheses.","Our findings contribute to knowledge on the complex and still deeply undisclosed phenomenon of canthariphily, the evolution of which remains a puzzling question for evolutionary biologists. proposed the hypothesis that the presence of canthariphilous species within phylogenetically related taxa to CTD-producing species could indicate a plesiomorphic condition of CTD production, retained in CTD-producing species (Meloidae and Oedemeridae) and lost secondarily in canthariphilous species (Anthicidae and Pyrochroidae). However, this hypothesis does not justify the presence of canthariphily in other phylogenetically distant taxa such as Cleridae. Moreover, the presence of canthariphilous species in other orders and classes of Arthropoda suggests that canthariphily evolved independently several times. Previous studies suggest that some phytophagous species, frequently trapped in CTD-baited traps, may have evolved a canthariphilous behavior due to the similarity of CTD to other plants and fungal chemicals used by species in food search. It is noteworthy that our field observation occurred in the frame of a longitudinal sampling of canthariphilous species by CTD-baited traps and, surprisingly, despite the high occurrence of T. transversalis in the area, this species seems not to be attracted to traps since only one individual was collected during all the sampling season. Thus, in this species, canthariphilous behavior and attraction to CTD-producing species may have evolved differently from other canthariphilous phytophagous species. Although further investigations are needed to ascertain the lack of attraction to pure CTD in T. transversalis, our observation seems to corroborate the hypothesis proposed in that other unknown signals, alone or in combination with CTD, are involved in the identification of CTD-producing species by some canthariphilous species. Comparing our results with those of previous studies suggests that canthariphily (and CTD tolerance) could have also evolved independently within the Cleridae family. In fact, T. transversalis is neither clearly attracted to pure CTD, as in the case of P. rufimembris, nor it is a generalist omnivore species feeding on CTD-producing species, as in the case of T. apiarius. The results of chemical analyses showed the presence of CTD in T. transversalis. The presence of CTD even in the control groups probably indicates that some of the individuals within the samples had already sequestered CTD in the wild before being collected. Although preliminary, results of the treated groups seem to suggest that CTD is stored more in some BR than HP tissues (Fig. 3). Several mating events have been observed during the experiments and the higher concentration of CTD in the females BR (both in control and treated groups), together with its low concentration in CM-BR (which have no access to CTD), could indicate that males passed BR-stored CTD to females during the copula (Fig. 3). If confirmed, this scenario would be congruent with what has already been observed in other canthariphilous and CTD-producing species, eventually suggesting a role of CTD in courtship behavior and offspring defense in T. transversalis. However, our protocol does not allow us to discern from alternative hypotheses; therefore, further chemical and behavioral investigations are needed to deeply investigate the role of CTD in the courtship behavior and offspring defense of T. transversalis. The present manuscript provides selective interspecific interaction of a phytophagous species toward CTD-producing species, proving for the first time ever the evolution of canthariphily in Cleridae through behavioral experiments in a species not strongly attracted to CTD-baited traps."
TA041124_I_0001,"Specialized metabolites, particularly monoterpene indole alkaloids, play crucial roles in plant defense and exhibit diverse pharmacological properties, with their biosynthesis pathways being studied in various plants.","Specialized metabolites have evolved in plants to cope with environmental pressure and the myriad of biotic and abiotic stresses imposed by their sessile status. Within this broad group of metabolites, alkaloids are compounds with diverse physiological roles and often described as highly poisonous molecules that protect plants against pests and herbivores. The monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are one of the most structurally diverse families of alkaloids, with more than 2500 distinct molecules identified so far. MIAs are widespread within the Gentianales order including Apocynaceae, Gelsemiaceae, Loganiaceae, and Rubiaceae, and are also biosynthesized in Nyssaceae (Cornales order) and in Icacinaceae. Almost all MIAs derive from a common precursor, strictosidine, which undergoes a series of complex rearrangements leading to the formation of distinct main MIA classes, based on the skeleton configuration. These include the sarpagan, yohimbane and heteroyohimbane, aspidosperma, iboga or quinoline MIA types that are heterogeneously distributed among the MIA producing plants. While the ecological functions of most MIAs remain cryptic, recent work suggests that these compounds protect the producing plants against certain herbivores. Numerous MIAs also exhibit astonishing pharmaceutical properties encompassing the anticancer vinblastine and vincristine, the antimalarial quinine, the antihypertensive ajmalicine or the antiarrhythmic ajmaline that explain the ever-growing interest of the scientific community for the study of their biosynthesis. In addition, many MIAs also display undervalued or underexploited biological activities due to their low bioavailability in planta while other MIAs have recreational uses such as the yohimbane MIA yohimbine described as a stimulant."
TA041124_I_0002,"The biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids involves multiple enzymes and pathways, with recent genome sequencing providing insights into their complex mechanisms, particularly in Rauvolfia tetraphylla.","Over years, characterization of the MIA biosynthesis has been mainly performed through the combination of metabolomic, biochemical and transcriptomic approaches performed using the iconic MIA producing plant Catharanthus roseus and to a lesser extent in Rauvolfia sp.. Recently, the sequencing of many MIA producing plant genomes have provided complementary unprecedented insights into the understanding of their metabolism. These genomes include Rhazya stricta, Gelsemium sempervirens, Camptotheca accuminata, Ophiorrhiza pumila, Mitragyna speciosa, Neolamarckia cadamba, Vinca minor, Voacanga thouarsii and C. roseus. To date, all MIA biosynthetic steps up to the strictosidine biosynthetic intermediate have been discovered. This includes the upstream enzymes responsible for the transformation of geranyl diphosphate into secologanin, the ultimate terpenoid precursor of MIAs, but also the tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) catalyzing the decarboxylation of tryptophan into tryptamine, the indole MIA precursor. Secologanin and tryptamine are condensed by strictosidine synthase (STR) to from strictosidine, which is then deglucosylated by strictosidine β-D-glucosidase (SGD) that has been cloned in both C. roseus and R. serpentina. The deglucosylation of strictosidine leads to the formation of a highly reactive aglycone that causes protein reticulation as a part of a defense response. Notably, strictosidine aglycone also undergoes spontaneous rearrangements to form 4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine, which is then reduced by dedicated alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). These reduced products are then shuttled into various pathway branches that eventually generate the plethora of downstream MIAs, confirming the major contribution of ADHs to MIA structural diversity."
TA041124_I_0003,"Various enzymes, including medium chain dehydrogenase/reductases and short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases, are involved in the biosynthesis of different monoterpene indole alkaloids, with yohimbanes remaining uncharacterized until this study.","Indeed, the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) geissoschizine synthase (GS) reduces 4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine into geissoschizine, which enters the biosynthetic pathway of sarpagan, aspidosperma and iboga MIAs including among others tabersonine/catharanthine in C. roseus, ajmaline in Rauvolfia sp., ibogaine in Tabernanthe iboga or strychnine in Strychnos nux vomica. The 4,21-dehydrogeissoschizine can also undergo spontaneous rearrangements to form cathenamine and 19-epi-cathenamine whose reduction through chemical treatments or co-incubation with C. roseus crude protein extracts with NAPDH yields the formation of heteroyohimbane MIAs such as ajmalicine or tetrahydroalstonine. Five MDRs that reduce cathenamine/epi-cathenamine have been then characterized in C. roseus including four tetrahydroalstonine synthases (THAS1-THAS4) and heteroyohimbine synthase (HYS), which synthesizes a mixture of ajmalicine, tetrahydroalstonine and 19-epi-ajmalicine. Interestingly, THAS1 and THAS2 also reduce the iminium precursor of vinblastine/vincristine. A short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (SDR), namely vitrosamine synthase (VAS) has also been described to reduce the strictosidine aglycone into the cryptic MIA vitrosamine (VAS). In addition, members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family have been recruited for MIA biosynthesis, including redox2 that reduces akuammicine derivatives in C. roseus and can work in combination with GS to produce isositsirikine. This also includes the perakine reductase (PR) that ensures the reduction of the sarpagan MIA perakine into raucaffrinolide in R. serpentina. However, no enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of yohimbanes including the four isomers yohimbine, rauwolscine, corynanthine, and allo-yohimbine has been identified to date (Fig. 1). Interestingly, rauwolscine, also known as α-yohimbine, and yohimbine are described as specific antagonists of brain α2-adrenergic receptors that can be used, respectively, to treat levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease and as a tool to study alcohol use disorder. Allo-yohimbine displays similar pharmacological properties but corynanthine is known to be a selective α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist reducing intraocular pressure for instance. While these MIAs are synthesized in many plants, rauwolscine and yohimbine are highly accumulated in Rauvolfia sp. and notably in R. tetraphylla (“be still tree” or “devil-pepper”) making of this plant a powerful model system for the elucidation of yohimbane biosynthesis (Fig. 2a)."
TA041124_I_0004,"The study combines transcriptomics, genome sequencing, and machine learning to identify and characterize enzymes involved in yohimbane biosynthesis in Rauvolfia tetraphylla, revealing multiple biosynthetic routes.","Here, we combine transcriptomics, genome sequencing in R. tetraphylla to identify biosynthetic genes for yohimbanes using a machine learning (ML) approach. We established that many of the ADH encoding genes were clustered in the genome and displayed expression patterns similar to other previously characterized MIA biosynthetic genes. Secondly, by testing enzyme activity of the identified genes in yeast and using recombinant proteins, we identified three enzymes that produce yohimbanes both in vitro and in vivo, when assayed with SGD and strictosidine, including a highly efficient enzyme producing several yohimbane isomers. Finally, we also demonstrated that these MIAs can be also produced through a double-enzyme mechanism including a GS ortholog thus highlighting the diversity of yohimbane biosynthetic routes evolved by R. tetraphylla."
TA041124_M_0001,"The study employed a multi-omics approach to investigate the biosynthesis of yohimbane monoterpene indole alkaloids in Rauvolfia tetraphylla. DNA was extracted from young leaves, and libraries were prepared for both Illumina and Nanopore sequencing. The genome was assembled using Flye and polished with Illumina reads. RNA was extracted from various tissues and conditions, sequenced, and aligned to the genome. Protein extraction and mass spectrometry were performed for proteomics, while metabolite profiling was conducted using UPLC-MS.","Rauvolfia tetraphylla seeds (Konstanz botanical garden, Germany) were germinated and planted in individual pots. Seedlings were allowed to grow at 28°C under a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. DNA was extracted from young leaves of two-month-old plants using Qiagen Plant DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNAseq library was performed by Future Genomics Technologies (Leiden, The Netherlands) using Nextera Flex kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) for Illumina sequencing and ONT 1D ligation sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd, Oxford, United-Kingdom) for Nanopore sequencing. Illumina libraries were sequenced in paired-end mode (2 × 150 bp) using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 technology. ONT libraries were sequenced on Nanopore PromethION flowcell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd, Oxford, United-Kingdom) with the guppy version 3.0.3 high-accuracy basecaller. The R. tetraphylla genome assembly was performed by Future Genomics Technologies (Leiden, The Netherlands). ONT reads were first assembled using Flye assembler (v.2.5). Contig were twice corrected with ONT reads using Flye (v.2.5) and subsequently polished twice with Illumina reads using pilon (v.1.23). Redundant contigs were removed using purge_haplotigs (v.1.1.0) followed by a last round of polishing with Illumina reads using pilon. RNA was extracted from 94 different R. tetraphylla samples, obtained from 94 different tissue types and experimental conditions including: small tetrad leaves, big tetrad leaves, stems, flowers, berries, young leaves, roots, first leaf pairs, leaves and roots grown under high and low light conditions and leaves fed on by M. sexta. Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA was extracted using the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpinⓇ RNA plant and fungi kit (Düren, Germany) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA library construction and sequencing were performed at FGTech using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 technology. Sequencing data has been deposited under the Bioproject accession number: PRJNA771251. RNA-seq reads were processed using FastP (v0.20) with default settings. The resulting reads were then aligned to the R. tetraphylla reference genome using HiSAT2 (2.2.1) for each of the 94 individual samples. Each individual alignment was then assembled into individual transcriptomes using StringTie (v2.1.7). The resulting 94 individual transcriptomes were then merged into a non-redundant set of 56,389 representative transcripts using stringtie --merge. Functional annotation of the consensus transcriptome was achieved with the Trinotate pipeline (v3.0.1), which integrates results from blastp and blastx searches of TransDecoder (v5.5.0) predicted ORFs against the Uniprot database, and hmmscan (v3.1b2) against the PFAM database. Leaves from three-months-old plants were manually cut to allow the latex to pour out. The latex was collected with a pipette tip and immediately dissolved in the protein precipitation buffer. Proteins from the corresponding leaves were also extracted after leaf grinding in the described extraction buffer. Proteins were separated on the denaturing 10% acrylamide gel and analyzed with Colloidal Comassie Blue (CCB) under sterile conditions. 1-cm large strips were cut off the gel and sent to the PAPPSO Platform (INRAE Moulon) for in gel digestion, LC MS/MS analysis and peptide identifications. Metabolites were extracted from 94 different R. tetraphylla samples, obtained from 94 different tissue types and experimental conditions. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, then freeze-dried, ground into powder, and sonicated with methanol 0.1% of formic acid to extract metabolites. For R. tetraphylla latex, around 200 µL of latex from freshly cut leaves were diluted in 200 µL of PBS buffer and the alkaloids were extracted by adding one volume of methanol 0.1% of formic acid. After centrifugations, extracts were diluted in water Milli-Q 0.1% of formic acid and injected on a UPLC system (Acquity, Waters) coupled to a single quadrupole mass spectrometer with an 18-min linear gradient from 10 to 40% acetonitrile (containing 0.1% formic acid)."
TA041124_M_0002,"The study utilized machine learning to predict MIA-related genes and constructed co-expression networks to identify biosynthetic gene clusters. Gene families were analyzed using OrthoFinder, and phylogenetic trees were built to infer evolutionary relationships. Enzyme assays were performed to validate the activity of candidate genes, and heterologous expression in yeast and E. coli was used to confirm their roles in yohimbane biosynthesis.","To predict the MIA-related genes from our gene expression atlas with ANN, we referred to our recently described protocol. The input dataset was the same than the one used to construct co-expression network. The H2O library (v3.36) in R (v4.2) was used to train a feedforward neural network with backpropagation. To define the true positive events, a number of genes were labeled as MIA as described above. For the true negative events (non-MIA related genes), we used genes predicted as conserved orthologs from the BUSCO evaluation made to assess assembly completeness. Because these genes are strongly conserved across very diverse plant families, they are not expected to belong to the MIA pathway. We finally labeled 75 genes as MIA-related and 1908 as non-MIA related. This set was split into a training and a validation dataset following a 70/30 partition with seed 666. Once a network (seed 666) was trained, we looked at the number of MIA predicted genes using the full dataset (with data unseen by the network). The logloss was used as a stopping metric. A hyperparameter search revealed that a simple architecture containing 1 input layer (57 samples), 2 hidden layers (with 40 and 20 neurons, respectively) and an output layer containing 2 values (MIA vs non-MIA) provided the most relevant predictions. We added dropout ratios (0.1 in the input and 0.5 in each hidden) to improve the model generalization. The number of epochs was selected by visually inspecting the logloss progression during iterations. A value of 1500 was found to be the most appropriate to avoid overfitting. Calculations were done on a classical computer device (8 CPU, RAM 16 Gb). A personal script was used to identify regions of physically co-localized biosynthetic genes associated with MIA-annotated genes. As input the script depends on (i) a list of blast hits vs known MIA genes, the (ii) resulting genome gtf file from stringtie --merge containing the structural definition of transcripts assembled from read alignments against the genome, and (iii) uniprot search results. In brief, the script first anchors the putative MIA orthologs blastn result and the pfam annotations onto the R. tetraphylla genomes gtf file. Next, 100,000 bp regions are scanned on either sides of the MIA annotation to search for any genes with the following pfam accessions annotated: PF03171 (2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase superfamily), PF14226 (non-haem dioxygenase in morphine synthesis N-terminal), PF00891 (O-methyltransferase domain), PF08240 (Alcohol dehydrogenase GroES-like domain), PF00067 (Cytochrome P450), PF08031 (Berberine and berberine-like), and PF00201 (UDP-glucosyl transferase). Regions with more than one gene of interest (MIA + pfam accession of interest) were recorded as a cluster of interest. To build gene families, protein sequences of at least 30 amino acids from R. tetraphylla were compared with eleven other species including V. thouarsii, V. minor, C. roseus, A. thaliana, M. speciosa, S. lycopersicum, C. acuminata, C. gigantea, G. sempervirens, and O. pumila. For each species, the longest representative protein was selected in each CD-HIT (v.4.7) cluster. The resulting sequences were used as input for OrthoFinder (v.2.5.4) using the following parameters: -S diamond -M msa -A muscle -T raxml-ng. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was built from 645 single-copy orthogroups. Cafe5 (v.4.2.1) was used to determine orthogroup loss and expansion across the phylogenetic tree. The ADH candidates were ordered from Integrated DNA technologies with a set of universal overhangs at both the 3’ and 5’ end to facilitate easy amplification with a single set of universal primers. Each sequence was cloned into a 2 µ plasmid backbone by use of USER-cloning, with a TRP5 selection marker, and a bi-directional promoter system allowing multicopy co-expression of RseSGD and the ADH’s of interest. The resulting plasmids were propagated in DH5a competent cells and all plasmids were verified by sanger sequencing prior to transformation. Each plasmid was transformed into MIA-CH-A2 using standard LiAc/Heatshock methods according to Gietz and Schiestl. To test the yeast strains expressing ADH candidates for production, six colonies of each strain were inoculated in 150 µL synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan (SC-Trp) and incubated overnight at 30°C and 300 rpm in 96-well microtiter plates. After 16 h, 5 µL of each culture was transferred into 0.295 mL of SC-Trp supplemented with 0.25 mM secologanin and 1 mM tryptamine in deep well plates. The plates were then incubated for 96 h at 30°C and 300 rpm. At the end of the culture, yeast were removed from the medium by ultrafiltration through an acroprep filter plate at 5000 g for 5 min. Supernatant was mixed with 9 volumes of methanol and 5 µl was analyzed on UPLC-MS as described above in Metabolite profiling of R. tetraphylla. Coding sequences of candidates ADH were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using their respective primers and were subsequently cloned in the pRSET-A (Invitrogen) plasmid. E. coli BL21 (DE3) were then transformed using the recombinant plasmid. Transformed bacterial strains were cultivated until exponential growth (Abs=0.6) and protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG for 3 h at 30°C. E. coli were subsequently lysed using a 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 in presence of 300 mM NaCl, 10 mg/mL lysozyme and Sigma EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, 20 u of DNaseI (Invitrogen) were added and lysate was incubated further for 10 min at room temperature. Sonication of the samples was then done on ice, with an amplitude of 40% and duty cycle of 20 s/40 s using a SONOPULS UW100 (Bandelin) for 3 min. Sonication was repeated twice. Bacterial lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g, 4°C for 20 min and recombinant proteins were purified on Co2+ matrix following the manufacturer’s protocol (TALON metal affinity resin, TaKaRa). Eluate was desalted using PD10 columns (GE Healthcare) in a 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.5 buffer with 100 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol. They were subsequently concentrated when necessary using centricon (30 kDA cut-off, Merck Millipore). Protein concentration was measured according to. Purity of the protein was confirmed on a denaturing 10% acrylamide gel and analyzed with CCB. For in vitro assays, strictosidine aglycones used as ADH substrates were obtained by incubating 50 µM of strictosidine and 0,5 µg of recombinant SGD in 10 µL of a 80 mM citrate buffer pH 6 for 20 min at 30°C. Afterward, 1 mM NADH, 50 mM potassium-phosphate pH 7,5 buffer and 1–3 µg of purified ADH were added in a final volume of 100 µL. Reaction was stopped with one volume of methanol after 0 or 1 h of incubation at 32°C. To remove the proteins, samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm. The supernantent recovered and 5 µL were used for UPLC-MS analysis as described above in Metabolite profiling of R. tetraphylla. SGD control was performed by adding 20 µL of HCl 1 M prior to the first incubation."
TA041124_D_0001,"The study focuses on the biosynthesis of yohimbane monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) in Rauvolfia tetraphylla, a species known for producing pharmacologically active compounds. The research combines metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and genome sequencing to identify key enzymes involved in yohimbane synthesis. The genome of R. tetraphylla is highly contiguous and complete, with gene family analysis revealing an enrichment in genes associated with specialized metabolism, particularly indole metabolism. The study identifies a multifunctional yohimbane synthase (YOS) and other enzymes with yohimbane synthase activity, suggesting multiple biosynthetic routes for these compounds.","Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are a structurally diverse family of specialized metabolites mainly produced in Gentianales to cope with environmental challenges. Due to their pharmacological properties, the biosynthetic modalities of several MIA types have been elucidated but not that of the yohimbanes. Here, we combine metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and genome sequencing of Rauvolfia tetraphylla with machine learning to discover the unexpected multiple actors of this natural product synthesis. We identify a medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) that produces a mixture of four diastereomers of yohimbanes including the well-known yohimbine and rauwolscine. In addition to this multifunctional yohimbane synthase (YOS), an MDR synthesizing mainly heteroyohimbanes and the short chain dehydrogenase vitrosamine synthase also display a yohimbane synthase side activity. Lastly, we establish that the combination of geissoschizine synthase with at least three other MDRs also produces a yohimbane mixture thus shedding light on the complex mechanisms evolved for the synthesis of these plant bioactives."
TA041124_D_0002,"The discussion highlights the genomic and evolutionary context of MIA biosynthesis in R. tetraphylla, comparing it to other well-studied species like Catharanthus roseus. The study notes the presence of MIA gene clusters and local gene duplications, which may explain the diversity of MIA biosynthesis. The identification of YOS and other enzymes with yohimbane synthase activity suggests multiple evolutionary pathways for yohimbane synthesis. The study also explores the subcellular localization of enzymes and their expression patterns, which influence the production of different MIAs in various plant tissues. The findings suggest that yohimbane synthesis may involve both single-enzyme and multi-enzyme mechanisms, reflecting the evolutionary diversification of biosynthetic pathways.","To date, the study of MIA biosynthesis has been mainly conducted in a few but well-known species including C. roseus for vindoline and catharanthine, V. minor for vincamine, C. acuminata for camptothecin or R. serpentina for ajmaline. For the first three species, high quality genomes have been published and have guided the elucidation of specific steps MIA biosynthesis as elegantly conducted in C. roseus. In the present study, we have first described the sequencing of R. tetraphylla, a related R. serpentina species, well known for MIA synthesis. This genome is characterized by a very high contiguity and completeness. We annotated a total of 23,228 genes which is comparable to other published Apocynaceae genomes. Gene family identification, phylogenetic relationships and gene family contraction and expansion analysis showed an enrichment in genes associated with specialized metabolism, notably indole metabolism in R. tetraphylla. Regarding MIA synthesis, we also noted the presence of several potential MIA clusters somehow similar to what has been observed in C. roseus thus arguing for a conservation of the genomic organization of MIA biosynthetic genes. Interestingly, and similarly to previous observations in C. roseus, we noted a putative local duplication of an ADH rich cluster in R. tetraphylla (Supplementary Fig. S3). Such duplication could explain the enrichment in genes associated with indole metabolism in R. tetraphylla. These duplications could also be the source of enzyme subfunctionalization leading to the diversity and molecular variability found in closely related AIM-producing species."
TA041124_D_0003,"The study delves into the biochemical and mechanistic aspects of yohimbane synthesis, identifying key enzymes like YOS, RtTHAS3, and RtVAS. These enzymes exhibit varying levels of yohimbane synthase activity, with YOS being the most efficient. The research also explores the potential for multi-enzyme systems in yohimbane biosynthesis, involving geissoschizine synthase and other MDRs. The findings suggest that yohimbane synthesis may involve competition for substrates like 4,21 dehydrogeissoschizine, with enzyme localization and expression levels playing critical roles in determining the final MIA products. The study concludes by highlighting the evolutionary implications of these findings and the potential for engineering yohimbane production in yeast.","Given the high abundance of rauwolscine in R. tetraphylla, we engaged in the identification of the genes/enzymes involved in the synthesis of yohimbanes since this MIA type has not been documented at the biosynthetic level to date. Using this new genomic resource, the associated transcriptomic analyses and a targeted proteomic studies, we combined the study of the gene expression correlation to the prediction MIA biosynthetic genes guided by machine learning or based on their genomic localization to unravel the actor of yohimbane synthesis. Based on the mechanism of heteroyohimbane and strychnos formation, we focused on proteins from different ADH families, notably MDR and SDR that have already been associated to MIA synthesis. By combining activity testing in yeast to biochemical assays using recombinant enzymes, we first identified four enzymes displaying a high tetrahydroalstonine synthase activity (RtTHAS3, RtTHAS4A, RtTHAS4B, THAS5) and noticed that these proteins also synthesize at lower amounts mayumbine and another unknown MIA (RT 12.3) (Figs. 9, 10). Interestingly, in our experimental conditions, AMS produces a racemic mixture of ajmalicine and mayumbine in agreement with its high identity with HYS from C. roseus and the presence of these MIA in planta (Figs. 5b, 9). However, no production of tetrahydroalstonine was monitored suggesting a slightly different catalytic mechanism compared to HYS. Overall, the efficient biosynthetic activity of AMS combined to its very high expression level in leaf argue for a main role of AMS in the synthesis of ajmalicine and mayumbine in the aerial parts of the plant. By contrast, RtTHAS3, RtTHAS4A and RtTHAS4B are probably the main contributors to the synthesis of tetrahydroalstonine and its abundant derivatives including reserpilline and isoreserpilline in plant leaves, based on their expression profiles (Supplementary Fig. S9). This finding thus reinforces the role of MDR and especially CAD-like in MIA biosynthesis. However, we also showed that a non-CAD MDR (THAS5) can synthesize heteroyohimbanes suggesting that distinct evolutionary processes led to the formation of this biosynthetic activity."
TA041124_D_0004,"The study concludes by emphasizing the complexity and diversity of yohimbane biosynthesis in R. tetraphylla, highlighting the role of YOS and other enzymes in this process. The findings suggest that yohimbane synthesis may involve both single-enzyme and multi-enzyme systems, with evolutionary implications for the diversification of MIA biosynthesis. The study also discusses the potential for engineering yohimbane production in yeast, which could have significant pharmacological applications. The integration of multiple omics approaches and machine learning was critical in uncovering these biosynthetic pathways, providing a model for future studies on specialized metabolism in plants.","In conclusion, by sequencing the genome of R. tetraphylla and combining distinct MIA candidate gene prediction approaches, we identified several enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of yohimbanes. While the use of a single prediction approach may result in the identification of interesting candidates such as YOS in the latex proteome, integration of several strategies including ML based approach, co-expression analysis and gene cluster screening first reinforced the aforementioned enzyme identification but also widened discovery to unexpected biosynthetic mechanism such as yohimbane synthesis through a double enzyme process. Such a result thus adds another level of understanding to the MIA synthesis resulting from strictosidine aglycone reductions, besides the already described strychnos and heteroyohimbane MIAs. While several mechanisms of yohimbane synthesis may co-occur in planta, the high activity of YOS in yeast potentially paves the way for the synthesis of rauwolscine and other yohimbane in yeast as already described for other highly valuable MIAs and their halogenated derivatives. This is especially required to exploit the selective affinity of rauwolscine and corynanthine for α2-adrenergic and α1-adrenergic receptors, respectively."
TA045385_I_0001,"The study evaluates the cytotoxic potential of semi-synthetic triterpenoids with A-azepano- or 3-amino-3,4-seco-modified rings, derived from betulin, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, and glycyrrhetinic acid, against various cancer cell lines, highlighting their apoptosis-inducing mechanisms and selectivity profiles.","Semi-synthetic triterpenoids, holding an amino substituted seven-membered A-ring(azepano-ring), which could be synthesized from triterpenic oximes through aBeckmann type rearrangement followed by a reduction of lactame fragment, areconsidered to be novel promising agents exhibiting anti-microbial,alpha-glucosidase, and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. In thisstudy, in an attempt to develop new antitumor candidates, a series of A-ringazepano- and 3-amino-3,4-seco-derivatives of betulin, oleanolic, ursolic, andglycyrrhetinic acids were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against fivehuman cancer cell lines and non-malignant mouse fibroblasts by means of acolorimetric sulforhodamine assay. Azepanoallobetulinic acid amide derivative 11was the most cytotoxic compound of this series but showed little selectivitybetween the different human tumor cell lines. Flow cytometry experiments showedcompound 11 to act mainly by apoptosis (44.3%) and late apoptosis (21.4%). Thecompounds were further screened at the National Cancer Institute towards a panelof 60 cancer cell lines. It was found that compounds 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16,19, and 20 showed growth inhibitory (GI(50)) against the most sensitive celllines at submicromolar concentrations (0.20-0.94 μM), and their cytotoxicactivity (LC(50)) was also high (1-6 μM). Derivatives 3, 8, 11, 15, and 16demonstrated a certain selectivity profile at GI(50) level from 5.16 to 9.56towards K-562, CCRF-CEM, HL-60(TB), and RPMI-8226 (Leukemia), HT29 (Coloncancer), and OVCAR-4 (Ovarian cancer) cell lines. Selectivity indexes ofazepanoerythrodiol 3 at TGI level ranged from 5.93 (CNS cancer cell lines SF-539,SNB-19 and SNB-75) to 14.89 for HCT-116 (colon cancer) with SI 9.56 at GI(50)level for the leukemia cell line K-562. The present study highlighted theimportance of A-azepano-ring in the triterpenic core for the development of novelantitumor agents, and a future aim to increase the selectivity profile will thuslie in the area of modifications of azepano-triterpenic acids at their carboxylgroup."
TA045385_I_0002,"The introduction discusses the increasing global burden of cancer, emphasizing the need for novel antitumor agents derived from natural products, particularly pentacyclic triterpenoids, due to their multi-target therapeutic potential and sustainable synthesis, while highlighting the importance of functional modifications for enhancing cytotoxicity and selectivity.","Demographic changes such as the growth of the world population combined with an increase in life expectancy led to an increasing number of patients suffering from oncological diseases. Thus, cancer is a one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and the number of new cases of diseases caused by cancer is expected to rise by about 70% over the next two decades. Therefore, there is an urgent need of novel antitumor agents acting by novel modes of action. A promising strategy is to generate new antitumor agents from natural products. This seems particularly interesting for two reasons: On the one hand, pharmaceuticals derived from natural substances have already proven to be very effective in many cases, and on the other hand, this strategy results in sustainability in the sense of a green, ecologically oriented chemistry. Natural products remain an excellent source of drugs; for example, from 1980s to date, nearly 50% of all drugs are of natural product origin. Pentacyclic triterpenoids, which are naturally occurring secondary metabolites widespread in plants, marine invertebrates, and fungi, were recently reconsidered as model compounds for the development of innovative anticancer agents. Their activity against proteins involved in tumor development enhances the opportunity to exploit these compounds as new multi-target therapeutic agents.Over the past years, a large number of triterpenoids have been chemically modified in order to improve their bioactivity and bioavailability and to enhance their protective and/or therapeutic effects. Many studies reported triterpenoids including betulin and betulinic acid, oleanolic, ursolic, boswellic, maslinic, and glycyrrhetinic acids to exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, or antidiabetic.As far as cytotoxic properties are concerned, the presence of further functional groups seems to be necessary for pentacyclic triterpene carboxylic acid derivatives to achieve sufficiently low EC50 values. Thus, the presence of an amino substituent in ring A leads to cytotoxic but unselective compounds. Simple carboxylic acid amides are often cytotoxic in micro polar concentrations and highly selective, whereas rhodamine B conjugates can reach EC50 values in the nano-molar concentration range but hold the risk of being highly cytotoxic for all types of cells.Among these derivatives, triterpenoids, which could be synthesized from triterpenic oximes through a Beckmann type rearrangement followed by a subsequent reduction reaction holding an A-azepane ring or a 3-amino-3,4-seco-4(24)-en-fragment are a group of new and promising modifications exhibiting anti-microbial, anticancer, alpha-glucosidase as well as butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities."
TA045385_M_0001,"The study involved seeding exponentially growing human cancer cell lines and non-malignant mouse fibroblasts into 96-well plates. After 24 hours, the cells were treated with serial dilutions of semi-synthetic triterpenoid compounds for 72 hours. The cells were then fixed with trichloroacetic acid, washed, and stained with sulforhodamine B dye. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm to determine cell viability. Dose-response curves were generated using a non-linear 4-parameter Hill-slope equation to calculate EC50 values.","In short, exponentially growing cells were seeded into 96-well plates on day 0 at the appropriate cell densities to prevent confluence of the cells during the period of experiment. After 24 h, the cells were treated with serial dilutions of the compounds (0–30 µM) for 72 h. The final concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0.5%, which was non-toxic to the cells. After a 72 h treatment, the supernatant medium from the 96-well plates was discarded, and the cells were fixed with 10% TCA. For a thorough fixation, the plates were allowed to rest at 4 °C. After fixation, the cells were washed in a strip washer. The washing was done four times with water using alternate dispensing and aspiration procedures. The plates were then dyed with 100 µL of 0.4% SRB for about 20 min. After dying, the plates were washed with 1% acetic acid to remove the excess of the dye and allowed to air-dry overnight. Tris base solution (200 µL, 10 mM) was added to each well and absorbance was measured at λ = 570 nm (using a 96 well plate reader, Tecan Spectra, Crailsheim, Germany). The percentages of surviving cells relative to untreated controls were determined. The EC50 values were averaged from three independent experiments performed each in triplicate calculated from semi logarithmic dose response curves applying a non-linear 4P Hills-slope equation (GraphPad Prism5; the variables top and bottom were set to 100 and 0, respectively)."
TA045385_M_0002,"To assess the mechanism of cytotoxicity, flow cytometry was performed using annexin V and propidium iodide staining.

TA045385_M_0003,"A high-throughput screening was conducted using the National Cancer Institute’s 60-cell panel. Compounds were initially tested at a single dose, and those showing significant growth inhibition were further evaluated at five concentrations. Cells were inoculated, treated, fixed with trichloroacetic acid, and stained with sulforhodamine B. Absorbance was measured to calculate growth inhibition (GI50), total growth inhibition (TGI), and lethal concentration (LC50).","The screening is a two-stage process, beginning with the evaluation of all compounds against the 60 cell lines at a single dose of 10−5 M. Compounds that exhibit significant growth inhibition are evaluated against the 60-cell panel at five concentration levels. The human tumor cell lines of the cancer-screening panel are grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. For a typical screening experiment, cells are inoculated into 96-well micro titer plates in 100 mL at plating densities ranging from 5000 to 40,000 cells/well depending on the doubling time of individual cell lines. After cell inoculation, the micro titer plates are incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO, 95% air, and 100% relative humidity for 24 h prior to addition of experimental drugs. After 24 h, two plates of each cell line are fixed in situ with TCA, to represent a measurement of the cell population for each cell line at the time of drug addition (Tz). Experimental drugs are solubilized in dimethylsulfoxide at 400-fold the desired final maximum test concentration and stored frozen prior to use. At the time of drug addition, an aliquot of frozen concentrate is dissolved and diluted to twice the desired final maximum test concentration with complete medium containing 50 mg/mL gentamicin. Additional four, 10-fold, or ½ log serial dilutions are made to provide a total of five drug concentrations plus control. Aliquots of 100 mL of these different drug dilutions are added to the appropriate micro titer wells already containing 100 mL of medium, resulting in the required final drug concentrations. Following drug addition, the plates are incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air, and 100% relative humidity. For adherent cells, the assay is terminated by the addition of cold TCA. Cells are fixed in situ by the gentle addition of 50 mL of cold 50% TCA (final concentration, 10% TCA) and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant is discarded, and the plates are washed five times with tap water and air dried. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) solution (100 mL) at 0.4% in 1% acetic acid is added to each well, and plates are incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After staining, unbound dye is removed by washing five times with 1% acetic acid and the plates are air dried. Bound stain is subsequently solubilized with 10 mM Trizma base, and the absorbance is read on an automated plate reader at a wavelength of 515 nM. For suspension cells, the methodology is the same except that the assay is terminated by fixing settled cells at the bottom of the wells by gently adding 50 mL of 80% TCA (final concentration, 16% TCA). Using the seven absorbance measurements [time zero (Tz), control growth (C), and test growth in the presence of drug at the five concentration levels (Ti)], the percentage growth is calculated at each of the drug concentrations levels. Percentage growth inhibition is calculated as:[(Ti_Tz)/(C_Tz)]_100 for concentrations for which Ti_Tz[(Ti_Tz)/Tz]_100 for concentrations for which Ti < TzThree dose response parameters are calculated for each experimental agent. Growth inhibition of 50% (GI50) is calculated from [(Ti_Tz)/(C_Tz)]_100 ¼ 50, which is the drug concentration resulting in a 50% reduction in the net protein increase (as measured by SRB staining) in control cells during the drug incubation. The drug concentration resulting in total growth inhibition (TGI) is calculated from (Ti ¼ Tz). The LC50 (concentration of drug resulting in a 50% reduction in the measured protein at the end of the drug treatment as compared to that at the beginning) indicating a net loss of cells following treatment is calculated from[(Ti_Tz)/Tz]_100¼_50Values are calculated for each of these three parameters if the level of activity is reached; however, if the effect is not reached or is exceeded, the value for that parameter is expressed as greater or less than the maximum or minimum concentration tested."
TA045385_R_0001,"The study evaluates the cytotoxic potential of A-ring azepano- and 3-amino-3,4-seco-triterpenoids derived from betulin, oleanolic, ursolic, and glycyrrhetinic acids. These compounds were synthesized and tested against various human cancer cell lines and non-malignant mouse fibroblasts using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Compound 11 emerged as the most cytotoxic but lacked selectivity. Flow cytometry revealed its mechanism of action involves apoptosis and late apoptosis. Further screening at the NCI-60 panel identified several compounds with submicromolar GI50 values and high cytotoxic activity, though selectivity varied. The study underscores the importance of the A-azepano-ring in triterpenoids for antitumor activity and suggests future modifications to improve selectivity.","In this study, a total of 20 A-ring azepano- 1–17 and 3-amino-3,4-seco- 18–20 triterpenoids were synthesized from betulin, oleanolic, ursolic, and glycyrrhetinic acids according to methods described earlier. Their structures are presented at Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4.The cytotoxicity of compounds 1–20 was evaluated by means of a colorimetric sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. For all compounds, the EC50 values were determined for the human tumor cell lines A375 (malignant melanoma), HT29 (colorectal carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), A2780 (ovarian carcinoma), FaDu (hypopharyngeal carcinoma), and NIH 3T3 (non-malignant mouse fibroblasts). The results are compiled in the Table 1.The results from the SRB assays showed all compounds of good cytotoxicity with EC50 values ranging between 0.88 µM (compound 11 for FaDu cells) and 7.92 µM (compound 2 for A375 cells). Compound 11 was the most cytotoxic of this series, but this compound showed little selectivity between the different human tumor cell lines as well as to non-malignant fibroblasts. Compound 6, however, was most cytotoxic for A2780 ovarian cancer cells (EC50 = 3.93 µM) but significantly less cytotoxic for non-malignant fibroblasts (NIH 3T3, 11.68 µM) thus resulting in a selectivity factor S (EC50 (NIH 3T3)/EC50 (A2780) of approximately 3 (Table 2). Due to its good cytotoxic properties, compound 11 was subjected to flow cytometric measurements (Annexin V/PI assay). Thereby, A375 cells were treated with 2 × EC50 concentrations of 11 for 48 h, and the results from these experiments are depicted in Figure 5.Thereby, the BL1-A signal corresponds to the FITC signal for annexin V (x-axis) while PI is detected at BL3-A (y-axis). Thus, cells in R1 correspond to necrotic cells, those in R2 to late apoptosis, cells in R3 are viable cells, and cells in R4 have died from apoptosis. Thus, from the 48 h incubation of 11, 44.3% of the A375 cells have died by apoptosis and 21.4% by late apoptosis. The number of necrotic cells remained small (1.1%).Taking into account the results of cytotoxicity of triterpenoids 1–20 against the five human cancer cell lines and non-malignant mouse fibroblasts, they were subjected to the NCI-60 Anticancer Drug Screening. Compounds 1–9, 11–17, 19, and 20 were selected by National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, Rockville, MD, USA) Developmental Therapeutic Program (DTP) and tested at one dose assay (10−5 M) towards a panel of approximately 60 cancer cell lines representing different cancer types: Leukemia, melanoma, lung, colon, CNS, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast cancers. Primary anticancer assays were performed according to the NCI protocol as described elsewhere (see e.g.,  (accessed on 16 October 2019)). The compounds were added at a single concentration and the cell cultures were incubated for 48 h. The end point determinations were made with a protein binding dye, sulforhodamine B (SRB). The results for each compound are reported as the percent growth (GP %) of treated cells compared to untreated control cells (negative numbers indicate cell kill). The range of percent growth shows the lowest and the highest percent growth found among the different cancer cell lines (Table 3 and Figures S1–S18 Supporting Material)."
TA045385_R_0002,"The anticancer activity of the azepano derivatives was found to depend on the triterpenic core structure. Compounds like azepanobetulin 1 and azepanoerythrodiol 3 showed broad activity, while others like azepanomessagenin 2 were inactive. Modifications such as double bonds or functional groups significantly influenced activity. For example, azepano-glycyrretol 5 was less active than its diene counterpart 6. Advanced assays revealed compounds 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 19, and 20 had submicromolar GI50 values and high LC50 values. Selectivity analysis showed compounds 3, 8, 11, 15, and 16 had moderate to high selectivity for specific cancer cell lines, such as leukemia and colon cancer. Comparisons with standard drugs like doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil indicated some compounds outperformed them in certain cell lines, highlighting their potential as novel antitumor agents.","The anticancer activity results showed that the cytotoxic effect of the studied azepano derivatives was directly dependent on the type of triterpenic core. So, the azepanomessagenin 2 did not show antiproliferative activity, while the azepanobetulin 1 and azepanoerythrodiol 3 were effective for 28 and 30 cancer cell lines. The anticancer activity of the azepano-glycyrretols was strongly influenced by the presence of an additional double bond in the triterpene core—thus, azepano-glycyrretol 5 was active only towards 8 human tumor cell lines, while diene 6 demonstrated a pronounced antiproliferative effect against the whole NCI-60 cancer cell line panel. Azepanouvaol 4 was also highly active against 57 cell lines. The transformation of azepanobetulin 1 into azepanoallobetulin 7 led to a significant increase in activity against 52 cancer cell lines, whereas the anticancer effect of abeo-lupanes 8 and 9 influenced by the position of the double bond. Thus, abeo-lupane 8 effectively acted against 55 cell lines, while its regio-isomer 9 was active only towards 36 lines. Modification at the C28 position of azepanobetulin derivatives increased the activity of the initial compounds—the introduction of a tosyl fragment (compound 12) led to activity against 39 cancer cell lines, and the amide fragment (compound 11) was effective against the all NCI-60 cancer cell line panel. At the same time, the introduction of amide fragments into the C28 position of the azepanotriterpenic alcohols 4 and 5 led to a general decrease of anticancer effect-amide 13 was active only towards 6 tumor cell lines, and amide 14-against 45 cell lines. Replacement of the hydroxyl group to tosyl as in compounds 15 and 16 also led to a decrease in antiproliferative activity-these compounds inhibited 22 and 40 cell lines, respectively. Oxidation of the double bond to a 12-oxo group (compound 17) led to a complete loss of cytotoxic activity, whereas 3-amino-3,4-seco-4(23)-en triterpenic derivatives of uvaol 19 and glycyrrhetol 20 showed an activity against 45 and 52 cancer cell lines, respectively.Finally, 15 A-azepano- 1, 3, 4, 6, 7–9, 11, 12, 14–16, and 3-amino-3,4-seco-triterpenoids 19, 20 were selected in an advanced assay against a panel of approximately sixty tumor cell lines at 10-fold dilutions of five concentrations (100 µM, 10 µM, 1 µM, 0.1 µM, and 0.01 µM). The percentage of growth was evaluated spectrophotometrically versus controls not treated with the test agents after 48-h exposure and using SRB protein assay to estimate cell viability or growth. Three antitumor activity dose-response parameters were calculated for each cell line: GI50—molar concentration of the compound that inhibits 50% net cell growth; TGI—molar concentration of the compound leading to the total inhibition; and LC50—molar concentration of the compound leading to 50% net cell death (presented in negative logarithm). Furthermore, mean graph midpoints (MG_MID) were calculated for each of the parameters, giving an average activity parameter over all cell lines for the tested compound. For the MG_MID calculation, insensitive cell lines were included with the highest concentration tested (see the Supporting Material Figures S19–S32 and Tables S1–S3).Thus, all compounds exhibited significant antiproliferative effect towards human cancer cell lines, and among them, the highest cytotoxic activity in five-dose testing mode screening was observed for compounds 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 19, and 20 with growth inhibitory (GI50) against the most sensitive cell lines at submicromolar concentrations (0.20–0.94 μM). Cytotoxic activity (LC50) of these compounds against the most sensitive cancer cell lines was also high (1–6 μM). The compounds 3 and 19 showed a broad spectrum of growth inhibition activity (GI50 < 10 μM) against all human tumor cells with average GI50/TGI/LC50 values of 3.83/15.49/39.56 µM (3), and 1.42/3.89/16.97 µM (20), respectively. Compounds 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 20 inhibited the growth of all tested cancer cell lines and showed inhibition activity (GI50 < 3 μM) against all human tumor cell lines with average GI50/TGI/LC50 values of 1.70/3.34/17.48 μM (1), 1.65/3.31/7.64 µM (4), 1.68/3.64/17.17 µM (7), 1.73/3.53/16.89 µM (8), 1.75/3.35/6.43 µM (9), 1.29/2.64/5.62 µM (11), 1.77/3.43/5.84 µM (12), 1.72/3.35/6.52 µM (14), 1.72/3.52/19.43 µM (16), and 1.66/3.36/17.30 µM (20), respectively. Compounds 6 and 15 demonstrated growth inhibition activity (GI50 < 15 μM) towards all cancer cell lines with average GI50/TGI/LC50 values of 4.21/13.17/41.94 µM (6) and 1.99/3.80/29.02 µM (15) (Tables S1–S3 Supporting Material). Mean GI50 values for these compounds in comparison with standard anticancer agent’s doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil are given at Table S3 Supporting Material.The selectivity index (SI) was calculated by dividing the full panel MG_MID60 (μM) of the compounds 1, 3, 4, 6–9, 11, 12, 14–16, 19, and 20 by their individual subpanel MG_MID of the cell line (μM) and is to be considered as a measure of the compounds’ selectivity (Table 4). Ratios between 3 and 6 mean moderate selectivity, ratios greater than 6 indicate high selectivity towards the corresponding cell line, while compounds not meeting either of these criteria are rated nonselective. In this context, the compounds 4, 6–9, 12, 14, and 20 in the present study were found to be nonselective at all the GI50, TGI, and LC50 levels (selectivity indexes 0.57–1.59, 0.66–1.52 and 0.17–2.95, respectively). Based on the selectivity ratio, compound 11 in the study was found to be moderate selective for a growth inhibition regarding the leukemia subpanel with a selectivity ratio at GI50 level of 3.79, otherwise, it was found lower selective against other cell panels. Compound 3 was moderately selective at the TGI and LC50 levels towards colon, CNS, prostate cancer, and melanoma (selectivity indexes 3.59–4.69 and 3.18–4.63, respectively), as well as compounds 1, 15, 16, and 19 at the LC50 level (selectivity indexes 3.09–4.81). Furthermore, derivatives 3, 8, 11, 15, and 16 demonstrated a certain selectivity profile towards some individual cell lines at GI50 and TGI levels. GI50 level was from 5.16 to 6.45 for HL (60)-TB, K-562, CCRF-CEM, RPMI-8226 (leukemia), HT29 (colon cancer), and OVCAR-4 (ovarian cancer). At the same time, TGI level of moderate selectivity was observed for compound 11 towards leukemia cell line HL(60)-TB (SI = 5.74). Selectivity indexes of compound 3 at TGI level was 5.93–14.89 for HCT-116 (colon cancer), SF-539, SNB-19, and SNB-75 (CNS cancer). However, for compound 3 high selectivity at GI50 level was observed only for leukemia cell line K-562 (SI = 9.56) (Table 5).A raw comparison of the activities of studied compounds with respect to the activity reported for the standard drugs doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil, used by NCI as control reflects that the activity displayed for these compounds was lower than for doxorubicin except for colon cancer HCT-15 and ovarian cancer NCI/ADR-RES (compound 11). Comparison of the compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 7–9, 11, 12, 14–16, 19, and 20 activities with 5-fluorouracil showed that the studied compounds were more active against cell lines of leukemia CCRF-CEM, HL(60)-TB (exception compound 4), K-562; NSCL cancer HOP-92, NCI-H226, and NCI-H522; CNS cancer SNB-75 (exception compounds 3 and 6); melanoma SK-MEL-2 and UACC-257; ovarian cancer OVCAR-4 (exception 3 and 6), OVCAR-5, and SK-OV-3; renal cancer RXF 393 (exception 3); prostate cancer PC-3 (exception 1); breast cancer MDA-MB-31/ATCC, HS 578T, BT-549, and T-47D. Furthermore, compound 11 also showed the best inhibition of colon cancer SW-620, CNS cancer SF-268, melanoma M14, ovarian cancer OVCAR-8, renal cancer 786-0 cell lines; compound 15—renal cancer TK-10; compound 19—CNS cancer SF-268, melanoma M14, SK-MEL-28, ovarian cancer IGROV1, OVCAR-8, renal cancer TK-10; compound 20—CNS cancer SF-268 and renal cancer TK-10 (Table S1 Supporting Material)."

TA022833_I_0001,"The introduction provides background on Inonotus obliquus (chaga) as a medicinal fungus, its traditional uses, and the bioactive terpenoids it produces, while outlining the study's aim to investigate terpenoid biosynthesis through transcriptomic analysis under different betulin sources.","**1. introduction** *Inonotus obliquus*, a member of the Hymenochaetaceae family of Basidiomycetes, is a medicinal fungus used in the traditional medicine of Native American and North Eurasian cultures. *I. obliquus*, commonly known as chaga or black diamond, is used by some Canadian First Nations to treat infections and tumors. Chaga is a black parasitic fungus that grows on the living trunks of the northern latitudes of America, Europe and Asia, and it is the primary pathogen of birch and other Betulaceae trees [\[1\]](#page-22-0). In nature, instead of a fruiting body, it usually forms an irregular shape of a sclerotial conk with the appearance of burnt charcoal, and it has been used for centuries as a folk medicine to treat and prevent multiple diseases. Over the last decade, studies have revealed that the extract of *I. obliquus* contains biologically active molecules derived from the specialized metabolism, supporting the effectiveness of chaga in traditional medicine. These specialized metabolites (e.g., polysaccharides, polyphenols and terpenoids) are responsible for *I. obliquus*'s medicinal effects including those of the antioxidant [\[1](#page-22-0)[–11\]](#page-22-1), antibacterial [\[1](#page-22-0)[,7](#page-22-2)[,12](#page-22-3)[,13\]](#page-22-4), anti-diabetic [\[14](#page-22-5)[–19\]](#page-22-6), and anticancer [\[16,](#page-22-7)[19](#page-22-6)[–37\]](#page-23-0) types. Terpenoids consist of a large and diverse class of chemicals among the multitude of metabolites produced by fungi. Fungi employ terpenoids for an array of primary functions (growth and development) and for specialized activities, chemical interactions, and protection against abiotic and biotic factors. *I. obliquus* produces a diverse range of bioactive terpenoids exhibiting compelling therapeutic activity (e.g., anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory). Among the bioactive terpenoids found in chaga, sesquiterpenoids (e.g., bergamotene, selinene, and santalene) and triterpenoids (e.g., betulin, betulinic acid, lanosterol, inotodiol, and trametenolic acid) have been identified [\[1,](#page-22-0)[35,](#page-23-1)[38–](#page-23-2)[43\]](#page-24-0). In addition, *I. obliquus* is able to catabolize metabolites from its birch host to grow and develop. White birch bark contains large amount of triterpenoids including betulin and betulinic acid, which represent up to 75% and 2% of the extractives, respectively [\[44](#page-24-1)[,45\]](#page-24-2). It is not clear if betulin and betulinic acid detected in *I. obliquus* sclerotia result only from fungal de novo synthesis, from the transformation of birch terpenoid metabolites, or from both. It has been shown that *I. obliquus* cells are able to produce these triterpenoids in a submerged culture, suggesting the presence of genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes involved in their de novo production [\[46\]](#page-24-3). However, the identification and regulation of these genes remain unknown. In fungi, terpenoid biosynthesis occurs via the mevalonate (MVA) metabolic pathway which can be divided into three parts (Appendix [A—](#page-17-0)Figure [A1\)](#page-18-0). The first part (precursor pathway) involves a series of enzymatic reactions converting acetyl-CoA to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are the precursors of all terpenoids. For the second part (the sesquiterpenoid pathway), the cytosolic farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) condenses two molecules of IPP with one molecule DMAPP head-to-tail sequentially to produce farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). FFP serves as a precursor for sesquiterpenoids, which are synthesized by terpene synthases and can be processed by other assorted enzymes. Lastly, the third part of the pathway involves reactions that catalyze the formation of three groups of triterpenoids: The amyrin-type, the lanosterol-type and the lupeol-type. In recent years, high throughput sequencing platforms such as the Illumina RNA-Seq have been developed to study the transcriptome of model and non-model species, including plants, animals and microorganisms. This advanced sequencing technology has proven to be a cost-effective, rapid and powerful tool for investigating new functional genes and for detecting differentially expressed genes in diverse species. Currently, there is no genome information available for the Inonotus species; hence, the molecular basis of terpenoid production has not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to use de novo transcriptomic to generate a comprehensive profile of the genes related to terpenoid production in an *I. obliquus* cell culture supplemented or not with terpenoid substrates. Moreover, a better understanding of the metabolic pathway for the synthesis of *I. obliquus* pharmaceutically-relevant metabolites such as betulinic acid, betulin and inotodiol will enable tools to increase the production of these valued metabolites. Chaga's host, i.e., white birch (*Betula papyrifera*), also produces betulin in high concentrations [\[47](#page-24-4)[,48\]](#page-24-5). It has been reported that the use of microorganisms isolated from the same sources as the host substrate would increase the probability of obtaining derivatives of this substrate using the bioconversion approach [\[49\]](#page-24-6). Related to that, the co-culture of chaga with white birch bark residues could increase the conversion of betulin trapped in birch bark into betulinic acid to valorize forestry residues on one side, and, on the other side, it could elucidate the relationships between chaga and white birch bark. In this study, the optimal growth conditions of *I. obliquus* cultured with or without betulin or white birch bark were investigated, and RNA was isolated. A cDNA library was then generated, and a whole transcriptomic analysis was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 4000. Whole-transcriptome was assembled de novo and analyzed, and differential expression studies confirmed by qRT-PCR unveiled the genes responsible for the terpenoid pathways in chaga."
TA022833_M_0001,"The study employed a combination of molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques to investigate the growth conditions and transcriptome of Inonotus obliquus. The methods included the use of HPLC-grade chemicals for purity, PCR and Sanger sequencing for fungal identification, and optimization of growth conditions in both liquid and solid media. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent, followed by Illumina sequencing for transcriptome analysis. The data were assembled de novo using Trinity, annotated with BLASTX and Trinotate, and validated with qRT-PCR to study gene expression involved in terpenoid biosynthesis.","Standard betulinic acid (97%) was purchased from Adipogen Corp. (San Diego, CA, USA). Standard betulin (98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Louis, MO, USA). Methanol, acetonitrile and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), ethyl acetate, and acetic acid were HPLC grade from Fisher Chemical. The other cited chemicals were of analytical grade. Media components (yeast extract, malt extract, agar, etc.) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Louis, MO, USA). I. obliquus was provided and cultured by the Biopterre laboratory (La Pocatière, Qc, Canada). The stock of I. obliquus was maintained on a potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium, and the stock culture was stored at 4 ◦C. The identity of the isolate was confirmed by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA region. The sequence data were deposited to the NCBI database under the GenBank accession number MN239482. To optimize the mycelial growth of I. obliquus in laboratory, yeast malt broth (YMB) and yeast malt agar (YMA) media were selected based on previous reported studies. The YMB and YMA contained 3 g/L of yeast extract and 3 g/L of malt extract. Different growth condition parameters of the liquid and solid culture of I. obliquus, were tested: Three pH (5, 6.2, and 7.5) and three temperatures (22 ◦C, 28 ◦C, and 37 ◦C) in presence or not of white birch bark (50 µg/mL) or betulin (15 µg/mL)."
TA022833_M_0002,"RNA was isolated from I. obliquus mycelium grown under different conditions, with quality assessed using Nanodrop and Bioanalyzer. High-quality RNA samples were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 4000, generating clean reads that were assembled de novo with Trinity. The assembled transcripts were annotated using BLASTX against the UniProt database and functionally characterized with Trinotate, including GO annotation. Differential gene expression was validated using qRT-PCR, targeting genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, with primers designed for specificity and efficiency.","Ten mL aliquote of 8 days I. obliquus liquid pre-culture were aseptically added to 250 mL flask containing 100 mL of a YMB medium supplemented or not with 0.2% DMSO (Control), 15 µg/mL of betulin (BET), or 50 µg/mL of white birch bark (WBB), and grown for 8 days on a rotary incubator at 150 rpm and 28 ◦C in absence of light. The I. obliquus mycelium was collected after 8 days of growth. The mycelium was filtered, frozen with liquid N2, and then placed in a 2 mL tube with 2 mL of TRIzol reagent (Fisher Scientific, Toronto, Canada). The mycelia were crushed using the TissueLyser II (QIAGEN, Qiagen Retsch GmbH, Hannover, Germany) using the stainless steel beads with 5 mm diameter (QIAGEN, Qiagen Retsch GmbH, Hannover, Germany) at speed of 30 strokes per second for 3 min until a homogeneous sample was obtained. The tubes were incubated on ice for 5 min, and then 400 µL of chloroform were added. The tubes were vigorously vortexed for 15 s and incubated in an ice bath for 3 min. After centrifugation at 13,000× g for 15 min at 4 ◦C, two phases were obtained, which were separated by cellular debris—the clear phase of the supernatant was recovered and transferred into another clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. RNA was precipitated with the addition of 700 µL isopropanol, followed by incubation at −20 ◦C for 3 h. Finally, precipitated RNA was collected by centrifugation at 13,000× g for 15 min at 4 ◦C, and the pellets were washed once with 1 mL of ice cold 75% ethanol and air dried briefly at room temperature. Then, they were centrifuged again at 13,000× g for 5 min at 4 ◦C. The RNA pellets were resuspended using 20 µL of nuclease free water. The quality and quantity of RNA extracted from the samples under different conditions were verified using the Nanodrop and the Bioanalyzer. Only samples with an RNA Integrity number higher than 8 were selected for Illumina sequencing. Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 4000, PE 100 paired ends, at McGill University and Genome Québec Innovation Centre (Montreal, QC, Canada) on cDNA Libraries converted from isolated high-quality mRNA. Among the raw reads obtained from Illumina sequencing, low quality reads, reads with unknown nucleotides, and reads with adapters were found. Trimmomatic was used to remove the adapters from sequencing and trimmed reads from the 3' end and further filtered all reads below 50 bp in order to obtain clean reads. However, once the data from the surviving pairs were generated, Trinity normalization was performed to remove redundant reads in datasets without affecting its k-mer content. De novo assembly of cleaned and standardized reads was performed using Trinity (v2.6.5) assembler. Trinity method assembles the RNA-Seq reads into full-length transcripts, which are called contigs or unigenes. All the unigenes were aligned to the public protein database uniprot_sprot.trinotate_v2.0.pep protein database using the BLASTX program against the NCBI BLAST families using an E-value of 10−5. Top BLAST hits were used for annotation of component/gene for each transcript. To quantify the gene transcript abundance, the raw RNA-Seq reads were mapped to assembled transcripts with Bowtie using default parameters. The gene transcript abundance was calculated as transcripts per kilobase million (TPM) using the RSEM package. Functional annotations of unigenes were performed using Trinotate, by aligning our transcripts to Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics databases (Swiss-Prot) with BLASTX and by identifying protein domains (HMMER/PFAM), protein signal peptides, transmembrane domains prediction (signalP/tmHMM), and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG). Then, the functional annotation of unigenes was compared to currently curated annotation databases (EMBL Uniprot eggNOG/GO Pathways databases). The Trinity assembly and functional annotation of unigenes were integrated as an annotation report into an SQLite database. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for our unigenes were obtained using the Swiss-Prot. The WEGO 2.0 software was used to obtain the GO functional classification for all unigenes and to better understand the distribution of gene functions in I. obliquus at the macro level. All annotated sequences were linked to the GO terms in the database, and a quantification of the number of sequences for each of the different terms was subsequently calculated. The raw reads under the accession number PRJNA526077 were deposited to the Sequence Read Archive. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed on I. obliquus in different culture conditions (control, with white birch bark (WBB) or with betulin (BET). The qRT-PCR assay was performed using a CFX connect Real-Time System by BioRad and analyzed using BioRad CFX Maestro 1.1. (BioRad laboratories) including statistics analysis using an ANOVA. Two micrograms of total RNA extracted from different culture conditions were reverse transcribed into single-stranded complementary DNA using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA™ Kit supplied by Thermo Fisher Scientific, following their protocol. qRT-PCR was performed in triplicates in a 10 µL total volume reaction containing 6 µL of SYBR Lo-ROX mix from Bioline SensiFAST SYBR Lo-ROX mix kit (FrogaBio, Toronto, ON, Canada), 2 µL cDNA and 2 µL of 200 µM of specific primers. The primers were designed using the conserved sequences of the variant of the transcripts selected using Clustal tool on Galaxy platform. The primers were aligned to the target genes sequences using the Integrated DNA Technology, Primer3 and Tm Calculator (New England Biolabs, tmcalculator.neb.com) to select suitable annealing temperatures for each primer. The qRT-PCR was performed for the following gene transcripts: Acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase A (HMGS); 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPS), squalene synthase (SQS), squalene monooxygenase (SQE), β-amyrin synthase (βAS) and lanosterol synthase (LAS). The primers used for the qRT-PCR assay are listed in Table 4. qRT-PCR data were standardized using reference genes. From the transcriptomic data of I. obliquus, we selected as reference genes, the two genes with lowest variability in their expression under the different culture conditions. The Ct values for the seven genes of interests were normalized to the Ct value of the reference gene centromere protein 3 (CEN3) and glutamine RNA ligase (GluRL). The amplification was carried out under the following conditions: 2 min of polymerase activation at 95 ◦C, followed by 39 cycles of 5 sec of denaturation at 95 ◦C, 10 sec of annealing, and 30 s of extension and fluorescence data acquisition at 72 ◦C were measured. After verifications of unique and clear melt curve and unique band obtained on agarose gel electrophoresis, RT-qPCR efficiency and linearity were taken into account for next step of qRT-PCR. The percentage of efficiency qRT-PCR was chosen between 90% and 110% and a standard curve correlation coefficient (R2) ≥96."
TA022833_R_0001,"The study investigates the toxicity of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil against Sitophilus zeamais adults through fumigation assays, revealing dose- and time-dependent mortality. LC50 values decreased over time (8.42 to 6.78 mg/L air), with terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol as the most potent constituents. Enzyme inhibition (AChE, GST, CarE) was observed, followed by partial recovery after 24 h. RNA-Seq analysis identified 3,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), enriched in metabolic and detoxification pathways, validated by qRT-PCR.","To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais. The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed. To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C). A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes). To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil. To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable."

The best growing conditions in liquid and solid cultures were determined for optimal production yield of Inonotus obliquus mycelia. It was found that optimal conditions were obtained at pH 6.2, 28 ◦C, and using YMB as a culture medium. In this study, we provide the first transcriptomic report generated by next-generation sequencing (Illumina HiSeq4000) of the medicinal fungus chaga, I. obliquus, grown under different conditions.

TA035884_I_0001,"The introduction highlights the challenges in pain management, the limitations of current analgesic drugs, and the potential of natural products like hecogenin and its derivatives as therapeutic alternatives, emphasizing their anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties.","Pain management remains one of the greatest challenges of contemporary medicine, nevertheless, there are a relatively limited list of treatment options for pain. Although a considerable number of analgesic drugs are available for the treatment of painful disorders, the search for development of new compounds as therapeutic alternatives continues since the available analgesic drugs exert a wide range of side effects. In this regard, opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been the main stay of pain treatment. Presently, there is concern that success in the development of new analgesic agents is limited. Although the expansion of synthetic medicinal chemistry in the last decades caused the proportion of new drugs based on natural products to drop to ~50%, 13 natural product–derived drugs were approved in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2005 and 2007, with five of them being the first members of new classes. For the treatment of pain the latest example of the natural product approved by FDA is Ziconotide (Prialt®), a peptide toxin obtained from Conus magus (marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae), and it is the first member in the new drug class of selective N-type voltage-sensitive calcium-channel blockers. Currently, because of their relatively low cost and easy availability in several countries (mainly developing countries), natural products could be used as synthetic models of more selective and powerful drugs. Hecogenin is a steroidal sapogenin largely drawn from the plants of the genus Agave (commonly known as ‘sisal’), and belongs to family Agavaceae, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. ‘Sisal’ species possess both commercial importance (as source of industrial fibers) and medicinal importance and they have been used in Chinese medicine for the treatment of scabies and tumors, as well as for painful and inflammatory conditions. The steroidal sapogenins obtained from ‘sisal’ species (mainly diosgenin and hecogenin) are important precursors used by the pharmaceutical industry for the synthesis of steroid hormones, such as adrenal cortical hormones (cortisone, cortisol, prednisolone, prednisone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, triamcinolone, etc.), sexual hormones (progesterone), and protein anabolic hormones (stanozolol, methandienone). However, there is little scientific information about the biological properties of hecogenin in painful and inflammatory conditions. Peana et al. demonstrated hecogenin reduced paw edema induced by carrageenin, but also produced gastric mucous lesions in higher doses. Cerqueira et al. proposed that the anti-inflammatory property of hecogenin was produced by COX-2 inhibition. Conversely, theses authors demonstrated that pretreatment with hecogenin produced significant gastroprotective profile mediated by K+ATP channels. Recently, our group reported that hecogenin acetate (HA) (Figure 1), a steroidal sapogenin-acetylated, possesses antinociceptive activity using the tail-flick test and suggested the possible involvement of descending pain-inhibitory mechanisms. Now, the antinociceptive effect of HA was investigated in inflammatory hyperalgesia models on mice, examining HA-evoked cFos immunoreactivity in spinal cords levels and cytokines enhancement by RT-PCR technique. We hypothesized that HA may be acting by spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms to produces anti-hyperalgesic profile and that the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines may contribute to this analgesic effect."
TA035884_M_0001,"The study was conducted under ethical approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Federal University of Sergipe, adhering to guidelines for laboratory animal care. Male Swiss mice were housed under controlled conditions and acclimatized before experiments. Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed using an electronic anesthesiometer to measure paw withdrawal responses. Mice were divided into groups treated with vehicle, hecogenin acetate (HA), indomethacin, or dipyrone, followed by injections of hyperalgesic agents (carrageenan, PGE2, dopamine, or TNF-α). Hyperalgesia was evaluated at multiple time points. The rota-rod test was used to rule out non-specific muscle-relaxant or sedative effects of HA, with diazepam as a reference drug.","All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (CEPA/UFS # 04/12) at the Federal University of Sergipe, and handling procedures were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH - National Institutes of Health) for the use of animals in pain research. Male Swiss mice (32–39 g), 2–3 months of age, were used throughout this study. The animals were randomly housed in appropriate cages at 21 ± 2 °C on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) with free access to food (Purina®, Brazil) and water. Before the experiments, the animals were acclimatized to the laboratory for at least 1h. Mice were used only once in each test. Experiments were carried out between 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. in a quiet room. All experiments involving the behavioral analysis were carried out by the same visual observer and in a double-blind manner. Mechanical hyperalgesia was tested in mice as reported by Cunha et al., with alterations as previously published. In a quiet room, mice were placed in acrylic cages (12 × 10 × 17 cm) with wire-grid floors 15–30 min before starting the test. This method consisted of evoking a hindpaw flexion reflex with a hand-held force transducer (electronic anesthesiometer, Model EFF 302, Insight®, Ribeirão Preto-SP, Brazil) adapted with a polypropylene tip. The investigator was trained to apply the tip perpendicularly to the central area of the hindpaw with a gradual increase in pressure. The end point was characterized by the paw withdrawal followed by clear flinching movements. After this response, the intensity of the pressure was automatically recorded. The intensity of stimulus was obtained by averaging four measurements performed with minimal intervals of 3 min. The animals were tested before and after treatments. Mice were divided into five groups (n = 8, per group), which were treated with vehicle (saline + tween 80, 0.2 mL for 1 mL - saline; i.p.), hecogenin acetate (HA, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg; i.p.), indomethacin (10 mg/kg; i.p.) or dipyrone (60 mg/kg; i.p.). Thirty min after treatment, 20 μL of carrageenan (300 µg/paw), PGE2 (100 ng/paw), DA (30 μg/paw) or TNF-α (100 pg/paw) were injected subcutaneously into the subplantar region of the hindpaw, as described by Cunha et al. and Villarreal et al.. The degree of hyperalgesia was evaluated at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h after the injection of hyperalgesic agents. To evaluate the possible non-specific muscle-relaxant or sedative effects of hecogenin acetate in the doses used, mice were submitted to the rota-rod test (AVS®, Brazil) according to Quintans-Junior et al.. The animals were selected 24 h previously by eliminating those mice which did not remain on the bar for two consecutive periods of 240 s. Mice were pre-treated with diazepam (DZP, 3 mg/kg, i.p., reference drug), HA (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (saline + Tween 80, 0.2 mL for 1 mL-saline, i.p.) and 1 h later were placed on a rotating rod. The latency to falling was measured up to 180 s. The results are expressed as the average time (s) during which the animals remained on the rota-rod apparatus in each group."

RNA was extracted from paw tissue to analyze cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10) and COX-2 gene expression using qRT-PCR. Statistical analysis was conducted using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test, with significance set at p < 0.05.","Ninety minutes after the intraperitoneal injection of HA at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/Kg or vehicle (Saline + Tween 80, 0.2 mL for 1 mL-saline), the animals (n = 6, per group) were perfused with phosphate buffer (0.01 M) saline isotonic (PBS) followed by 10% buffered formalin (100 mM). The spinal cord (L4-L6) were removed and stored at −80 °C for the imunofluorescence against Fos protein. The protocol for immunofluorescence was based on prior. Frozen serial transverse sections (20 µm) of the whole spinal cord were collected on gelatinized glass slides. After washing with PBS, the slices were incubated with 0.1 M glycine in PBS for 10 min. Non-specific protein binding was blocked by the incubation of the sections for 30 min in a solution containing 2% BSA. Then, the sections were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-Fos as primary antibodies (1:2000). Afterwards, the sections were incubated for 2 hr with donkey anti-rabbit IgG -Alexa Fluor 594 (1:2000). Sections were cover slipped with Fluoromount G. As a control for non-specific labeling, sections were incubated without primary antibody. After each stage, slides were washed with PBS five times for 5 min. Light level photomicrographs of spinal cord sections were acquired for each animal with an Axioskop 2 plus, Carl Zeiss®, Germany. Neurons were counted by the free software Image J (National Institute of Health) using a plug-in (written by the authors) that uses the same level of label intensity to select and count the Fos-positive cells. Mice were slightly anesthetized with halothane and received 10 µL of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA; 1 mg/mL of heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 85% paraffin oil and 15% mannide monoleate; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) subcutaneously in the plantar region of the right hind paw, according to a method reported previously. The transcription of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha), IL-1β (Interleukin 1 beta), IL-6 (Interleukin 6), IL-10 (Interleukin 10) and COX-2 (cyclooxygenase type 2) genes was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in mice sacrificed two hours after the CFA injection. Total RNA was isolated from the paw tissue with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, California, CA, USA), and the concentration was determined by photometric measurement. High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to synthesize cDNA from 1 μg of RNA following the manufacturer’s recommendations. qRT-PCR assays were performed to detect the expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and COX-2 genes. Amplification mixtures for qRT-PCR contained 20 ng template cDNA, 10 μL Taqman Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and probes in a final volume of 20 μL. All reactions were run in duplicate on an ABI7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) under standard thermal cycling conditions. Experiments with coefficients of variation greater than 5% were excluded. A no-template control (NTC) and no-reverse transcription controls (No-RT) were also included. The results are presented as the fold-increase of expression of the individual mRNAs, with the target internal control GADPH using the cycle threshold method. λ-Carrageenan, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), dopamine (DA), ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), Tween 80, fluoromount G, glycine and bovine serum albumin (BSA) and hecogenin acetate (HA, ~90% purity) were purchased from Sigma (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Indomethacin and dipyrone were purchased from União Quimica (Brazil). c-Fos Antibody, a rabbit polyclonal IgG, was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas, TX, USA) and Alexa Fluor® 488, a Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), was obtained from Life technology (Grand Island, New York, NY, USA). Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of measurements made on 6–8 animals in each group. Comparisons between three or more treatments were made using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test. In all cases, differences were considered significant if p < 0.05.

TA035884_R_0001,"The study investigates the anti-hyperalgesic effects of hecogenin acetate (HA) in mice, focusing on its ability to reduce mechanical hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory agents like carrageenan, TNF-α, dopamine, and PGE2. HA's mechanism involves inhibiting spinal cord excitability (via reduced Fos expression) and modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β), without affecting motor performance.","The current study shows that systemic administration of hecogenin acetate (HA) could able to reduced inflammatory hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner and its reduce fos expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord normally produced by carrageenan suggesting it reduces central excitability. As showed in Figure 2, intraplantar injection of carrageenan (300 µg/paw) induced a significant increase in the number of responses to 0.6 g force applied to the inflamed hindpaw when compared to baseline. The increased number of responses was maintained from 30 to 180 min after the carrageenan administration. The systemic administration of HA (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) produced an anti-hyeralgesic effect in this model. Specifically mice treated with HA, all doses, 30 min before carrageenan administration exhibited a significant reduction in the number of responses to repeated application of the 0.6 g mechanical force at all evaluated times, when compared with animals vehicle-treated (control group). As expected, the reference drug (indomethacin, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) showed reductions in the number of responses to the 0.6 g force (Figure 2A). The group of animals that received saline in the sub plantar region, instead of carrageenan, did not present any alteration on the threshold of sensitivity towards the mechanical stimuli (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of HA (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) on the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by TNF-α is shown in Figure 2B. Hecogenin acetate (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg) was able to reduce mechanical hyperalgesia induced by TNF-α, when compared with animals of the control group (vehicle-treated), similarly to the reference drug (indomethacin, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Figure 2C shows the inhibitory effect of HA on the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by dopamine. HA, in a higher dose, was able to reduce mechanical hyperalgesia induced by dopamine, when compared with animals of the vehicle group. Intraplantar administration of PGE2 induced a marked mechanical hypersensitivity that was significantly reduced by dipyrone (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and by hecogenin acetate at 5–20 mg/kg, as shown in Figure 2D. The analgesic potency of hecogenin acetate attributed to its ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines production and seems to be comparable to dipyrone and indomethacin at higher doses. However, future studies should further evaluate the potency of hecogenin acetate compared to other drugs reference."
TA035884_R_0002,"HA's anti-hyperalgesic effects are linked to its inhibition of inflammatory cascades, including cytokine modulation (IL-1β) and spinal cord neuronal hyperactivity (via Fos suppression). It does not alter TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, or COX-2 expression. HA's action may involve opioid pathways and descending pain modulation, supported by reduced Fos expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn without motor impairment.","Hyperalgesia induced by i.pl. injection of carrageenan is widely used for evaluating new anti-hyperalgesic drugs in rodents. In experiments using mice, injection of carrageenan into the plantar surface of animal hind paws produced inflammation and hyperalgesia with similar temporal profile. In this model, there is the occurrence of non-immunereaction, involving inflammatory mediators, including arachidonic acid products (PGE2), mast cells products (histamine, 5-HT), neuropeptides, cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα), NO, nerve growth factor (NGF), leukotrienes B4 (LTB4) and transcription factors (NF-κB). According to Cunha et al., this cascade of signalization leads to the release of prostanoids and sympathomimetic amines. Therefore, those final inflammatory mediators can activate peripheral Aδ and C fiber sensory nerve terminals, thus causing the release of substance P and neurokinin A, leading to increases in local blood flow and vascular permeability. Cytokines produced after i.pl. injection of carrageenan may exert in direct cytotoxic effects by the release of NO, reactive oxygen species, eicosanoids and excitatory amino acids (EAA - glutamate and aspartate) EAA. Alternatively, IL-1β induced by carrageenan might sensitize spinal neurons through the induction of nociceptive neuropeptides expression, such as substance P (SP) and nerve growth factor (NGF). It also has been shown that nociceptive stimulus induced by glutamate, PGs, histamine or 5-HT carrageenan-induced release resulted on direct nociceptors sensitization, culminating with simultaneous thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. We showed that acute HA administration, all doses, was able to reverse the hyperalgesic response induced by carrageenan, thus suggesting a possible inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cascade. It is well know that cytokine TNF-α is recognized as a potent pro-inflammatory endogenous substance, which is rapidly produced in large quantities by macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial infection. TNF-α interacts with target cells through high-affinity membrane receptors, as tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR1 or p55) and type 2 (TNFR2 or p75). Thus, TNF-α-induced hyperalgesia is mediated by prostanoids and sympathetic amines. We demonstrated that HA was able to reverse the hyperalgesic response induced by TNF-α, thus suggesting a possible inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cascade, as observed with the treatment with indomethacin. Taking those findings into account, we evaluated whether the antinociceptive activity of hecogenin acetate involves the blockade of sensitization or activation of the nociceptor through evaluation of its effect on hyperalgesia induced by PGE2 and dopamine. As the hyperalgesia induced by these mediators is independent of the final production of other inflammatory mediators or recruitment of cells, such as neutrophils and as it has been demonstrated that HA administration was able to maintain the baseline nociceptive threshold, we can then suggest the possibility that HA interacts with dopamine or EP receptors; consequently, the paths of its analgesic effects may be through the action not only at the inflammatory level but also from a possible involvement of neuronal pathways, as suggested by Brito et al. and Gama et al.. In fact, the acute pretreatment with hecogenin acetate increased threshold sensitivity towards mechanical stimuli in carrageenan-, TNF-α, PGE2- or dopamine-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, this compound is suggested to have produced an inhibition of the inflammatory cascade. Previously, Peana et al. and Cerqueira et al. have shown the antiedematogenic and anti-inflammatory effects of hecogenin, and they demonstrated that anti-inflammatory activity of hecogenin may be involvement inhibitory of cytokines pathway, at least partially. This hypothesis has been confirmed by our results of Real Time PCR analysis when we demonstrated that HA treatment could inhibit the expression of IL-1β (Figure 3). However, acute treatment with HA did not alter TNF-α (Figure 3B), and IL-6 (Figure 3C); and the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Figure 3D). In addition, Cerqueira et al. proposed that hecogenin, as non-acetylated, increased COX-2 expression in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rodents and who also suggest that hecogenin produces beneficial effect in gastric injury through mechanisms involving the inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration and lipid peroxidation, up-regulation of the COX-2/PG pathway and K+ATP channels. Differently, we demonstrated that acute treatment with HA was not able to change COX-2 expression, by assessed mRNA COX-2 levels (Figure 4). As it is well known, peripheral or central opioid receptor activation could lead to the decrease of the pain sensation towards an inflammatory stimulus, through the NO-cGMP-K+ATP channel pathway activation. Based on both suggestions that HA promotes regulation of K+ATP channels and the inhibitory effect of opioids on the spinal nociceptive transmission, and as our group has recently demonstrated, for the first time, that systemic administration of HA, at doses that did not induce motor performance alterations, produced consistent antinociceptive effect, probably mediated by opioid system and descending pain-inhibitory pathways activation, we investigated whether analgesic-like profile of HA was due to the involvement of spinal cord dorsal horn pathways through immunohistochemical approach. Ninety minutes after the intraperitoneal injection of HA, the average number of neurons showing Fos protein in the spinal cord dorsal horn was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced (Figure 5) at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/Kg when compared with control (Vehicle). The superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord, particularly substantia gelatinosa (SG), is a major projection site of small-diameter afferent nerve fibers that predominantly transmit nociceptive signals. SG neurons also receive descending inputs from the brainstem. Baba et al. demonstrated using an in vitro spinal cord slice preparation that peripheral inflammation can facilitate A-beta fiber-mediated synaptic inputs to dorsal horn of the spinal cord, mainly SG, and also produce an increase in c-fos expression. The protooncogene c-fos, when activated, makes the immunologically detectable nuclear protein Fos. A striking attribute of Fos is that it is rapidly expressed in central neurons after noxious stimuli. Previous studies demonstrated that the increased c-fos expression is a transient reaction of spinal neurons in painful conditions, as in chronic pain. The causes of that spinal cord nociceptive neuronal hyperactivity during certain types of pain remain unclear. It may derive from the constant barrage of peripheral input, but may also reflect impairments of descending modulation, as previously showed by HA. Anyway, the value of the analysis of Fos expression to monitor the nociceptive activity of large neuronal populations is solid. In addition, CNS-depressant drugs, such as gabapentin, frequently used as analgesic in some types of painful conditions, inhibit glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission at the spinal dorsal horn and decrease Fos expression when they produce analgesic effect. Thus, our results suggests that the inhibition of neuronal hyperactivity at the spinal cord dorsal horn (by a significantly decrease of Fos expression) could account for the analgesic efficacy of hecogenin acetate, in all doses tested, in carrageenan-induced inflammatory nociception. Hence, it may also decrease neuronal activation at the spinal cord horn, by depressing descending facilitation through periaqueductal gray (PAG) activation, as previously demonstrated by our group. Earlier studies suggested that the CNS depression and the non-specific muscle relaxation effects can reduce the response of motor coordination and might invalidate the behavioral test results, including mechanical hyperalgesic tests. Since Brito et al. showed the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of hecogenin and as these activities can induce impair in motor coordination, we assessed that acute treatment with HA, at the doses tested, did not have any performance alteration in the rota-rod apparatus (data no shown)."
TA035884_C_0001,"The study investigates the anti-hyperalgesic effects of hecogenin acetate (HA), a steroidal sapogenin-acetylated derived from Agave plants, in mice. HA demonstrated significant inhibition of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan, TNF-α, dopamine, and PGE2. It also reduced Fos-like expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn and lowered pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β levels, suggesting spinal cord-inhibitory and cytokines-modulatory mechanisms. HA did not impair motor performance, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent for pain management.","Title: Evidence for the involvement of spinal cord-inhibitory and cytokines-modulatory mechanisms in the anti-hyperalgesic effect of hecogenin acetate, a steroidal sapogenin-acetylated, in mice. Abstract: Hecogenin is a steroidal sapogenin largely drawn from the plants of the genus Agave, commonly known as 'sisal', and is one of the important precursors used by the pharmaceutical industry for the synthesis of steroid hormones. Hecogenin acetate (HA) is a steroidal sapogenin-acetylated that produces antinociceptive activity. Thus, we evaluate the antihyperalgesic profile of HA in mice in inflammatory models, as well as its possible involvement with c-fos expression on spinal cord area and cytokines to produces analgesic profile. Acute pretreatment with HA (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg; i.p.) inhibited the development of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan, TNF-α, dopamine and PGE2. Additionally, the immunofluorescence data demonstrated that acute pretreatment with HA, at all doses tested, significantly inhibited Fos-like expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn normally observed after carrageenan-inflammation. Moreover, HA did not affect the motor performance of the mice as tested in the Rota rod test. This antinociceptive profile seems to be related, at least in part, to a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as IL-1β. The present results suggest that HA attenuates mechanical hyperalgesia by blocking the neural transmission of pain at the spinal cord levels and by cytokines-inhibitory mechanisms."
TA035884_C_0002,"The discussion highlights HA's significant anti-hyperalgesic effects in animal models, attributing its mechanism to modulation of spinal cord dorsal horn activity and inhibition of IL-1β expression. While these findings suggest HA's potential for clinical pain management, the authors acknowledge that other unexplored central or peripheral mechanisms may also contribute to its analgesic effects, warranting further research.","Discussion: Together, our results clearly indicate that HA displays significant anti-hyperalgesic effect in animal protocols. The precise mechanism by which HA promotes its effects is not clear, but the compound’s ability to modulate spinal cord dorsal horn and inhibit IL-1β expression appear to be likely one of the possible mechanisms. However, it is possible that another central or peripheral mechanism, not studied in present work, may be related to the analgesic effect of hecogenin acetate. Therefore, this steroidal sapogenin may be of potential interest in the development of new clinically relevant drugs for the management of painful conditions."
TA039067_I_0001,"The introduction outlines the global prevalence and challenges of epilepsy, including pharmaco-resistance, comorbidities, and cognitive side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), while emphasizing the need for alternative therapies such as medicinal plants like Lavandula dentata L. due to their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties.","Epilepsy is among the most prevalent and incapacitating neurological conditions. With a high rate of pharmaco-resistance, a variety of comorbidities (including progressive cognitive and behavioral disorders), and increased mortality from direct (e.g., sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, accidents, drowning) or indirect effects of seizures and therapies, it is a prevalent disorder that impacts more than 70 million people globally. Considerable investigation utilizing animal models and human subjects has yielded restricted knowledge regarding the mechanisms that underlie epileptogenesis and seizures; furthermore, these findings have not resulted in substantial reductions in pharmaco-resistance, morbidities, or mortality. Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent, unprovoked episodes of seizures due to a disorder in the synchronized activity of neurons. Specific brain regions may experience a neurochemical imbalance due to uncontrolled status epilepticus (SE). Excessive production of free radicals has been linked to the development of neuronal hyperactivity and/or excitotoxicity. The term “epilepsy” describes a group of illnesses characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures that appear to be the result of complicated processes involving numerous neurotransmitter systems, including glutamatergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems. It is brought on by sporadic, highly coordinated electric neuronal bursts that affect the brain’s tiny or large neuronal networks, impairing mental function, movement, awareness, or a combination of these symptoms. Several novel antiepileptic medicines (AEDs) have been approved for the treatment of seizures. The prevention of seizures is the primary goal of AED medication. As a result, once patients have achieved a seizure-free state, avoiding even a single seizure revolution occurrence is critical. Individuals with epilepsy, particularly those who are seizure-free, require consistency and certainty in their AED prescription to avoid breakthrough seizures. About 25% of epileptic individuals have drug-resistant epilepsy. Their weak control over epileptic seizures (ESs) puts them at risk for early mortality, trauma, and psychological problems, and it also lowers their quality of life. Four percent of adult cases of drug-resistant epilepsy go into remission each year; rates are higher in children. However, recurrence of ES is possible at any time. Therefore, to start the pre-surgical evaluation process, it is essential to identify patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and decide on other prospective therapeutic alternatives in specialized units or centers. While antiepileptic medicine has been shown to enhance cognitive function, it is essential to note that it is also associated with a significant incidence of cognitive adverse effects. Mental side effects are therapeutically substantial in that they may affect treatment adherence, long-term memory retention, various aspects of daily functioning, and overall health-related quality of life. While antiepileptic medicine has been shown to enhance cognitive function, it is essential to note that it is also associated with a significant incidence of cognitive adverse effects.

The present analysis assesses and evaluates the subject matter."
TA039067_I_0002,"The introduction highlights the potential of medicinal plants, particularly Lavandula dentata L., as alternative or adjunct therapies for epilepsy due to their phenolic compounds, antioxidant properties, and neuroprotective effects, while also discussing the historical and industrial uses of Lavandula species and their essential oils.","One of the key areas of research right now is looking for new antiepileptic drugs that can also protect neurons. Using plants and plant extracts to treat illness is an example of a therapeutic method. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), traditional techniques, primarily using plants, provide healthcare for approximately 75% of the world’s population. Therefore, the folk medicines that were turned into natural medicines have been essential in the progress of modern drugs. It can be utilized to find an alternate source of AEDs with innovative structures and enhanced safety and effectiveness profiles. It can also be combined with low-dosage medications. Medicinal plants are good at treating various illnesses because they contain several active chemicals, mainly phenolic products like flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, stilbenes, and others. Several substances have been shown to have antioxidant qualities. They might help protect against the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species. The genus Lavandula belongs to the Labiatae family (Lamiaceae). Lavandula species can be found all around the Mediterranean region and are grown in France, Spain, and Italy. The perfume, cosmetic, flavoring, and pharmaceutical industries all depend on the essential oil of Lavandula species. Lavender oils (LOs) are primarily used as raw materials in industrial perfume and fragrance products, with most lavender oils used this way. Malcolm and Tallian discovered that LO oral solutions help people feel calm and relaxed more quickly than first-line anxiety medications such benzodiazepines and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. As Sayorwan, Siripornpanich say, this calm effect is caused by LO’s impact on the autonomous nervous system (ANS). Essential oils are attracting more attention lately as a way to treat several nerve illnesses. The biological effect of L. dentata oil could partly be explained by an inhibitory action on NMDA glutamate receptors. Therefore, it was found that LEO can improve learning and memory in Alzheimer’s Disease via AMPA glutamate receptors. Lavandula dentata has recently had a long history of traditional medicinal use in medical treatments, adding flavor to recipes or infusions and culinary applications. L. dentata has been reported to be used for food therapy, intestinal issues, respiratory infections, and cough problems. Its essential oils are used in aromatherapy for calming and relaxing properties. Furthermore, L. dentata is recognized for its anti-arthritic properties, which help reduce arthritis and inflammation. On the other hand, L. dentata essential oil is known for its antibacterial, diuretic, and healing properties. It is commonly used in infusion or decoctions to treat cold symptoms and infections such as renal coli. However, until today, there were no reports on the neuroinflammatory, histopathological alterations, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and FoxP3+ Treg cell activities of Lavandula dentata L. in the case of an epileptic rat model. Therefore, the novel objectives of the current study were to evaluate the antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties of the ethanolic extract and essential oils derived from Lavandula dentata L in a rat model and study its ability to modulate FOXP3+ regulatory T cells and restore immune balance, which was not previously documented."

The rats were divided into five groups: control, epileptic, epileptic treated with valproic acid, epileptic treated with Lavandula dentata oil, and epileptic treated with Lavandula dentata ethanol extract. The plant material was collected, authenticated, and extracted using ethanol and ultrasonic assistance. Seizures were induced using pilocarpine hydrochloride, and the rats' behavior was monitored for seizure activity.","Forty mature male Wister rats, weighing 150–180 g, were obtained from the animal laboratory at the National Research Institute in Dokki, Giza, Egypt. The subjects were housed in separate metabolic cages within a controlled environment, maintaining a temperature of 23 ± 1 °C and a humidity level of 55%. The lighting conditions followed a 12 h light/dark cycle. A wide range of drinks and food was readily accessible. The experimental protocols adhered to the guidelines for the care and utilization of laboratory animals and were adequately reviewed by the animal research ethics committee of Beni-Suef University, with the assigned approval number BSU/FS/2021/021/138.The pharmaceuticals and chemicals utilized in this study included pilocarpine hydrochloride (99%) (PILO), which was procured from MP Biomedicals located in Solon, OH, USA (SKU:02151892-CF). Valium and methylscopolamine were procured from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., located in Nanjing, China. The valproic acid, specifically the brand Depakine Chrono®500 mg, was purchased from Sanofi Aventis CO., Paris, France a pharmaceutical company. The valproic acid falls under the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code N03AG01.Aerial parts of Lavandula dentata L. were collected from the Taif region in Saudi Arabia in May 2018 when the plant was still growing. A voucher specimen was deposited in the herbarium. In contrast, it was identified, authenticated, and described with the aid of the Flora & Phyto-Taxonomy Research, Horticultural Research Institute, Agricultural Research Centre 12618, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt. Briefly, extraction and characterization of Lavandula dentata L.: About 250 whole dried plant material was coarsely milled and extracted with 70% ethanol via ultrasonic assistant extraction bath at room temperature till exhaustion (3 times). The pooled ethanol extracts were evaporated under a vacuum at 45 °C till evaporation of the organic solvent, and part of the remaining aqueous extract was freeze-dried to produce 47 g of greenish residue. Chemical component identification was accomplished by comparing mass spectra with genuine standards from the NIST/EPA/MSDC Mass Spectral Database and retention indices concerning alkanes (C8–C20). Peak area normalization was used to generate quantitative data without the need for correction factors).Seizure induction was applied according to Turski, Ikonomidou, and Abdel-Reheim. Briefly, before receiving 300 mg/kg of pilocarpine hydrochloride (PILO), each study rat received a dose of 1 mg/kg of methylscopolamine for 30 min. Rats’ behavior was observed for 120 min to determine whether or not specific criteria were met for seizure activity. An epileptic’s ability to exhibit symptoms of convulsions, tremors, salivation, and drowsiness was one of the conditions for becoming a good model."

Brain tissue samples were fixed, sectioned, and stained for histological examination. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect FOXP3-positive cells. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software to compare group means.","Forty grown male Wister rats weighing between 150 and 180 g were used in this study. They were split into five groups of eight rats each. The groups were as follows: (1) The control group (C) was fed a standard meal and had unlimited access to sterile water. At the same time as the treatment groups, they were orally administered PBS (pH 7.4; 0.2 mL/rat) via an intragastric tube. (2) Epileptic group (EP) was given 300 mg/kg of PILO injection, as previously described. (3) The group of epileptic rats treated with valproic acid (EP-VPA) was administered by the drug via intragastric intubation. Following this, they received an injection of 300 mg/kg of PILO, as described in earlier studies (Raza, Dhariwal and Ortinski and Meador). Additionally, the rats were orally fed 500 mg/kg of VPA diluted in PBS (pH 7.4; 0.2 mL/rat). The VPA sessions were conducted twice a week for a consecutive duration of four weeks, agreeing with the scheduling pattern observed in the other groups. (4) The epileptic group receiving L. dentata pure oil treatment (EP-LO): Following the previously mentioned injection of 300 mg/kg of PILO, the rats were given an oral diet containing 100 μg of L. dentata oil per kilogram of body weight, suspended in PBSS (pH 7.4; 0.2 mL/rat). Using intragastric intubation, the oil feeding was carried out every day for four weeks at intervals consistent with the other groups. (5) The epileptic group receiving L. dentata pure oil treatment (EP-LX): Following the previously mentioned injection of 300 mg/kg of PILO, rats were fed a liquid containing 300 mg/kg of ethanol extract of L. dentata mixed with PBSS (pH 7.4; 0.2 mL/rat). The extract feeding was carried out every day for four weeks at intervals consistent with the other groups by inserting a tube into the stomach.Neurotransmitters and electrolytes were assessed in the hippocampal area of the brain, which was cut open and put on plates filled with ice. A Potter–Elvehjem homogenizer (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was used to mix pieces of hippocampal tissue in cold PBS (pH 7.4) with eight up and down strokes of a loose-fitting Teflon pestle with a weight of 1000 g. After filtering, the mixture was put in a Beckman TJ-6 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments; Munich, Germany) and spun at 600× g for 10 min at 4 °C. At −80 °C, the clear supernatant was kept until many papers were examined. The amount of total protein in the supernatant (/gm tissue) was determined. Portions of brain tissue slices were stored at −80 °C in sterile Eppendorf tubes until they were needed for RT-PCR analysis and RNA extraction. The procedure for making neurotransmitters followed the purchased manufacturer’s instructions. Levels of L-DOPA (µg/mL), epinephrine (ng/mL), norepinephrine (pg/mL), glutamate (µg/mL), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, pg/mL) were measured using assay kits from MyBioSource Co. Vancouver, British Columbia: MBS 9357024, MBS 031232, MBS 269993, MBS 047402, and MBS 269152 were the kit catalog numbers. Acetylcholinesterase (U/L) activity was measured by following the instructions provided with the QuantiChromTM Assay Kit (Cat. No. DACE-100). The electrolyte content of both potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) (mMol/L) were measured in either brain homogenate tissue or blood, according to the MyBioSource handbook. In addition, QuantiChromTM assay’s quantitative colorimetric instruction booklet was also utilized to determine the amounts of calcium (Ca++) and chloride (Cl−) in brain homogenate tissue or blood.Prooxidant and antioxidant activities were assessed in brain homogenate tissues by the production guide purchased from MyBioSource Co. and included with the test kits. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was discovered in the hippocampal region to indicate lipid peroxidation. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) in tissue samples were quantified as malondialdehyde (MDA) using spectrophotometry. Nitric oxide (NO) accelerates the conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, which can be monitored via spectrophotometric measurement. The GPx activity was measured using T-butyl-HPx as a substrate. The quantity of nitro blue tetrazolium (NitroBT) that was decreased with NADH by phenazine methosulfate (PMS) under aerobic circumstances was used to determine the amount of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Adding or being in the presence of superoxide dismutase stopped this reaction. One way to measure catalase (CAT) activity is to watch the loss of H2O2 using spectrophotometry.The process of isolating RNA and performing PCR was done using real-time quantification. The SYBR Green I analysis was conducted using an implemented BioSystem with software version 3.1 (StepOneTM, USA). The qPCR test designates the target primer sequence at a temperature of 60 °C for one minute, which agrees with the annealing temperature. The denaturation temperature was set at 95 °C for one minute, while the extension temperature was maintained at 72 °C for the same duration. This was done 40 times. The comparative threshold (CT) method was used to measure gene expression compared to other genes. The numbers were worked out after comparing the changes in mRNA transcript level to GAPDH. Each experiment was done three times, each time on its own. PCR (RT–PCR) with the following rat-specific primers: Spectrophotometry is used to track the SCN1A (Na+ channel) of H2O2: F; 5-TCATGGCACAGTTCCTGTATC-3; R; 5-GCAGTAGGCAATTAGCAGCAA-3; Kcnj2 (K+ channel): F; 5-GCAAACTCTGCTTGATGTGG-3; R; 5-TCATACAAAGGGCTGTCTTCG-3; CACNA1S (Ca2+ channel): F; 5-GACATAATTCCCGCTGCCTG-3; R; 5-GTTTCCATTCTTCACCCGCC-3; CLCN2 (GABA-receptor): F; 5-CACTGGATAACAACGCCCA-3; R; 5-GCAGGGAATGTAGGTCTGG-3; NMDA (Glutamate Receptor): F; 5-ACTCCACACTGCCCATGAAC-3; R; 5-TTGTTCCCCAAGAGTTTGCTT-3; FOXP3: F; 5-TCATCCGCTGGGCCATCCTG-3; R; 5-GTGGAAACCTCACTTCTTGGTC-3; CTLA4: F; 5-GGACGCAGATTTATGTCATTGATC-3 and R; 5-CCAAGCTAACTGCGACAAGGA-3; and GAPDH: F; 5-GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3; R; 5-CAATGCCAGCCCCAGCG-3.Brain tissue samples were taken and put in a 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) to keep them still for 24 h. To sum up, tap water was used to wash the tissues, and then a run of diluted ethyl alcohol was used to dry them out. Animal parts were cleaned with xylene and then put in a hot oven at 56 °C for 24 h to bury in paraffin. To cut the tissue into five μm slices with a microtome (Leica Microsystems, San Francisco, CA, USA), paraffin wax blocks were first made. The tissue sections were placed onto glass slides and subjected to deparaffinization using xylene, followed by hydration using a sequential sequence of alcohols with concentrations of 100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, and 70%. Subsequently, the specimens were immersed in water and subjected to staining using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) obtained from Sigma. The slides were subsequently examined using a conventional light microscope manufactured by Olympus Optical Corporation in Tokyo, Japan. The scoring system utilized in this study assessed brain alterations, specifically nuclear pyknosis and degeneration in neurons, localized gliosis, and encephalomalacia, on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 (0 meant the brain was normal, 1 meant mild damage, 2 meant moderate damage, and 3 meant severe damage).All possible quantifications for the image analysis were done for the studied layers, e.g., the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus regions. All cells count measurements were performed using the program ImageJ (), and the cell density, number of blood vessels, and layer thickness were examined in all H&E images (six fields/rat/group). The number of cells per unit area (cells/µm2) was also determined, while the fluctuations were measured and tracked. A thorough examination of the differences in cell density between the various rat groups was made possible by this methodical approach, which enabled us to acquire consistent data for the groups.The primary and secondary antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA), which included anti-FoxP3 (Cat. #: AB75763) as the primary antibody and Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (DyLight 488 pre-adsorbed, AB96899) as the secondary antibodies. Immunohistochemistry (Formalin/PFA-fixed paraffin-embedded sections) was performed on rat brain tissue staining FOXP3 using antibody CAT # ab75763 with final conc. 1/100, DAB staining (in brown) and hematoxylin QS as a counterstain (in blue). ImageJ software was used to analyze the histoarchitecture of the FOXP3-positive cells. Six animals were used in each experimental group to gather quantitative data; each animal had 3 to 4 high power fields to be examined, and the values were averaged to represent the animal.The Shapiro–Wilk test was utilized to verify if the current data were expected. Means and standard deviation were employed because the data were regularly distributed. If there was no homogeneity of variance, the Welch Test, a modified ANOVA, was used. The Tukey–Kramer method was employed for doing post hoc analysis of the data, to compare various groups. The means of homogenous subsets’ groups are presented, with each value represented as Mean ± Std and a sample size of n = 8 animals per group. A notable statistical contrast at a significance level of p < 0.05, relating to the same variable and lacking a shared superscript symbol or symbols, was indicated. The data analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20 software program (IBM Corp., 2011)."

It highlights the limitations of current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and the need for alternative therapies. The research investigates the effects of L. dentata on electrolyte levels, monoamines, neurotransmitters, and ion channel expression, as well as its role in restoring Treg/Th-17 cytokine balance and Treg markers like FOXP3 and CTLA-4.","Title:Therapeutic Efficacy of Lavandula dentata's Oil and Ethanol Extract in Regulationof the Neuroinflammation, Histopathological Alterations, Oxidative Stress, andRestoring Balance Treg Cells Expressing FoxP3+ in a Rat Model of Epilepsy. Abstract:Background/Objectives: Despite the availability of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)that can manage seizures, they often come with cognitive side effects.Furthermore, the role of oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory responses inepilepsy and the limitations of current AEDs necessitate exploring alternativetherapeutic options. Medicinal plants, e.g., Lavandula dentata L., are rich inphenolic compounds and may provide neuroprotective and anti-inflammatorybenefits. However, limited research evaluates their effectiveness in modulatingneuroinflammation and histopathological changes in epilepsy models. Therefore,the current study hypothesized that treating Lavandula dentata L. extract oressential oils may reduce neuroinflammatory responses and mitigatehistopathological changes in the brain, providing a natural alternative oradjunct therapy for epilepsy management. Methods: Five groups of male Wistar ratswere used: control, pilocarpine-treated epileptic, valproic acid (VPA-treatedepileptic), L. dentata extract, and essential oils. Numerous electrolyte levels,monoamine levels, neurotransmitter levels, and the mRNA expression of specificgate channel subtypes were evaluated in homogenate brain tissue. Additionally,histological changes in various brain regions were investigated. Results: Theinvestigation revealed that the extract and essential oils obtained from L.dentata L. exhibited the ability to improve the modulation of electrolytes andions across voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Furthermore, it was revealedthat they could decrease neuronal excitability by facilitating repolarization.Moreover, L. dentata's oil and ethanol extract re-balances T-reg/Th-17 cytokines,restoring the pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and Treg markers, e.g., FOXP3 andCTLA-4, to their normal level. Conclusions: The present work confirms that theextract and essential oils of L. dentata L. have different activities toameliorate the progression of histopathological alterations. Therefore, when usedin conjunction with other AEDs, the extract and essential oils of L. dentata canslow the progression of epileptogenesis."
TA039067_C_0002,"The discussion emphasizes Lavandula dentata's ability to enhance antioxidant enzymes like GSH, SOD, and CAT, protecting against oxidative stress induced by PTZ. It also highlights its potential to reduce inflammatory cytokines and protect neurons and microglia. The study notes the lack of prior research on L. dentata's impact on FoxP3+ Treg cells in epilepsy models but suggests its potential to restore Th17/Treg balance. Practical applications include integrating L. dentata into therapeutic regimens, neuroprotective supplements, and phytopharmaceuticals to enhance seizure control and mitigate AED side effects.","Discuession:Lavandula dentata enhances the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as GSH, SOD, and CAT, protecting against oxidative stress generated by PTZ. L. dentata could reduce inflammatory cytokines’ effects and protect neurons and microglia against inflammation. Currently, no research specifically investigates the impact of L. dentata oil and ethanol extracts on FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in a rat model of epilepsy. However, the available data suggests that L. dentata’s oil and extract may benefit by restoring the balance between pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and anti-inflammatory Treg cells, including those expressing Foxp3. Therefore, based on the current study’s findings, the practical applications of Lavandula dentata extracts include their integration into therapeutic regimens, neuroprotective supplement use, and the development of phytopharmaceuticals. These extracts could enhance seizure control and mitigate cognitive side effects if used alongside standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to enhance seizure control while mitigating cognitive side effects often associated with AEDs. Moreover, Lavandula dentata supplementation could also be used as a natural way to support brain health in individuals with seizures or neurodegenerative conditions."
TA003702_I_0001,"The introduction provides an overview of essential oils, their historical uses, and their broad-spectrum biological activities, including antimicrobial, antiparasitic, insecticidal, antiviral, antifungal, and antioxidant properties, as well as their potential as natural food preservatives.","Essential oils are aromatic and volatile liquids extracted from plant material, such as flowers, roots, bark, leaves, seeds, peel, fruits, wood, and whole plant [Deans and Ritchie, 1987; Hammer et al., 1999; Sánchez et al., 2010]. Essential oils have been used for centuries in medicine, perfumery, cosmetic, and have been added to foods as part of spices or herbs. Their initial application was in medicine, but in the nineteenth century their use as aroma and flavor ingredients increased and became their major employment. Almost 3000 different essential oils are known, and 300 are used commercially in the flavor and fragrances market [Burt, 2004]. Essential oils are considered to be secondary metabolites and important for plant defense as they often possess antimicrobial properties [Fraenkel, 1959; Tajkarimi et al., 2010]. The antibacterial properties of secondary metabolites were first evaluated using essential oil vapors by De la Croix in 1881 [Burt, 2004]. Since then, essential oils or their components have been shown to not only possess broad-range antibacterial properties [Deans and Ritchie, 1987; Oussalah et al., 2007], but also antiparasitic [George et al., 2009], insecticidal [Essam, 2001; Kim et al., 2003], antiviral [Schnitzler et al., 2011], antifungal [Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Kalemba and Kunicka, 2003; Silva et al., 2011; Tserennadmid et al., 2011], and antioxidant [Brenes and Roura, 2010] properties. Furthermore, they also function as growth enhancers for animals [Brenes and Roura, 2010; Ahmadifar et al., 2011]. Although the food industry primarily uses essential oils as flavorings, they represent an interesting source of natural antimicrobials for food preservation. However, application of essential oils as food preservatives requires detailed knowledge about their properties, i.e., the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the range of target organisms, the mode of action, and the effect of food matrix components on their antimicrobial properties. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of current knowledge about the antimicrobial mode of action of essential oil constituents, and to identify research avenues that can facilitate implementation of essential oil constituents as natural food preservatives in foods."
TA003702_M_0001,The article discusses various experimental approaches to investigate the antimicrobial mode of action of essential oils and their constituents. High-resolution microscopy techniques such as electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy are used to visualize cell deformation and ultrastructural changes. Fluorescent labeling is employed to identify specific cellular structures. The efflux of intracellular ions like potassium and hydrogen is measured to assess membrane functionality. Membrane permeability changes are detected using dyes like ethidium bromide and propidium iodide. Radiolabeled substrates are incorporated to study intracellular biosynthesis pathways. Transcriptome and proteome analyses are conducted to understand cellular responses to antimicrobial compounds at sublethal concentrations.,"High-resolution microscopy, such as electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy (AFM), can reveal the most extreme consequences of exposure to an antimicrobial compound, i.e., deformation of cells occurring from lysis or from damages to the cell wall. An advantage of TEM is that ultra-thin cross sections can reveal ultrastructural changes in the interior of the cell. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AFM only image the cell surface. AFM has one important advantage over electron microscopy, in that it allows measurements in liquid under physiological conditions, avoiding difficult sample preparation and the artifacts associated herewith. A limitation of both AFM and electron microscopy is, however, that specific cellular structures must be identified according to morphology unless some form of labeling can be applied. While antibodies conjugated to metal nanoparticles have been used with TEM in a few studies, no labeling techniques have been reported for SEM and AFM. It is, however, possible to combine AFM with optical microscopy and thus take advantage of the numerous options for fluorescent labeling of biomolecules. An important site of action is the cell membrane, and indeed, many essential oil constituents have been proposed to act on the bacterial membrane. Interaction of antimicrobial compounds with the membrane can affect the transport of nutrients and ions, the membrane potential, and the overall permeability of the cell. These effects are investigated by measuring the efflux of intracellular ions like K+ and H+. Efflux of small ions is not necessarily indicative of complete loss of membrane function, and can be observed in viable cells where growth is inhibited because the cell uses energy for repair or survival rather than cell proliferation. Effects on the cell membrane that lead to cell death is more accurately predicted by detecting the efflux of larger molecules like ATP or carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cFDA) after esterase reaction, or by influx of large polar organic DNA-binding stains like ethidium bromide and propidium iodide. It should be pointed out that it is always good practice to validate the observed effects by combining several techniques. Monitoring the release of calcein encapsulated in membrane vesicles can for example be used as a complimentary technique to confirm the membrane as the site of action. If no effects are observed on cell structure and membrane functionality, it is assumed that the site of action is intracellular. The target can be proteins and enzymes in general, or it can be essential cellular processes involved in biosynthesis or energy generation. An intracellular site of action can for example be determined by incorporation of radioactively labeled substrates used in particular biosynthesis pathways. Lack of or decreased incorporation is then taken as an indication of the process being affected by the antimicrobial compound. For example, radiolabeled nucleotides or amino acids can be used to detect if DNA replication or protein synthesis takes place, respectively. Some compounds have multiple sites of action, and in that case it can be difficult to pinpoint which one is ultimately responsible for cell death. For example, a compound that affects membrane permeability will also affect the membrane potential and thereby energy generation by respiration. It is thus difficult to distinguish direct effects on energy-generating processes from the indirect effect a permeable membrane has on these processes. At sublethal concentrations, changes to the transcriptome and proteome during exposure can reveal how the cell responds to the compound, and upregulation of genes involved in certain metabolic or biosynthesis pathways can be indicative of which cell structures or processes that are affected."
TA003702_M_0002,"The article further explores methods to elucidate the mode of action of antimicrobial compounds. Random transposon mutagenesis is used to identify mutations that compensate for antimicrobial effects, revealing specific interactions with enzymes or membrane components. Membrane fluidity and lipid packing are investigated using techniques like differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescence anisotropy measurements. Atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy is employed to visualize structural changes in membranes and quantify rigidity. Spectrofluorometry is used to study membrane properties with LAURDAN staining. These methods help in understanding how antimicrobial compounds interact with cellular membranes and intracellular targets.","The probably most comprehensive approach to investigate the mode of action of a particular compound is to perform random transposon mutagenesis in order to search for mutations that compensate for the antimicrobial effect of a particular compound. In this way, it is possible to identify the mode of action of compounds that interact very specifically with, e.g., a single enzyme or with particular proteins or lipids in the membrane. The approach is, however, not suited for investigating antimicrobial compounds that act simultaneously on several components in the cell, as a single mutation is unlikely to facilitate compensation for the antimicrobial effect on the cell as a whole. Antimicrobial compounds that act on the membrane can cause depolarization or increased permeability through various mechanisms. For example, some antimicrobial peptides form pores while other compounds, such as certain essential oil constituents, have a fluidifying effect on the membrane. Membrane properties like lipid packing can be investigated in membrane vesicles by LAURDAN staining combined with spectrofluorometry, and membrane fluidity can be investigated directly in bacteria by differential scanning calorimetry or fluorescence anisotropy measurements of DPH using a spectrofluorometer. AFM imaging has also in recent years allowed high-resolution visualization of native membranes on a solid support. Structural changes resulting from integration of an antimicrobial compound into the membrane can thus be visualized directly, and the effect on membrane rigidity can be quantified by AFM force spectroscopy. Functionalizing the AFM tip with the antimicrobial compound of interest furthermore allows investigation of interaction forces between the compound and its target. This approach was for example used to map binding events of vancomycin on the surface of bacteria and confirmed that binding occurred at the site of cell wall synthesis in dividing cells."
TA003702_M_0003,"The article details various techniques to study specific cellular processes affected by antimicrobial compounds. Spectrophotometric scanning is used to measure ergosterol content in yeast cells. Flow cytometry detects changes in membrane potential using fluorescent dyes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantifies toxin production. High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyze complex formation with thiol groups and identify protein changes. Liquid scintillation counting monitors radioactive substrate incorporation into DNA, RNA, and proteins. These methods provide insights into the disruption of cellular respiration, intracellular pH homeostasis, and enzyme inhibition by antimicrobial compounds.","Changes in yeast cell's ergosterol biosynthesis can be evaluated by comparing the intracellular content of ergosterols of cells grown in the absence or presence of antimicrobials. The content of ergosterols in an intracellular extract can be calculated using data obtained from a spectrophotometrically scan of the extract between 240 and 300 nm. Changes in concentration gradients of ions across a cell membrane can be detected either with a spectrofluorometer using bis-oxonol or DiSC3(5), or by flow cytometry using bis-oxonol, DiOC2(3), or BOX. 5-(and 6-)carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (cFDA-SE) is readily taken up by bacteria and hydrolyzed by esterases to 5-(and 6-)carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (cFSE). The intracellular pH can then be determined from the ratio of the fluorescent signal of cFSE at the pH-sensitive 490 nm and the pH-insensitive 440 nm. Intracellular pH is measured with pH-sensitive fluorescent probes pHluorin (cytoplasmic) and BCECF AM (vacuoles). Intracellular Ca2+ concentration is measured after transformation with a plasmid containing the gene for aequorin. Aequorin emits light upon binding Ca2+, and Ca2+ is thus quantified by measuring luminescence. Disruption of the cellular respiration can be detected by oxygen consumption measured with oxygen electrodes or by reduction of the stain 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC), which is reduced by the electron transport chain to the insoluble and fluorescent formazan. Reaction with thiol groups in a variety of targets can be monitored by complex formation with cysteine or glutathione as free SH-group compounds. Complex formation is then detected with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (LC–MS), or NMR. Competitive binding of thiol groups can also be tested by adding thiol-containing compounds, e.g., the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) or the organic compound desferal to the growth medium and test if the antimicrobial effect can be relieved. Inhibition of the cell wall synthesizing enzymes β-(1,3)-glucan synthase and chitin synthase have been monitored using the radioactive substrates UDP[14C]-Glu and UDP[U-14C]-GlcNAc by a liquid scintillation counter. Changes in enzyme activity of proteases, alcohol dehydrogenases, thioredoxin reductase, acetate kinase, decarboxylases, α-amylase, subtilisin, acetyl-CoA-forming enzyme systems, and ATPase has been investigated, using techniques such as spectrophotometer, luminometer, HPLC, pH monitoring, liquid scintillation counter, and zone of proteolysis. The effect on FtsZ assembly and hence on the cell division apparatus can be investigated using light scattering assay, GTP hydrolysis, TEM, isothermal titration calorimetry, saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy (STD NMR), and in silico molecular modeling. Random mutation can be used to identify the role of a particular genes in resistance or susceptibility mechanisms. Transcriptional up and down-regulation can subsequently be detected for genes of interest using RT-qPCR, or for a large number of genes simultaneously using microarrays. Changes in RNA, DNA, and protein biosynthesis can be detected by continuous incorporation of radioactive labeled uridine, thymidine, and leucine, respectively. Expression of specific proteins can be determined by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and western blotting followed by identification of peptide fragments by mass spectrometry. Changes in a proteome profile can be detected by 2D-PAGE electrophoresis separation followed by selection and excision of up or down-regulated protein-spots, which are then identified by mass spectrometry. The effect on excreted toxin production can be measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and spectrophotometric quantification."
TA003702_R_0001,"The study investigates the cytotoxic potential of essential oils from Eucalyptus benthamii and related terpenes (α-pinene, terpinen-4-ol, and γ-terpinene) on tumor cell lines (Jurkat, J774A.1, and HeLa). The essential oils showed stronger cytotoxic effects than individual terpenes, particularly against Jurkat and HeLa cells. Terpinen-4-ol exhibited similar cytotoxicity to the oils against Jurkat cells. The mechanism likely involves apoptosis, as indicated by LDH activity and reduced DNA content due to inhibited cell proliferation. The results confirm the antitumor potential of E. benthamii essential oils.","Title: In Vitro Cytotoxic Potential of Essential Oils of Eucalyptus benthamii and Its Related Terpenes on Tumor Cell Lines. Abstract: Eucalyptus L. is traditionally used for many medicinal purposes. In particular, some Eucalyptus species have currently shown cytotoxic properties. Local Brazilian communities have used leaves of E. benthamii as a herbal remedy for various diseases, including cancer. Considering the lack of available data for supporting this cytotoxic effect, the goal of this paper was to study the in vitro cytotoxic potential of the essential oils from young and adult leaves of E. benthamii and some related terpenes (α-pinene, terpinen-4-ol, and γ-terpinene) on Jurkat, J774A.1 and HeLa cells lines. Regarding the cytotoxic activity based on MTT assay, the essential oils showed improved results than α-pinene and γ-terpinene, particularly for Jurkat and HeLa cell lines. Terpinen-4-ol revealed a cytotoxic effect against Jurkat cells similar to that observed for volatile oils. The results of LDH activity indicated that cytotoxic activity of samples against Jurkat cells probably involved cell death by apoptosis. The decrease of cell DNA content was demonstrated due to inhibition of Jurkat cells proliferation by samples as a result of cytotoxicity. In general, the essential oils from young and adult leaves of E. benthamii presented cytotoxicity against the investigated tumor cell lines which confirms their antitumor potential."
TA003702_R_0002,"The study evaluates the fumigant toxicity of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil against Sitophilus zeamais adults, showing dose- and time-dependent mortality. The highest dose (11.97 mg/L air) caused 82.22–92.04% mortality over 72 hours, with LC50 values decreasing over time. Terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol were the most potent constituents. The oil also significantly inhibited AChE, GST, and CarE enzymes in S. zeamais, with effects peaking at 12–24 hours before partial recovery. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 3,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), mostly up-regulated, linked to metabolic and respiratory pathways, suggesting disrupted respiration and xenobiotic metabolism. qRT-PCR validated the RNA-Seq data, confirming the reliability of the findings.","Result: To investigate the toxicity of M. alternifolia essential oil against adults of S. zeamais, we performed the fumigation assay. We found that the fumigant effect of M. alternifolia essential oil increased with the increasing dose at each 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after oil treatment (Table 1). At the same dose, gradually increased effect of fumigation was observed over the time course of 24-48-72 h. The largest dose of 11.97 mg/L air of essential oils caused the mortality of 82.22, 85.56, and 92.04% in S. zeamais after 24, 48, and 72 h of oil treatment, respectively. The corresponding median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.42, 7.70, and 6.78 mg/L air, respectively. We also tested the toxicity of each of five major constituents of essential oil against S. zeamais. Both terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol chemotypes showed the most potent activities with a LC50 value of 3.12 and 5.87 mg/L air, respectively (Table 2). These results provide evidence that M. alternifolia essential oil has the fumigant toxicity against adults of S. zeamais. The inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on three enzymes, AChE, GST, and CarE of S. zeamais was determined. All three enzymes were significantly inhibited in vivo (Scheffe’s test with a p value < 0.05) (Fig 1). The essential oil of M. alternifolia showed a moderate enzyme inhibition at the dose of 5.39 mg/L air. The activities of AChE, GST, and CarE in S. zeamais after treatment from 12 to 24 h were significantly inhibited. However, they were restored to certain amounts after 24 h. Overall, a pattern of significant dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of M. alternifolia essential oil on the enzyme activity in S. zeamais was observed. To explore the gene expression profiles of S. zeamais in response to essential oil treatment, RNA-Seq was carried out. A total of 44, 697, 706 and 44, 884, 212 clean reads were obtained from 47, 508, 238 and 47, 506, 862 raw reads of non-oil and oil-fumigated samples (Table 3), respectively. According to stringent quality assessment and data filtering, 33,483 unigenes were de novo assembled using the Trinity software with default parameters, a N50 length of 1,621 bp and a mean length of 944 bp (Table 3). After de novo assembly, a total of 20, 811 (62.15%) unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the seven databases, including the Non-redundant (Nr), Nucleotide (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Swiss-Prot, Interpro, and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. About 19, 741 (58.96%) unigenes had the best hit in the Nr database (Table 4). Among them, the homologous genes showing the best match (54.24%) were from Dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by Tribolium castaneum (26.73%) (Fig 2A). Based on GO annotations, only 4, 282 (12.79%) unigenes were classified into different functional terms (Fig 2B). In addition, a total of 15, 074 (45.02%) unigenes were analyzed using the KEGG annotation system with default parameters to predict the metabolic pathways. They were divided into 42 subcategories and 295 KEGG pathways (Fig 2C). A total of 3, 562 differentially expressed unigenes were identified (S2 Table), including 2,836 up-regulated and 726 down-regulated genes after a comparative analysis between oil-fumigated and control samples. To annotate these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both GO and KEGG functional analyses were performed. A total of 600 DEGs, including 504 up-regulated and 96 down-regulated (Fig 3A and S3 Table) with GO annotations were classified into the category of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes, respectively. When comparing the unigenes with the entire p < 0.01, the DEGs were enriched in the following categories: nucleotide phosphate binding (161 unigenes), nucleotide binding (161 unigenes), and catabolic process (18 unigenes). To obtain more information to predict the function of DEGs, the DEGs were mapped in the KEGG database. The pathway functional enrichment was analyzed using hypergeometric test with FDR adjusted p values ≤ 0.01. Overall, a total of 1,578 DEGs were assigned to 295 different pathways (S4 Table) and the pathways were classified into six categories (Fig 3B). According to the threshold of Q values < 0.05, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 11 pathways were significantly enriched (Table 5). Among these 11 KEGG pathways, it is worth noting that some were associated with the respiration-related response, including cytochrome P450s, pentoses, and glucuronates, as well as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway. However, an abundance of DEGs were mapped into the metabolism pathway that were associated with respiration and metabolism of xenobiotics, suggesting that abnormal respiration and metabolic disorders occurred in adult S. zeamais following fumigation with M. alternifolia essential oil. To verify the reliability of RNA-Seq data, fifteen DEGs involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, including GSTs, CarEs, and ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) (S1 Table) were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. Similar trends of up/down-regulation of selected DEGs between qRT-PCR and transcriptome data were observed (Fig 4), indicating that RNA-Seq data was reliable."
