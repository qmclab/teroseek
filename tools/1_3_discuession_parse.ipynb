       "'\\nThe topic is Selected cannabis terpenes synergize with THC to enhance CB1 receptor activation.\\n=================\\nDiscuession:[\\'**4. discussion** The current study evaluated the role of terpenes in CB1 receptor -mediated functions, studying terpenes as direct agonists of CB1 receptors and as modulators of THC agonism. The results are discussed in view of methodological considerations and in comparison to prior reports, elaborating on plausible mechanisms of action and important therapeutic implications. Selection of the compositions to be tested. In order to optimally evaluate the role of terpenes on CB1 receptor and their modulation of THC-derived CB1 receptor activation, it is important to properly select (1) a representative set of diverse cannabis terpene; (2) a terpene to cannabinoid ratio representative of the natural cannabis plants, being in the order of 1/10 weight/ weight; and (3) concentrations within the solubility limits of the various reagents. The selections made here differ, at least partially, from those of prior studies, which may explain differences in findings. Terpenes tested: Dozens of terpenes are found in the cannabis plant, the composition and content of which vary quite notably among different cannabis chemovars. In order to obtain more conclusive findings, the current study tested the effects of sixteen cannabis terpenes, including both major and minor terpenes. Previous studies [\\\\\\\\[28,29,31\\\\\\\\]](#page-13-0)  have tested only subsets of these terpene. Terpene to cannabinoid ratios: Commonly marketed cannabis inflorescences generally contain about 5–25% THC. Total terpene concentrations in cannabis inflorescences were typically in the 1% range, however, due to selective breeding, this concentration was raised to about 3% in some inflorescences [\\\\\\\\[39,40\\\\\\\\],](#page-14-0) reaching terpene to <span id=\"page-10-0\"></span>![](_page_10_Figure_1.jpeg) *Biochemical Pharmacology 212 (2023) 115548* **Fig. 10.** Summation and synergistic modulatory effects of different terpenes. **A-H**. The blue symbols and lines are theoretical DR curves obtained by calculating the sum of (i) DR curves that describe the CB1 receptor activation by THC alone ([Fig. 1](#page-2-0)) and (ii) the DR curves that describe the CB1 receptor activation by terpenes alone ([Fig. 4](#page-4-0)). DR curves of the data presented in [Fig. 8](#page-8-0), obtained by co-application of THC and a terpene (red symbols and lines) are shown for comparison. \\\\\\\\*, p *<* 0.05; \\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\*, p *<* 0.01; \\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\*; p *<* 0.001 (see [Table 6](#page-12-0) in for statistical data). cannabinoid weight/weight ratios of up to about 1:10. Prior studies assessing modulation of THC activity at CB1 receptors by terpenes [\\\\\\\\[28,29,31\\\\\\\\]](#page-13-0) have used terpene to THC ratios of 1:1 or higher, failing to represent the terpene to cannabinoid ratios which occur naturally in the cannabis plant. Concentrations of reagents: The solubility in water of THC and of many of the terpenes tested (as well as in aqueous solutions containing salts – \"physiological solutions\") is low, a few milligrams per liter or less ([Table 2\\\\\\\\)](#page-1-0). In-vitro tests referred to herein [\\\\\\\\[28,29,31\\\\\\\\]](#page-13-0), have used concentrations of reagents of up to 1 mM. Specifically, while the concentrations of cannabinoids tested were within the solubility limit, those of the terpenes used were frequently outside this limit. This may question the conclusions derived from such studies. LaVigne et al. [\\\\\\\\[31\\\\\\\\]](#page-13-0) for example, have presented dose responses at 5 µM to 1 mM for activation of CB1 receptors by linalool, geraniol, β-pinene, humulene and β-caryophyllene. However, β-pinene is soluble at up to about 50 µM while the solubility of humulene and β-caryophyllene is under 5 µM. Thus, the resulting dose–response curves seem to extend beyond real solubility.
