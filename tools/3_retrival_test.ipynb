       "'[\"ref_1:Enzymes make life possible by catalyzing chemical reactions in organisms with remarkable rate enhancement and specificity.[1–3] The ability to catalyze reactions with such astounding efficiency is attributed to their ability to bind the transition state of the rate-limiting chemical step more tightly than the reactant state, and this may be ascribed to active site preorganization.[3] In addition to reducing the free energy barrier of the rate-limiting step, enzymes have evolved to perform complex types of chemistry, such as reactions involving multistep cascades, and to specifically recognize reaction substrates and intermediates to avoid byproducts.[4] Enzymes forming natural products are ubiquitous in plant and microbial metabolism and can generate extremely complex molecules with high stereochemical content, complex bonding networks, and multiple heteroatoms.[5,6] This structural and functional group complexity is achieved by efficient enzymatic routes that convert acyclic compounds into cyclic scaffolds, which is often followed by functionalization.[7] For example, terpene synthases (TPSs) generate some of nature\\'s most complex natural compounds, while subsequent functionalizing enzymes, such as P450 monooxygenases, acyltransferases, and glycosyltransferases, generate functionalized terpenes, that is, terpenoids.[8,9] Many terpenes are used as pharmaceuticals, cosmetic products, biofuels, and serve as the building blocks for secondary metabolites such as steroids or essential oils.[6,10] The synthesis of common small to medium sized terpenes commences with the binding of one of the substrates geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphates (GGPP). GPP, FPP, and GGPP form monoterpenes (C10),[11] sesquiterpenes (C15),[12] and diterpenes (C20),[13] respectively (Figure 1A). In general, the biosynthesis of terpenes can occur via two pathways that differ in the activation of the substrate.[11,12] In class I TPSs, the substrate undergoes a heterolytic C O bond cleavage with the help of three divalent (e.g., Mg2+) ions (Figure 1). The pyrophosphate group remains bound in a highly polar active pocket region, while the hydrocarbon tail forms geranyl, farnesyl, or geranylgeranyl allyl cations, respectively, which are stabilized in a hydrophobic region of the active site pocket (Figure 1C) and react further in a series of carbocation rearrangement steps until final quenching and formation of the product. Due to the high reactivity of the carbocation intermediates the main role of TPS enzymes is arguably not to lower the free energy barriers, but instead to stabilize intermediates and guide the reaction to form specific products with varying degrees of specificity.[9,10,14–21] In type II TPSs, the reaction is initiated by active site protonation of a substrate C=C bond, and the isoprenoid moiety remains bound to the pyrophosphate group throughout the reaction.A better understanding of the function of TPS can be gained by solving the crystal structure of these enzymes in their holo-state.[10] Usually, these structures do not contain the natural ligand (e.g., GPP, FPP or GGPP), and hence, crucial questions regarding the initial binding and cyclization remain. A key question is how do different class I TPS enzymes recognize isoprenoid diphosphates and correctly fold them inside the active site, and more specifically, which of the two oxygen atoms of the pyrophosphate facing the hydrophobic pocket binds to the aliphatic chain (Figure 2)? In this work, we address this question by a combined approach of structural biology analysis, bioinformatics, and using the multiscale multistate docking program EnzyDock.[22]\", \"ref_2:Terpenoids now span more than 90,000 known compounds, which makes them by far the largest class of natural products [1]. Despite this fact, all compounds are made from only two C5 building blocks, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), that can be fused by oligoprenyl diphosphate synthases to yield geranyl diphosphate (GPP, C10) as the precursor to monoterpenes, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP, C15) as sesquiterpene precursor, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP, C20) towards diterpenes, and geranylfarnesyl diphosphate (GFPP, C25) for sesterterpene biosynthesis. Type I terpene synthases (TPSs) activate these acyclic molecules by the abstraction of diphosphate to produce a reactive allyl cation that can initiate a cascade reaction through typical carbocation chemistry, including cyclisation reactions by intramolecular attack of an olefinic double bond to the cationic centre Wagner–Meerwein rearrangements, and proton or hydride migrations [2]. These multistep cascade reactions ultimately result in terpene hydrocarbons that are often (poly)cyclic and contain several stereogenic centres [3,4]. In some cases, water is incorporated by its nucleophilic attack at a cationic intermediate, leading to terpene alcohols [5,6] or sometimes ethers [7,8]. Substrate ionisation by TPSs is achieved through binding of the diphosphate portion to a trinuclear Mg2+ cluster in the active site that is itself bound to two highly conserved motifs (Supporting Information File 1, Figure S1), composed in bacterial and non-plant eukaryotic enzymes of the aspartate-rich motif DDXX(X)D around position 90 and the NSE triad ND(L,I,V)XSXX(K,R)E near position 230 (Figure 1) [9].While the amino acid sequences of two TPSs can strongly deviate, their overall structures are very similar and constitute an α-helical fold that was first described for the FPP synthase (FPPS) from chicken (Gallus gallus) [10]. A helix G break first observed in tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase with a nearby main chain carbonyl group stabilises the allyl cation of the ionised substrate [9]. The structure of bacterial selina-4(15),7(11)-diene synthase (SdS) and its comparison to other TPS structures revealed that this helix break motif is a general feature of type I TPSs [11]. Furthermore, hydrogen bondings of the substrate\\'s diphosphate to a highly conserved Arg residue (pyrophosphate sensor, located usually 46 residues upstream of the NSE triad, Figure 1) can be observed. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this residue is important for SdS catalysis [11]. Additional conserved residues include a Pro at the bottom of helix C causing a helix turn (21 positions upstream of the DDXX(X)D motif), a Leu (Val, Ile) at the start of helix D that with its steric bulk maintains a distance between helices D and G (14 positions upstream of the DDXX(X)D motif) [12-14], a pair of an Arg and a Glu (Asp) residue (34 positions upstream and 14 positions downstream of the pyrophosphate sensor) that form a salt bridge between helices F and G [12-14], and a conserved Asn (8 or 9 residues downstream of the NSE triad) that hydrogen bridges to the Mg2+ binding Glu of the NSE triad [15]. In between these structural anchors the amino acid sequences of terpene synthases seem to be quite random, only the active site is lined with mostly non-polar residues. They contour the active site and force the substrate into a certain conformation which, after substrate ionisation, determines the reaction pathway that is taken by the cationic cascade. Here we present site-directed mutagenesis experiments with the sestermobaraene synthase SmTS1 [16] that target the positions usually taken by the described structural anchors and active site contouring residues.\", \\'ref_3:Continuing our X-ray diffraction studies applied to establish the structural details of natural products, in this paper, we report the results of intra- and intermolecular geometry investigations of isomers 30-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-3-one (1) and (11α)-11-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-3-one (2), emphasizing the effects of hydrogen bonds on molecular conformations.results and discussion Crystal structure of 30-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-3-one (1). Pentacyclic triterpene 1 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric P1 space group. Based on the analysis of the crystal structure of 1, it was possible to establish two molecules in the asymmetric unit (hereafter called 1A and 1B). Fig. 1 is an Ortep-3 [24] type displaying the structure of 1A with non-hydrogenous atoms labelled. During the structure determination disordered sites around the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of 1B were found (Fig. 2). Trial refinements were used with the split-atom approach for these extra sites. From a statistical and convergence point of view, the classical split-atom model with two carbonylic oxygen atoms and three hydroxyl groups resulted in the best structural refinement. The model splitting each oxygen atom of the carbonyl group over two positions, O21 and O22, with a constrained 50% occupancy each, was found to be the best one. For the three disordered sites found to the hydroxyl group, labelled as O41, O42, and O43, the SHELXL [20] restraints were applied, enabling one atom to be distributed over more than two sites so that the elemental composition corresponded (within suitable standard deviations) to an experimental chemical analysis. This means that the sum of site occupation factors was restrained to be equal to one oxygen atom. The refined occupation values found for O41, O42, and O43 sites were 0.368(3), 0.341(4), and 0.291(4) respectively. Except the aforementioned disorder, the intramolecular geometry of 1A and 1B is similar. A comparison of 1A and 1B through the method of Kabsch [27] (disordered atoms were not considered) showed them to be similar with a root mean square deviation between homologous atoms of 0.10(7) Å. In both structures, the ring A adopts a half-boat conformation, whereas the rings B, C, and D adopt a chair conformation. The remaining ring E presents an envelope shape with the quaternary carbon at the ring-corner in the flap position. The intramolecular conformation of 1A and 1B was analyzed using MOGUL [25], which confirmed that all bond lengths and bond angles agree with the expected values reported in the literature. According to the Mogul analysis [25], there are small variations among the C–C single bond lengths (average value of 1.52(3) Å). The C2–C3 (1.508(4) Å) and C3–C4 (1.521(3) Å) single bond lengths, which contain the C3 atom belonging to a carbonyl group, are shorter than the remaining C–C bond lengths, such as C13–C14 (1.562(3) Å) and C8–C14 (1.598(3) Å) bond lengths, in which carbon atoms are completely substituted. In the first case, electronegative oxygen removes the electronic density from C3 resulting in a stronger interaction with either the C2 or C4 atoms, shortening the bond lengths. In the second case, the neighboring atoms are electron density donors, making them slightly longer. In addition, steric hindrance occurs around the most substituted carbon atoms. Concerning the bond lengths of the C30–O2 hydroxyl group with 1.420(3) Å and the C3=O1 carbonyl group with 1.221(3) Å, these values represent an evidence of single (average value of 1.41(3) Å) and double (average value of 1.22(2) Å) bonds respectively, when looking at the similar entries returned by the Mogul search [25]. In the structure, C20 and C29 atoms are separated by 1.328(4) Å, as expected based on sp2 hybridization. Except the C3 atom, all other carbon atoms in the six- and five-membered rings adopt sp3 hybridization. Some angle bonds slightly deviate from the ideal geometry, which can be explained by ring tensions. In the six-membered rings, the distortions on angle bonds are minimized by the chair conformation, whereas the five-membered rings are more tensioned, explaining the angular range observed from 100.1(2)° to 106.3(2)°. The molecular assembly of 1 is stabilized by four independent hydrogen bonds that give rise to an infinite double chain parallel to the [1 10] direction (Fig. 2; Table 2). In crystal packing, the 1A molecules are linked in a tail-head fashion by carbonyl at C3 and the hydroxyl group at C30 (Fig. 1). The 1B molecules are linked along the [1 10] direction in the same fashion. However, either the hydroxyl or carbonyl group is split in two positions: the O41 atom is a hydrogen bond donor to O31, whereas the O42 one is a hydrogen bond donor to O32. The two single chains are also linked together by a fourth hydrogen bond, in which O43 acts as an intermolecular hydrogen bond donor to the O1 atom in 1A. Therefore, the presence of the disordered sites in 1A can be explained as a result of the supramolecular requirements in order to stabilize the packing of molecules in the solid state (Fig. 2). Finally, the conformational comparison between 1 and 3 [10] carried out by the Kabsch method [27] revealed great similarity between both structures. A difference was observed in the A ring conformation, the substituent functional group at C3 (C–O is longer than C=O), and also in the torsional angle of the hydroxyl linked at C30. The root mean square deviation between the homologous atoms is 0.58(31) Å. On the other hand, their intermolecular structures are completely different. As discussed above, the packing of 1 is formed by double chains along the [1 10] direction, which are linked by van der Waals forces. As showed previously [10, 11], the crystal packing of 3 and lupeol is stabilized by intermolecular interactions forming infinite helical chains along the c axis. Since the molecular assembly depends on the intermolecular bonding motifs, the differences observed in the supramolecular chemistry of compounds 1, 3 and lupeol can be explained by the absence of a strong proton donor linked at the C3 atom in 1. On the other hand, either 3 or lupeol present a hydroxyl group linked at the C3 atom that is involved in hydrogen bonding acting as a donor and acceptor.\\', \\'ref_4:Despite the relevance of terpenes in citrus, their biosynthesis has remained elusive until recently. Terpene biosynthesis starts with one isoprene unit, C5 isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), through serial additions of this unit to reach the formation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranyl geranyl diphosphate (GGPP) via elongation reactions. In plants, monoterpenes (C10-based) are synthesized from the plastid-derived GPP, and sesquiterpenes (C15-based) from the cytoplasmically derived FPP. The conversions of these precursors are carried out by a large family of enzymes known as TPSs, to produce a vast array of terpenoids. According to their genomic structure, including intron number, exon size, and intron position, TPSs can be classified into three classes: 12–14 introns (class I), 9 introns (class II), or 6 introns (class III). In general, TPS proteins are 550–850 amino acids length and their molecular masses are about 50–100 kDa. Monoterpene synthases (MonoTPSs) are in the range of 600–650 amino acids and bear an N-terminal transit plastid, in accordance with monoterpene biosynthesis in plastids. As sesquiterpene biosynthesis takes place in the cytosol, sesquiterpene synthases (SesquiTPSs) lack plastid targeting signals, and they are typically about 50–70 amino acids shorter than MonoTPSs. Although a high number of TPS are supposed to be present in the citrus genome, just a few have been cloned from citrus. From the peel of lemon fruits, isolated two D-limonene synthases, which also produced minute amounts of β-myrcene and α-pinene, and two other enzymes less specific in their product formation, which generate a major product (γ-terpinene or β-pinene) and up to 11% of other monoterpenes. A γ-terpinene synthase and a sabinene synthase producing other side compounds were isolated from Satsuma mandarin [Citrus unshiu (Mak.) Marc.] and rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri Lush.), respectively. Also from Satsuma mandarin, different D-limonene and linalool synthases were characterized. A single-product valencene synthase was isolated from Valencia sweet orange. Isolated a TPS producing δ-elemene or β-myrcene when FPP or GPP were used as substrates, respectively, indicating that the TPS activity of this enzyme is strictly determined by subcellular localization. Similarly, CuSTS4 produced linalool or nerolidol depending on the substrate provided. Thus, in general, the product(s) of a given TPS cannot be predicted from an analysis of its homology with identified TPS sequences, and it has been suggested that the product specificity of Mono/SesquiTPS depends on a critical region rather than the entire structure. For example, β-pinene synthases of lemon, and Satsuma mandarin have 95 and 97% sequence identity, respectively, with the sabinene synthase isolated from rough lemon, though the last, because of a single amino acid substitution, could not produce β-pinene dominantly. Considering the importance of terpenes in citrus and the limited amount of knowledge that is currently available about their biosynthesis, the objective of this work was to characterize the TPS family in citrus, taking advantage of the enormous amount of information available as a result of the citrus genomes sequence projects. Special interest has been devoted to the characterization of SesquiTPS, because only four enzymes have been characterized so far from citrus with this type of activity.The search for templates in PDB proteins database revealed (+) δ-cadinene synthase from Gossypum arboreum (Protein bank code 3G4D_A; [Gennadios et al., 2009]) as the best match to model Cs4g12400, orange1.1t04360, and Cs4g11980 (confidence 100%; match >50%; coverage 0.99). 3D-protein structural models were obtained with the SWISS-MODEL server in Autoated Mode [Biasini et al., 2014]. Structural figures were drawn using PyMol.\\', \\'ref_5:**1. introduction** Terpenoids constitute a vast group of natural compounds, with over 50,000 distinct types identified across a broad spectrum of organisms including plants, bacteria, and invertebrates [\\\\\\\\[1](#page-17-0)[–3\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-1). These compounds are primarily composed of concatenated C<sup>5</sup> isoprenoid units, with structural variations such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), and diterpenes (C20) defined by the number of these isoprenoid blocks [\\\\\\\\[3,](#page-17-1)[4\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-2). The biosynthesis of terpenoids is facilitated through two principal pathways: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the methyl-erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, both of which produce the universal precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) [\\\\\\\\[5\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-3). In plants, a large family of structurally related enzymes known as terpene synthases/cyclases (TPSs) orchestrates terpenoid biosynthesis. Typically, TPSs in plastids catalyze the cyclization of substrates such as geranyl/neryl diphosphate (GPP/NPP, C10; neryl being the cis-isomer of geranyl) to yield monoterpenes, or convert geranylgeranyl/nerylneryl diphosphate (GGPP/NNPP, C20) into diterpenes. Conversely, cytosolic TPSs primarily catalyze the transformation of trans/cis-farnesyl diphosphate (*E*, *E*-FPP/*Z*, *Z*-FPP, C15) into sesquiterpenes [\\\\\\\\[6](#page-17-4)[–8\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-5). However, the specific localization of terpene biosynthesis can vary, with instances of monoterpenes and diterpenes also being synthesized in the cytosol, and sesquiterpenes in the plastids [\\\\\\\\[9–](#page-17-6)[11\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-7). Given the crucial role of terpenes in plant biology, research into TPSs has been extensive. The protein sequence of TPS is characterized by two domains: the N-terminal domain (Pfam ID PF01397) includes the \\\\\\'RRX8W\\\\\\' (R, arginine; W, tryptophan; X, alternative amino acid) motif, and the C-terminal domain (Pfam ID PF03936) provides binding sites for Mg2+ and Mn2+ [\\\\\\\\[4](#page-17-2)[,12\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-8). The C-terminal domain is further divided into α, β, and γ domains. The α domain is a highly α-helical \"isoprenoid\" or farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS or FPPase) fold, with catalysis mediated via \\\\\\'DDxxD\\\\\\' motifs using a Mg2+-dependent \"ionization-initiated\" mechanism [\\\\\\\\[13\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-9). The β and γ domains are located between a pair of α-helical double-barrel domains and carry out a \"protonation-initiated\" mechanism utilizing a catalytic \\\\\\'DxDD\\\\\\' motif [\\\\\\\\[8\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-5). The taxonomy, distribution, and products of TPSs in plants have been well studied (Table [1\\\\\\\\)](#page-1-0) [\\\\\\\\[12](#page-17-8)[–18\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-10).**Subgroup Classification Domain Composition Motif Features Distribution Subcellular Localization Type of Products** TPS-a Class I βα With \\\\\\'RRX8W\\\\\\' motif (the second \\\\\\'R\\\\\\' is not conserved) Angiosperms M/P/C Sesqui-TPSs TPS-b Class I βα With conserved \\\\\\'RRX8W\\\\\\' motif Angiosperms P/C Mono-TPSs, Isoprene synthase TPS-g Class I βα Without \\\\\\'RRX8W\\\\\\' motif Angiosperms P/C Acyclic mono-, Sesqui- and Di-TPSs TPS-h Class I/II γβα Contain both \\\\\\'DxDD\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'DDxxD\\\\\\' motifs Mosses, Liverworts, Lycophytes and Ferns unknown Di-TPSs TPS-e/f Class I γβα/βα Without \\\\\\'DxDD\\\\\\' motif Vascular plants M/P/C Ent-kaurene synthase (KS); Mono-, Sesqui-, and Di-TPSs TPS-c Class II γβα/βα With conserved \\\\\\'DxDD\\\\\\' motif Land plants M/P Copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), CPS/KS; Mono-, Sesqui-, and Di-TPSs TPS-d Class I/II βα/γβα Contain both \\\\\\'DxDD\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'DDxxD\\\\\\' motifs Gymnosperms unknown Mono-, Sesquiand Di-TPSs <span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>**Table 1.** Taxonomy of plant TPS subgroups. Abbreviation: Di-, diterpene; Mono-, monoterpene; Sesqui-, sesquiterpene; C, cytosolic; P, plastidic; M, mitochondrial. The TPS family is mid-sized and highly diversified in plants. The ancestral TPS was likely a bifunctional Class I and II diterpene synthase producing the ent-kaurene required for phytohormone production [\\\\\\\\[19\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-11). The ancestral TPS genes underwent gene duplication at least twice, leading to three ancient TPS lineages: TPS-c, TPS-e/f, and the remaining TPS (h/d/a/b/g) subfamilies (also called subgroups) [\\\\\\\\[8\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-5). TPS-a is the largest subgroup and expanded after the split of the monocot and dicot lineages [\\\\\\\\[20\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-12). The TPS-c subfamily enzymes CPS (copalyl diphosphate synthase) and KS (ent-kaurene synthase) catalyze the committed steps in gibberellin biosynthesis, which governs stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering time across land plants [\\\\\\\\[19\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-11). The evolutionary characteristics of the other subgroups in complex angiosperms have not yet been fully elucidated. TPS families have been extensively studied in diverse plant species, including *Arabidopsis thaliana* (L.) Heynh. [\\\\\\\\[21\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-13), tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum* L.) [\\\\\\\\[8](#page-17-5)[,16\\\\\\\\]](#page-17-14), grapevine (*Vitis vinifera* L.) [\\\\\\\\[22\\\\\\\\]](#page-18-0), *Eucalyptus grandis* W. Hill [\\\\\\\\[23\\\\\\\\]](#page-18-1), apple (*Malus domestica* Borkh.) [\\\\\\\\[24\\\\\\\\]](#page-18-2), *Mentha longifolia* (L.) Huds. [\\\\\\\\[25\\\\\\\\]](#page-18-3), common wheat (*Triticum aestivum* L.) [\\\\\\\\[26\\\\\\\\]](#page-18-4), and Orchidaceae [\\\\\\\\[27\\\\\\\\]](#page-18-5), etc. Both transcriptome-based analysis and the isolation of individual genes have contributed to the identification of increasing numbers of plant *TPS* genes [\\\\\\\\[28](#page-18-6)[,29\\\\\\\\]](#page-18-7). The increasing availability of high-quality genomic resources means that it should now be possible to comprehensively analyze the evolution and functional diversification of *TPSs*. We reasoned that building networks of the phylogenetic and syntenic relationships of *TPSs* across numerous species could provide insights into the evolution of these important genes, which exhibit variation and conservation in both gene sequence and biochemical function.After domain verification, the 3802 TPS protein sequences were classified into six TPS subgroups. Based on the method of, TPS-e and TPS-f were combined into one subgroup: TPS-e/f. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment was performed using ClustalX (version 2.0) with standard parameters. The results were analyzed using the online program MEME, and the alignments were manually adjusted to classify the conserved motifs of TPSs, such as \\\\\\'RRX8W\\\\\\', \\\\\\'DDxxD\\\\\\', \\\\\\'DxDD\\\\\\', and \\\\\\'NSE/DTE\\\\\\'. The multiple sequence alignment results were saved in fasta format. A phylogenetic tree of the chosen TPS protein sequences was constructed using RAxML with the maximum-likelihood method based on the best substitution model Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT), with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The phylogenetic tree was visualized using the Figtree program (version 1.4.4) and iTOL online software (version 5). Information about chromosomal locations and gene structures was obtained from the gff3 file in the *R. chinensis* genome database (RchiOBHm-V2) and is provided in Table S7. Mapchart was used to visualize the chromosomal locations of all putative functional terpene synthases in *R. chinensis.* The online software GSDS was used to depict the introns and exons in the 54 *RcTPS* genes. Two RNA-seq data sets were used to obtain rose TPS gene expression data by the TPM method (transcripts per kilobase million). One data set includes transcriptome data from rose petals at different stages of development (BioProject PRJNA351281, Table S8, Q30 ≥ 92%, mapping rate ≥ 85%, Error rate ≤ 0.02), and the other contains transcriptome data from different rose tissues (root, stem, leaf, prickle, stamen, pistil, and ovary tissue) (BioProject PRJNA546486, Table S9, Q30 ≥ 93%, mapping rate ≥ 90%, Error rate ≤ 0.03). Heat maps representing gene expression levels were drawn with the R package pheatmap (version 1.0.12). Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the gene expression levels of *RcTPS23* in eight tissues of *R. chinensis* \\\\\\'Old Blush\\\\\\' (petals at four stages: FB\\\\\\\\_GP, FB\\\\\\\\_CP, FB\\\\\\\\_PP, OF\\\\\\\\_PP, stamen, leaf, stem, and root tissues). A Plant RNA Isolation Kit was used to extract total RNA from each sample. A PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA from 1.0 µg total RNA. The reaction mixture contained 10 µL SYBR Premix Ex Taq, 0.4 µL 10 µM forward and reverse transcript-specific primers, 2 µL cDNA, and 7.2 µL sterile distilled water. The qRT-PCR was performed using a CFX96™ Real-Time PCR system with the following program: 95 ◦C for 30 s; 40 cycles of 95 ◦C for 5 s and 60 ◦C for 30 s; and a final melting curve analysis of 95 ◦C for 15 s, 60 ◦C for 1 min, and 95 ◦C for 15 s. The relative gene expression levels were normalized against the expression level of the endogenous reference gene *RcActin* and calculated using the 2−∆∆Ct method. Each sample was examined with three biological replicates. The histograms were generated using the Origin9 program (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA). The cDNA sequence of *RcTPS23* was amplified using the forward primer 5′ - GGTACCATGACGTTCATTCTTCAAGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′ -CTCGAGGCTAGCC ATGAGTGATGC-3′ under the following conditions: 94 ◦C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 ◦C for 10 s, 54 ◦C for 15 s, and 72 ◦C for 2 min, with a final extension of 72 ◦C for 5 min, using KOD-Plus-Neo DNA Polymerase. The PCR product was cloned into the pEZS-NL vector, which had been cleaved with KpnI/XhoI. *A. thaliana* protoplast isolation and transformation were carried out according to a standard protocol. Using empty vector-transfected protoplasts as the control. The transformed protoplasts were incubated at 23 ◦C for 16 h and observed under a laser confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8, Wetzlar, Germany) to detect eGFP fluorescence; eGFP was excited at 488 nm. The cDNA sequence of *RcTPS23* was cloned into the *pET-32a* vector by In-Fusion cloning using the forward primer 5′ -GGCTGATATCGGATCCATGACGTTCATTCTTCAAGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′ -CAAGCTTGTCGACGGAGCTCGCTAGCCATGAGTGATGC-3′ and transformed into *E. coli* strain BL21 (DE3). Recombinant protein production was induced by adding 0.8 mM isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubating at 16 ◦C for 24 h. The *E. coli* cells were sonicated and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant, and proteins were purification on a Ni Sepharose column. The purified proteins were collected and concentrated. In vitro enzyme activity assays of RcTPS23 recombinant protein were carried out using 50 µg purified protein in 200 µL of assay buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 5% (*v*/*v*) glycerol, 50 µM FPP or 50 µM GPP]. The blank control contained the same buffer and substrates but no recombinant protein. The samples were incubated at 30 ◦C for 2 h, and the volatile products were absorbed on 100 µm PDMS fiber prior to GC-MS analysis. The PDMS fiber was transferred to the injection port (250 ◦C) of the GC-MS system and desorbed for 5 min. GC was performed using a GC system coupled with a mass spectrometer. For GC, an HB-5MS column (5% phenyl methyl silox: 30 m × 250 µm i.d., 0.25 µm) was used for all samples. The analytical conditions were as follows: The initial temperature was held at 50 ◦C for 1 min and raised to 210 ◦C for 2 min at 3 ◦C/min, maintained for 3 min, and increased to 230 ◦C at 15 ◦C/min. The analysis was conducted in split-less mode; helium was used as the carrier gas at a rate of 1.0 mL/min. The mass spectrometer was set as follows: 230 ◦C, electron-impact (EI) model with 70 eV electron power; 280 ◦C for the auxiliary temperature. The scan range was 80–500 *m*/*z*. The volatile products were identified and characterized by comparing mass spectra using AMDIS software and the NIST Mass Spectral Library. The assay conditions were established based on previously validated methods for terpene synthase characterization.\\', \\'ref_6:Terpenes (also known as terpenoids or isoprenoids) are one of the largest group of plant metabolites, with more than 30,000 different structures (Kong et al. [2011]), spread over the widest assortment of structural types with hundreds of different monoterpene, sesquiterpene, diterpene, and triterpene carbon skeletons (Degenhardt et al. [2009]). The majority of terpenes have been isolated from plants, where their enormous structural variability leads to a great functional diversity. Terpenes play important roles in almost all basic plant processes, including growth, development, reproduction and defense. Many terpenoids have reported therapeutic properties such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and chemotherapeutic properties, making them highly interesting in the medical field. Also, they are widely used in the flavors and fragrances in industries, in addition to being a source of biofuels (Pazouki and Niinemets [2016]). Terpenoids are derived by repetitive fusion of the five-carbon units based on isopentane skeleton (Fig. [4.1](#page-2-0)). The terpenoidal backbone is synthesized from the two precursors: isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) through a different number of repeats, rearrangement, and cyclization reactions (Abdallah and Quax [2017]). On the basis of C5 units, we can classify the terpenoids as C5 (hemiterpenes), C10 (monoterpenes), C15 (sesquiterpenes), C20 (diterpenes), C25 (sesterpenes), C30 (triterpenes), C40 (tetraterpenes), and >C40 (polyterpenes) (Martin et al. [2003]). Terpene synthases/cyclases (TPS) are a family of enzymes responsible for synthesizing the vast array of terpenoid compounds. These enzymes are involved in catalyzing the rearrangement and/or cyclization of the precursors geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) to produce the different classes of terpenoids (Tholl [2006]). TPS genes are generally divided into seven clades, with some plant lineages having a majority of their TPS genes in one or two clades. This indicates lineage-specific expansion of specific types of genes (Table [4.1](#page-3-0)). The TS genes were classified into the terpene synthase (TPS) family, and into more specific subfamilies, or as triterpene cyclases (TTCs), or squalene synthases (SSs) (Boutanaev et al. [2015]). The interesting structural diversity of terpenoids is based on the orientation of the substrate in the active site, which undergoes a series of cyclizations and/or rearrangements to produce a certain terpenoid by the associated TPS (Bohlmann et al. [1998]). TPS are generally classified into class I and class II TPS based on their substrate activation mechanisms. Class I TPS are characterized by catalyzing the ionization of the allylic diphosphate ester bond in their isoprenyl substrates, while class II TPS catalyze protonationinduced cyclization reaction of the substrate followed by rearrangement (Tholl [2006]). Class I TPS are ionization-initiated and the active sites are located within a domain, which adopts a common a bundle fold. The aspartate-rich residues (DDXXD) bind a magnesium cluster that triggers the departure of the substrate diphosphate leaving group and concurrently initiates the cyclization and rearrangement reaction. Class II TPS are the protonation-initiated and the corresponding active sites reside between b/c domains, both of which exhibits an a-barrel fold, in which a DXDD motif in the b domain provides the proton donor that triggers initial carbocation formation (Kampranis et al. [2007]). There has been an extensive study on the analysis of plant TPS with respect to understanding function and evolution of the TPS family (Chen et al. [2011]; Bohlmann et al. [1998]).Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP450) are heme-containing enzymes catalyze a wide variety of monooxygenation reactions in primary and secondary metabolism in plants. The largest group of P450s is found in plants is one reason for the immense amount of structurally diverse natural products in this kingdom. CYP450s catalyze a large variety of reactions like aliphatic and aromatic hydroxylations, N-, O-, and S-dealkylation, oxidative deamination, sulfoxide formation or N-oxidation (Schuler [1996]). Phylogenetic analyses, based on translated raw DNA sequence data, have spaced the CYP450s into 10 clans that include 59 families and an extensive number of subfamilies. The sequence identity between distantly related CYP450s is very low, but a few absolutely conserved sequence motifs (such as the WxxxR motif, the GxE/DTT/S motif, the ExxR motif, the PxxFxPE/DRF motif and the PFxxGxRxCxG/A motif) are observed to be important substrate recognition sites (Gotoh [1992]). Based on phylogenetic classification, the type of CYP450s is distinguished with its family number and subfamily letter, with shared numbers used for orthologs in different species and unique numbers used for paralogs in the same species. The nomenclature for P450s comprises of the CYP prefix, followed by an Arabic numeral which designates the family shares more than 40% identity with one or more previously confirmed P450s. Furthermore, if two CYP450s share more than 55% identity, they are considered to be members of the same subfamilies, designated with a capital letter and an Arabic numeral designates the individual gene (Nebert et al. [1991]; Chapple [1998]). The characterization and functions of CYP450s have been studied systematically in many organisms (Nelson [2009]) [http://drnelson.uthsc.edu/CytochromeP450.html](http://drnelson.uthsc.edu/CytochromeP450.html).\\', \\'ref_7:Represented in organisms across the tree of life, terpenoids comprise the largest family of natural products totaling over 100,000 known compounds.− This wide array of compounds all arise from the condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate to make a variety of isoprenoid substrates. These substrates are often cyclized by a family of enzymes that remarkably all share the so-called terpene synthase (TPS) fold. Class I TPSs are classified as mono-, sesqui-, and diterpene synthases according to their preferred substrates geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate, respectively. As a consequence of the labile carbocation chemistry involved after ionization of the diphosphate group, the suite of potential products is large. Product output is both narrowed and tailored, however, via stereospecific interactions with residues in the active site that raise the energy of some intermediate conformations, thereby disallowing those catalytic pathways. Nevertheless, TPSs are known for their promiscuity, wherein several minor products are produced in addition to the main product, for which the synthase is generally named. Plants host, by far, the largest number of terpenoids where they help in warding off herbivore attacks, attracting pollinators, regulating growth, and facilitating wound healing. Commercially, terpenoids are used in flavors and fragrances as antimicrobials and as therapeutics for diseases like malaria and cancer.Elucidating how this vast biosynthetic diversity emerged requires detailed mapping of biochemical and biophysical properties across the accessible sequence space of the family, defining the sequence–function landscape. We addressed this question experimentally using two sesqui-TPSs that share 75% sequence identity from the Solanaceae family, tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (TEAS), and Egyptian henbane premnaspirodiene synthase (HPS). These bind and cyclize FPP within a catalytic pocket in the C-terminal domain to generate 5-epi-aristolochene (5EA) and premnaspirodiene (PS) via a common Eudesmyl carbocation intermediate (Figure 1a). Plant mono- and sesquiterpene synthases also have an N-terminal “vestigial” domain of unknown function proposed to have distinct evolutionary origins from the catalytic C-terminal domain (Figure 1b). After identifying nine divergent positions in and around the active site of TEAS and HPS, we interconverted the enzymes’ product specificities by swapping the residues at these sites (Figure 1c). Following this work, we constructed and assayed the product profiles of a combinatorial library consisting of all possible residue combinations (512 = 29) in the tobacco enzyme (denoted as the M9 library, Figure 1e,f). Product profiles are very sensitive to changes at these nine sites, and many HPS-like variants were mutated at combinations of sites beyond the active site surface, indicating that specificity-determining factors are not restricted to the active site. In addition, epistatic contributions to the product specificity were quantified to reveal the importance of residue–residue coupling or positional epistasis as a determinant of TPS catalytic output. While this work led to powerful insights about an interconnected set of positions in TEAS, it allowed us only a limited view of whether our conclusions about their roles would hold in the HPS background. We address this gap by constructing the full 512-member HPS M9 library and assaying each product profile by GC–MS. Analyses of this library suggest that HPS is bent toward the accurate production of native product, while TEAS M9 library mutants tend to be far more promiscuous. We observe the strong sensitivity of this 9-position adaptive landscape to sequence context as well as its ruggedness. In addition, this difference in robustness highlights the benefit of mutational screenings using multiple related genes since even if they are functionally similar, the properties of their local sequence–function landscapes can be highly context dependent.The 512 × 2 = 1024 mutant library reported here emphasizes the combinatorial explosion that would occur should we wish to include more than 9 of the 135 divergent sites between TEAS and HPS or more than one single amino acid change. Therefore, we employed direct coupling analysis (DCA), which uses statistical inference to model the sequence space of the entire TPS family starting from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of native homologues. Our model assumes that the fold and functions of TPS family members are facilitated by interacting networks of residues and that when one member of the network is changed, its partners must be changed as well in order to maintain functionality during the historical expansion of the family. This coevolutionary information-based modeling has been used to predict structure and dimer interfaces, engineer novel LacI-based gene expression repressors, and it is related to protein stability.Here, we find that coevolutionary information not only predicts the TPS fold but also captures catalytic features, such as substrate and product specificity. In the case of the HPS mutant library, it even captures product diversity, hinting that the structural determinants of synthase promiscuity can also be controlled by coevolving networks of amino acids. Our model also helped to elucidate the distinct roles of amino acid pairs involving sites spanning the N- and C-terminal domains. Our results show that in HPS, the intradomain pairs drive catalytic specificity, while in TEAS, interdomain pairs play a bigger role in catalytic specificity than pairs, where both positions are in the catalytic domain. In order to assess the generality of these catalytically active interdomain pairs across the family, we developed a technique similar to one previously used by Cheng et al. to identify cognate two-component signaling protein pairs. Our analyses reveal that despite these sets of interdomain site pairs being among the highest ranked in the model, the residues in these sites are not widely conserved. To determine the structural basis for the divergence in functional roles of interdomain connectivities, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of WT HPS. Structural comparisons of HPS and TEAS reveal that the strongest interdomain pairs predicted in our model are indeed close contacts at the interface between the two domains; in addition, their influence on catalysis is plausible because they are nearby active site residues and M9 positions. Overall, our work demonstrates the combined power of large experimental data sets with global computational models of sequence space to characterize adaptive landscapes.\\', \\'ref_8:We cloned a novel cDNA (SpFPPS) from S. pararoseus. TLC analysis showed that SpFPPS had activity in vitro. SpFPPS synthesized the sole product FPP regardless of the allylic substrate (DMAPP or GPP) that was utilized. The functions of FPP synthases had previously been used to study Anthonomus grandis, and the major product of AgFPPS was found to be FPP using DMAPP with IPP as substrates. In fungus, FPP accounts for 75% of FPPS final products in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, extracts of XdFPPS formed C10 and C15 allylic pyrophosphates. Consistent with SpFPPS, they can use DMAPP or GPP as substrates, but in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, only geranyl diphosphate served as the MtFPPS acceptor; the difference is that the enzyme activity product of SpFPPS is only FPP.FPP provided a precursor for downstream synthesis of GGPP and other metabolic pathways, and most SCIPPSs catalyzed one specific product. However, some SCIPPSs have been reported to have two or even three enzyme activities (Table 1), and their products are also different. Perhaps the functional diversity of enzymes is to be attributed to their structural differences or is related to their long-term evolution. Furthermore, the reason why multifunctional enzymes prefer the above species to other organisms is still unclear and needs further exploration. Comparing the CLD of SpFPPS with that of other species, it was shown that the structural characteristics of SpFPPS were consistent with the FPPSs of birds and humans (Figure 1A). According to the characteristics of CLD, SpFPPS was classified as a type I FPPS. The phylogenetic tree of SpFPPS with the FPPSs of other organisms obtained from the NCBI was constructed by the neighbor-joining method (Figure 1B). The tree had two branches, involving two independent non-homologous isoprenoid biosynthesis metabolic pathways: the mevalonate pathway (MVA) and the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway (DOXP/MEP). A branch of the phylogenetic tree was type I FPPSs, where the Rhodotorula toruloides FPPS was most similar to SpFPPS. SpFPPS had significant homology with R. toruloides, Phaffia rhodozyma and Sanghuangporus baumii, all of which belonged to the type I FPPSs. They had similar characteristics and mechanisms of chain length determination. Another branch contained type II and type III FPPSs. The FPPSs in E. coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus are type II FPPSs. Dhiman et al. identified a type III ω,E,E-farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase from M. tuberculosis, and they reported that the ω,E,E-farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase seems to be most similar to the type I GGPPSs from archaea, both containing the DDXXD motif. The characteristic similarity between type I GGPPSs and type III FPPSs indicated that there is a probable evolutionary relationship between the two enzymes.The length of the isoprenoid chain synthesized by SCIPPS is determined by the depth of the hydrophobic pocket inside the protein. In NGR SpFPPS, an aromatic ring from Y forms the base of the pocket, which is located before FARM (Figure S4). Therefore, we hypothesized that the fifth amino acid residue upstream of FARM in SpFPPS was an aromatic amino acid (Y90), which is an important residue that blocks the extension of the FPP chain (Figure S4). In addition, the Y aromatic ring was replaced with a mutation of the smaller side chain to assess whether it would lead to the formation of longer chain products. Yan et al. isolated and identified the GGPPS from NGR, which was classified as a type III GGPPS according to its CLD characteristics; the fifth amino acid upstream of FARM was A. Previous studies reported that the FPPS in Toxoplasma gondii has FPPS/GGPPS bifunctional activity. Li et al. mutated the upstream fifth cysteine (C) to Y, which converted the enzyme into absolute FPPS to generate only FPP; they determined that the C at the fourth position is vital for TgFPPS bifunctionality, and the C corresponded to Y in SpFPPS. Therefore, we replaced the 90th Y with A and K, and the mutant recombinant proteins SpFPPS-Y90A and SpFPPS-Y90K were obtained. The in vitro enzyme activity results showed that IPP reacted with the substrate DMAPP or GPP, that the enzyme activity product was FPP and that no other chain length product was produced in the enzyme activity system containing SpFPPS. The mutants showed different properties. SpFPPS-Y90A produced FPP and GGPP with DMAPP or GPP as the substrate and had FPP/GGPPS bifunctional enzyme activity. Interestingly, the only product of SpFPPS-Y90K was FPP. However, when C20 GGPP was used as the substrate, the product of SpFPPS-Y90K was C15 FPP. Therefore, we considered that the mutation changed the structure of the protein so that it had the function of hydrolyzing the substrate. The reaction mechanism needs further exploration. As the biosynthetic pathway of S. pararoseus isoprenoids is elucidated more fully, it will be possible to further explore the detailed mechanism of FPPSs and to construct engineering strains.\\', \\'ref_9:In order to identify possible molecular targets of compound 1, we used a chemical proteomic approach, one of the most versatile methods to profile cellular targets of selected drug candidates based on compound-immobilized affinity chromatography. To this goal, the hydroxyl group at position C-2 of compound 1, not crucial to its biological activity, was used to link the compound to an epoxy-activated sepharose resin (See Supplementary Figure S1). Reaction conditions were selected to prevent modification of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group shown to be essential for the activity of this class of compounds. The obtained drug-linked beads were incubated with protein extracts from Jurkat cells (human T lymphoblast-like cell line), selected for their susceptibility to 1, as previously reported. After incubation for 30 minutes, the beads were extensively washed to remove non-specific interacting proteins and the tight-bound ones were eluted and digested using trypsin as proteolytic agent. Negative control experiments were simultaneously performed, using the same resin capped with ethanolamine. The obtained peptide mixtures were analysed by high-resolution nano LC-MS/MS, and the MS and MS/MS resulting data underwent bioinformatic elaboration by Mascot Search Engine software.Chemical proteomic experiments were performed in triplicate and only those proteins identified in all the experiments were taken into account; proteins identified from both 1-modified and control beads were excluded. Using this strategy, we identified the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) and the nuclear receptor PPARγ as putative targets of 1 (Fig. 2a). These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis (See Supplementary Figure S2).Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was employed to test the ability of compound 1 to interact with the proteins identified in the chemical proteomic experiments; to this goal, different concentrations of the diterpene were injected on the putative target proteins, singularly immobilized on sensor chips. The obtained sensorgrams (Fig. 2b) showed an effective interaction of 1 with PPARγ; a software-aided elaboration of the results allowed measuring an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 25.8\\\\u2009±\\\\u20095.5\\\\u2009nM for the 1/PPARγ complex. SPR analysis was also performed using the immobilized PPARγ LBD to evaluate if this protein portion was involved in the interaction with 1; the obtained results (KD of 39.2\\\\u2009±\\\\u20093.9\\\\u2009nM) were almost superimposable with those achieved using the whole protein, indicating that 1 binds that protein region. Conversely, no affinity of the diterpene towards Hsp60 was observed (Fig. 2c).To assess the potential of 1 to act as a PPARγ modulator, we investigated the structural and functional aspects of its interaction with this nuclear receptor. To define the structural features required by 1 for an efficient interaction with PPARγ, as a first step, we performed SPR analyses using some diterpenes displaying structural relationship with 1 (compounds 2–9, Fig. 1). Rosiglitazone, a well-characterized PPARγ full agonist, was used as positive control. All these compounds displayed an affinity towards PPARγ lower than that of 1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S3).In particular, the lack of the α,β-unsaturated keto group significantly affected the interaction with PPARγ, strongly increasing both thermodynamic (KD) and kinetic (koff) dissociation constants (cfr. compounds 2 and 3 vs 1). Compounds 2 and 3 share the same scaffold and type of substituents on ring A, lacking only the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety in comparison to 1. Since this modification results in a decreased ligand affinity for PPARγ, it is tempting to speculate that these compounds do not covalently bind to but can still weakly interact with PPARγ. Diterpenes 4–7 with different substitution pattern on rings A-B are completely inactive, suggesting a critical role of hydroxyl group in 2 and methyl ester in 4 for binding to the receptor. In contrast, compounds 8 and 9, even if contain the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, adopt a substantially different conformation of the perhydrophenanthrene nucleus, leading to severe steric clashes with the protein. This might impair the access of the ligands to the PPARγ LBD, explaining why their binding is not detected in SPR analysis.In order to evaluate if 1 acts as a selective ligand of PPARγ, SPR analyses were also carried out on immobilized PPARα and PPARδ, two proteins structurally and functionally related to PPARγ. No binding occurred between 1 and PPARδ; conversely, some interaction with PPARα was observed, the measured KD (1.32\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.08\\\\u2009μM) for 1/PPARα complex was about 50-fold higher than that detected for the 1/PPARγ complex (Fig. 2d,e). Comparison between the sensorgrams achieved for 1/PPARα and 1/PPARγ interactions revealed that the binding phases were similar, but the dissociation kinetics were clearly different: the 1/PPARα complex was completely dissociated after less than 50\\\\u2009s, whereas the 1/PPARγ complex dissociation required longer times and was incomplete.The high stability of the 1/PPARγ complex and the presence in the PPARγ-LBD sequence of a cysteine residue (C285) highly reactive towards nucleophilic groups such as α,β-unsaturated ketones, prompted us to investigate whether 1 could form a covalent bond with the protein. To this purpose, we investigated the presence of covalently modified peptides by performing a classic MS-based peptide mapping on the 1/PPARγ-LBD complex using trypsin as proteolytic agent. This analysis covered most of the protein sequence (See Supplementary Table S1); besides, a doubly charged ion at m/z 665,844 was observed, suggesting that 1 was covalently bound to peptide 281–288 (Fig. 3a). This hypothesis was confirmed by MS/MS analysis of this ion (Fig. 3b) that revealed the modification at C285 via Michael addition (Fig. 3c).To verify whether compound 1 could form a covalent bond with Hsp60, we performed the same protocol as above. Also in this case, the analysis covered most of the protein sequence and detected all the cysteine-containing peptides, but no peptide covalently modified by compound 1 (See Supplementary Table S2). The result of this experiment and the analysis of the SPR data indicated that Hsp60 cannot be considered a target of compound 1; its occurrence as a “false positive” is not very surprising as Hsp60 isoforms have often been identified in proteomic-based protein interaction studies (197 times on 411 studies on human cells reported on CRAPome database – http://www.crapome.org/), whereas PPARγ was not identified in any of them.To further confirm that compound 1 forms a covalent bond with PPARγ, we performed the SPR experiments as described, with the protein immobilized on the sensor chip after a 2\\\\u2009h incubation with a 5-fold molar excess of 1. As expected, this pre-incubated protein did not interact with injected 1 (See Supplementary Figure S4).We employed the covalent docking protocol CovDock implemented in the Schrödinger Suite to visualize possible conformational states of the C285 thioether resulting from the reaction with 1. CovDock uses different tools of the Schrödinger Suite to mimic distinct stages of covalent inhibitor binding. The first step is a classical non-covalent docking with an alanine mutation of the nucleophilic side chain followed by an automated bond formation and a second docking step with the covalent bond in place. The basic concept of the software is that a covalently bound ligand has to adopt an energetically favorable unbound pose before bond formation occurs and that these unbound poses do not dramatically change during the reaction pathway because conformational sampling is done solely prior the non-covalent docking step.The large number of crystal structures published in the PDB and the induced-fits in the PPARγ binding pockets upon ligand binding made difficult the choice of a crystal structure for docking. For instance, residues F282, R288, F363 and Y473 adopt different conformations among the available crystallographic structures and induce alterations in volume and shape of the binding site, allowing a better binding of the ligand. Moreover, the region between H2′ and H3 of PPARγ, called Ω-loop, comprises the most flexible part of the LBD and has recently been suggested to be an important modulator of PPAR function in addition to or in combination with H12. This region is usually poorly structured in many PDB structures, while in others it is ordered. For these reasons, we adopted a systematic PDB selection process in order to assess which crystal structure should be used as a model to accurately dock compound 1 into the protein. Virtual screening was conducted on a number of PPARγ crystal structures using a library of known PPARγ partial agonists and a set of decoy compounds. Each docking model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and enrichment factors. The best performing crystal structure for docking was found to be 3B3K with a ROC value of 0.80 and an enrichment factor of 9.5 at 2% of the virtual screening. Details about the PDB selection process are reported in the Experimental Procedures section.The PPARγ ligand-binding pocket has a Y-shaped form and can be divided into two sub-pockets, a) the activation function 2 (AF-2) and b) the β-sheet sub-pocket. In order to activate PPARγ, partial agonists bind only the β-sheet sub-pocket, while full agonists always occupy both AF-2 and β-sheet sub-pockets. A low-energy pose of 1 covalently bound to C285 was predicted by CovDock and this conformation, which adopts a R configuration at position 16 of the Michael acceptor, is stabilized by several H-bonds with the key residues in the β-sheet sub-pocket. Unlike Rosiglitazone, which takes a U-shape conformation in the ligand-binding pocket and wraps around H3 to directly contact the AF-2 helix (H12), compound 1 occupies the region delimited by H3 and β-sheet (β-sheet sub-pocket) and makes no contact with H12 or residues involved in co-activator recruitment (Fig. 4a,c), as already observed in structures of complexes with partial agonists, such as those with BVT.13, MRL-24 and nTZDpa. In contrast, the full agonist Rosiglitazone occupies roughly 40% of the PPARγ ligand-binding site in a U-shaped conformation and consists of a polar head and hydrophobic tail. The polar head makes a net of H-bonds with S289, H323, H449 and Y473 side chains, while forming a hydrophobic region with F363, Q286, F282 and L469. Despite the fact that 1 binds in a different mode from Rosiglitazone, occupying the β-sheet sub-pocket, the ent-kaurane skeleton of 1 overlaps the hydrophobic region of Rosiglitazone when the two structures are superposed (Fig. 4b).The carbonyl and the ethereal oxygen atoms of the ester group at position 4 of the ligand form two H-bonds, one with the NH backbone of S342 (located at the β-sheet) and one with both NH2 and Nε of R288 side chain on H3. The hydroxyl group at position 2 establishes a H-bond with the C=O backbone of I281 (dOH-O\\\\u2009=\\\\u20092.8\\\\u2009Å) as well as a very weak H-bond (dOH-N\\\\u2009=\\\\u20094.1\\\\u2009Å) with the side chain of H266, located at the Ω loop that links H2 to H3. Non-polar contacts are observed along the full extension of the 1 molecule. These contacts start at the Ω-loop of the protein, and extend all the way through the ligand-binding pocket. Residues involved in these interactions include F264 (part of the Ω-loop), I281, G284, and F287 on H3, V339, I341 and M348 on the β-sheet, L330 (H5), and M364 (H7). It is important to note that the Ω-loop is highly unstable and the residues within this loop are quite flexible; thus, the observed ligand/Ω-loop contacts cannot be easily quantified and must be interpreted accordingly.To verify that 1 is a bona fide PPARγ ligand with transactivation ability, we transiently transfected a PPRE-TK-luciferase-reporter plasmid in HEK293 cells that, in addition to the endogenous protein, stably express an exogenous PPARγ. These cells were selected as they express a fixed and known amount of PPARγ, so that the differences in luciferase activity can be ascribed to the different ligand used. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of Rosiglitazone or 1 for 24\\\\u2009h and luciferase activity evaluated. Rosiglitazone induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner reaching a peak at 0.8\\\\u2009μM and declining at higher concentrations (Fig. 5a). Compound 1 displayed a transactivation activity that was about 40% lower than Rosiglitazone, with a peak at 1\\\\u2009μM.At relevant concentrations, many small molecules self-associate into colloidal aggregates that act nonspecifically on protein targets and exhibit bell-shaped concentration–response curves. To mitigate this, use of nonionic detergents, which can disrupt aggregates, is now common in target-based screens. We then checked whether addition of a detergent, such as 0.001% Tween 20, to the medium could affect the aggregation status of the ligand and hence the transactivation effect on the luciferase reporter gene. We did not find any variation in the bell-shaped activity profile of compound 1 (Supplementary Figure S5). So, we assume that the reduced reporter gene transcription efficiency operated by 1 is independent of the status of the ligand. All together, these results clearly demonstrate that 1 behaves as a partial agonist of PPARγ.Finally, the identification of PPARγ as a target of 1 provided the molecular basis of the previously reported anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of 1. We demonstrate that these activities are mediated through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway, in accordance with in vitro data obtained using other known PPARγ activators. By using the irreversible PPARγ antagonist GW9662, we reinstate HT-29 cells ability to proliferate, counteracting the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Figs 6 and 7). On the basis of these results, we believe that 1 could be a promising lead for the development of new therapeutic and/or biochemical tools endowed with both anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic as well as anti-diabetic properties.\\', \"ref_10:The reagents HL1 and HL2 were prepared by reacting the respective pyrazoles with ethyl isothiocyanoacetate. The molecular structures of the compounds were confirmed by the spectral studies. The empirical formula of HL1 was determined by mass spectroscopy from the exact mass of the molecular ion. IR spectrum of HL1 exhibits the absorption bands due to the ester group (ν(C=O) 1743 cm–1) and amide fragment (ν(N−H) 3325 cm–1). The analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of HL1 and the comparison of the chemical shifts of the signals and of the spin–spin coupling constants for this reagent with that for the initial pyrazole [8] shows that the molecule of HL1 contains the unchanged chiral tetrahydrocyclopropa[3,4]cyclopenta[1,2-c]-pyrazole fragment, which provides the optical activity to the compound as a whole. The mass spectrum of HL2 contains the intense peak due to the molecular ion. The accurate measurement of its mass confirms the empirical formula corresponding to the product of addition of 3,5-dimethylpyrazole at the isothiocyanate group of ethyl isothiocyanoacetate. IR spectra of HL2 contain the absorption bands due to the ester group (ν(C=O) 1743 cm–1) and the amide fragment (ν(N−H) 3319 cm–1), while the 1H and 13C NMR spectra give evidence of the 3,5-dimethylpyrazole fragment and amide derivative of ethyl aminoacetate. UV spectra of HL1 and HL2 are very similar, which suggests the presence of identical functional groups in their molecules. The reaction of copper(II) chloride with HL1 in the mixture of ethanol–acetonitrile at the initial concentration cCu = 0.06 mol/l and the molar ratio Cu : HL1 = 1 : 1 yielded compound I. The reaction carried out in ethanol and with the initial concentration cCu = 0.25 mol/l and the same molar ratio of Cu : HL2 resulted in compound II with similar composition. Complexes I and II are stable in air and well soluble in CHCl3, CH2Cl2, but poorly soluble in EtOH, water, and hexane. The composition of the complexes suggests the coordination of the anionic forms of the initial reagents HL1 and HL2. These reagents contain C=S group. In a number of cases when ions of Cu(II) react with the compounds incorporating this group (thiourea and its derivatives), Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I). The magnetic susceptibility measurements showed that in the interval of 78–300 K, the values of µeff for complexes I and II do not change with temperature and are equal to 1.88 and 1.84 µB, respectively. These data indicate that complexation of copper(II) chloride with HL1 and HL2 is not accompanied by the reduction of copper(II). The unpaired electrons of copper(II) ions are unlikely to be involved in any noticeable exchange couplings.The crystal structure of complex I consists of the asymmetrical molecules (Fig. 1a). The copper(II) ion in complex I coordinates four nearest atoms: Cl– ion (Cu–Cl 2.174(4) Å, two nitrogen atoms (Cu–N(1) 2.01(1), Cu–N(3) 1.983(9) Å, and carbonyl O(1) atom (Cu–O(1) 2.20(1) Å) in the organic ligand, formed on detachment of a proton from NH group of compound HL1. The coordination of this anionic ligand results in the closure of five-membered metal cycles CuN3C and CuNOC2. The coordination sphere of Cu atom involves also the thione S atom of the neighboring molecule (Cu–S\\' 2.708(4) Å). Thus, the coordination polyhedron of Cu atom is a distorted square pyramid (CN = 4 + 1). The Cu atom extends from the mean plane of the pyramid base ClN2O by 0.26 Å toward the axial vertex. The Cu–S vector forms the angle of 87.5° with the plane of the pyramid base; the Cu–S–C(11) angle is equal to 97.7°. The S atoms of the neighboring molecules located at the pyramid vertices act as the bridges thus forming a chain stretched along the axis ‡ (Fig. 2). Hence, the organic anion behaves as a tetradentate cyclic bridging ligand. The shortest distance Cu–Cu corresponds to a translation and equals 5.477(1) Å. The chains weakly interact with one another. The minimum Cl–C(9) contact is 3.74(2) Å (Fig. 3). In the ligand, the distances C(2)–N(1) 1.35(2), C(4)–N(2) 1.34(2), C(13)–O(1) 1.21(2), and C(11)–S 1.70(1) Å correspond to double bonds. The C(3)–C(4) and C(2)–C(3) distances equal to 1.38(2) Å are shorter than the ordinary C–C bond, which suggests the delocalization of electrons in the pyrazole cycle. It is noteworthy that the C(11)–N(3) distance (1.25(2) Å) in the CuN3C metal cycle is very short and the C(11)–N(2) distance equal to 1.39(2) Å is also rather short, which can be explained by the delocalization of electrons in this cycle. Finally, one can see that the bonds between atom C and the ester O(2) atom are inequivalent. The remaining C–C and N–N distances correspond to the ordinary bonds (Table 3). Two metal cycles in complex I are almost planar, and the deviation of atoms from the mean planes does not exceed 0.066 Å (for N(2) atom). The dihedral angle between the metal cycle planes is 14.6 Å. The five-membered pyrazol cycle and carbocycle are also planar, the dihedral angle between their planes is equal to 2.3°. The dimethylcyclopropane fragment is located at the angle of 65.6° to the plane of the neighboring carbocycle and at the angle of 66.7° to the common mean square plane of both five-membered cycles. Unlike the chain structure of complex I, the crystal structure of complex II consists of pseudodimers. The structure of one pseudodimer, which incorporates two crystallographically independent molecules, is shown in Fig. 1b. The anion of HL2, like the anion of HL1, performs the function of the tetradentate cyclic bridging ligand, which is also coordinated to form five-membered CuN3C and CuNOC2 metal cycles. The coordination polyhedra of the Cu(1) and Cu(1*a*) atoms are the distorted square pyramids, whose bases each accommodate two N(1), N(3) and N(1*a*), N(3*a*) atoms, one carbonyl O(1) and é(1*a*) of the anionic ligands, and one Cl(1) and Cl(1*a*) atom. The Cu–N, Cu–O, and Cu–Cl distances are close to the standard distances (Table 3). Both Cu(1) and Cu(1*a*) atoms deviate from the planes of the pyramid bases by 0.14 Å. The S(1) and S(1*a*) atoms are located at the vertices of these pyramids. The distances Cu(1)–S(1*a*) 2.945(4) and Cu(1*a*)–S(1) 2.950(4) Å are less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of Cu and S (~3.75 Å, [10]). The S(1) and S(1*a*) atoms behave as the bridges and thus favor the formation of pseudodimers. The Cu(1)–S(1*a*) and Cu(1*a*)–S(1) vectors are almost parallel to one another (the angle between them being 1.5°) and make the angles of 88.2° and 87.9° with the pyramid planes, respectively. The distance Cu(1)–Cu(1*a*) in the pseudodimer is equal to 5.345(2) Å. The possibility of formation of a pseudodimer in a solid state of II, instead of the chain as in complex I, can be explained by the fact that HL2 does not contain neither the five-membered carbocycle nor the sterically hindered dimethylcyclopropane fragment, which are present in HL1. The metal cycles and pyrazole cycle of both independent molecules in pseudodimer II are nearly planar with the maximum deviation from the mean planes being less than 0.052 Å for molecule 1 and 0.11 Å for molecule 1*a*. Since the dihedral angles between the five-membered cycles in both molecules does not exceed 3°, one can assume the tricyclic fragment in each CuL2 Cl molecule to be a single planar system. With this assumption, the molecular planes in the pseudodimer are parallel to one another. The structures of molecules in pseudodimer II somewhat differ, in particular, in the bond lengths between the atoms of pyrazole cycles and in the lengths of the C(6)–N(3) and C(6*a*)–N(3*a*) bonds in the CuN3C metal cycles (Table 3). Note that the differences in the lengths of the C–O(ester) bonds in pseudodimer II are considerably smaller than in complex I. The mutual arrangement of pseudodimers in complex II is shown in Fig. 4. Each pseudodimer has weak H bonds with the \\'neighboring\\' pseudodimers. The shortes contacts (Cl(1*a*)···H(92) 2.89, Cl(1)···H(7*a*) 2.79 Å) are represented in Fig. 4 by dotted lines.The fact that the unpaired electrons of the copper(II) ions do not show any noticeable exchange interactions in the polyspin complex I and in two-spin complex II can be explained by inefficiency of the shortest exchange CuSCNCu channel connecting the neighboring Cu(II) ions. The EPR spectrum of a powder of the pseudodimeric complex II has a typical axial-anisotropic form of a line with g|| = 2.25 and g⊥ = 2.06 at the line width 100 and 50 G, respectively. The spectrum does not show the superfine structure, which suggests the magnetoconcentrated phase, while the ratio g||/g⊥ is common for isolated copper(II) ions with the basic orbital. These facts imply that the symmetry axes of the coordination Cu(II) polyhedra are parallel to one another in the crystal structure. The above-mentioned peculiarities of the spectrum of compound II in solid phase agree with X-ray diffraciton data. The orbitals of two copper(II) ions are parallel to each other, but they do not overlap, which explains the absence of the noticeable antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between unpaired electrons of the copper(II) ions. The EPR spectra of the frozen solutions of complex II in toluene or CH2Cl2 contain a broad (~60 G) asymmetric line with the average g-factor ~2.11 that lacks the superfine structure. In addition, a similar line with the lower intensity and g = 4.2 is observed in a weak magnetic field. One can conclude that the observed EPR spectra belong to the binuclear associates, which are contained in a solution and have the structures similar to that of pseudodimer II in the solid state. Evidently, the pseudodimer remains unchanged on dissolution in toluene or CH2Cl2. When ethanol was used as a solvent, we attempted to partially destroy these associates. The spectral parameters for monomeric adduct of complex II with ethanol are g|| = 2.28, A|| = 125 G, and g⊥ = 2.06. One should note that the associates are rather stable, and after the addition of 10–15% ethanol into toluene or CH2Cl2, the greater part of the complex remains as the binuclear associates. For the EPR spectrum of complex I in solid phase with the chain structure, g1 = 2.038, g2 = 2.11, g3 = 2.265, and W1 = 35, W2 = 55, W3 = 50 G. The EPR spectrum of complex I in CH2Cl2 corresponds to that of the dimer with asymmetric shapeless lines in the region of the ground and forbidden transitions. Hence, in the indicated solution, complex I forms the same binuclear associate as complex II. As was previously established, the reactions of copper(II) salts with the potentially bioactive 3,5-dimethyl-1-N-methyl- and 3,5-dimethyl-1-N-ethylthiocarbamylpyrazoles yield the complexes, whose ligands are the molecules of pyrazole drivatives [11]. This study revealed that Cu(II) chloride reacts with HL1 and HL2 to give complexes I and II with anions of the thione form of the starting reagents as ligands. The anions acting as tetradentate cyclic bridging ligands are coordinated in the same mode and produce the square pyramid coordination polyhedra. At the same time, the fact that the structures of HL1 and HL2 are different in the sterically hindered carbocyclic fragment encountered in HL1 is responsible for the chain structure of complex I in a solid state and for pseudodimeric structure of complex II.\", \\'ref_11:Terpenoids are the largest and a structurally diverse group of natural products in plants. To date, more than 80,000 terpenoid compounds, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes, have been identified. Terpenoids play important roles in both primary and secondary metabolism of plants. For example, gibberellin, brassinosteroid, and carotenoid are well characterized terpenoids, which play important roles in plant growth and development as plant hormones and photosynthetic pigments. Compared to the small amount of terpenoids involved in primary metabolism, the majority of terpenoids are classified as secondary metabolites. Although they are not involved in the basic growth and development of plants, they still have some physiological functions and a wide range of applications, including plant defense response, pharmacological compounds, and fragrance and aroma constituents. Although the number of terpenoids is huge, they are all derived biosynthetically from common precursors, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). These precursors are produced by two biosynthetic pathways, the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP) in the chloroplast and the mevalonate pathway (MVA) in the cytosol. The condensation reaction of DMAPP and IPP catalyzed by prenyltransferases produces the direct precursors geranyl diphosphate (GPP C10), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP C15), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP C20). Subsequently, terpene synthases (TPSs) catalyze the precursors to form a variety of terpenoids, including hemiterpene (C5), monoterpene (C10), sesquiterpene (C15), and diterpene (C20). The products of TPS can be further modified by other enzymatic reaction, such as dehydrogenation, isomerization, and group transfer. In the biosynthetic pathway of terpenoids, TPSs is positioned at the branch point and is a key enzyme for terpenoid biosynthesis.Each full-length TPS is characterized by two conserved domains with Pfam ID PF01397 (N-terminal) and PF03936 (C-terminal). The N-terminal domain has a conserved RRX8W motif, and the C-terminal domain has a conserved DDXXD motif and NSE/DTE motif. TPSs constitute a mid-size gene family, the number of which varies greatly in different plants. To date, TPS gene families have been genome-widely identified in various plant species, ranging from spermatophytes to mosses. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the plant TPS family can be classified into seven subfamilies (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, TPS-d, TPS-e/f, TPS-g, and TPS-h). Different subfamily genes also encode terpene synthase with different functions, for example, TPS-a subfamily genes encode sesquiterpene synthases, while TPS-b and TPS-g subfamily genes encode monoterpene synthases. TPS-d is a gymnosperm-specific subfamily, which performs several functions, such as diterpene, monoterpene, and sesquiterpene synthases. The TPS genes could also been classified into different classes according to their genomic structure, including class I (13-15 exons), class II (10 exons), and class III (7 exons).\\', \\'ref_12:The structural coverage of complexes of THC analogs and cannabinoid receptors presently spans AM841, CP55940 and AM11542 bound to CB1, and AM12033, CP55940 and HU243 bound to CB2. The resolution of the structures spans 2.8–3.4\\\\u2009Å and three structures are fully activated cryo-EM complexes with Gi1-2, whereas the AM11542-CB1 complex is a crystal structure with a fusion protein, flavodoxin, that restrains TM6 in an active state. The overall coverage of the CB1 protein sequence in active-state structures ranges between 58% and 62% of residues (Supplementary Table 1). This limited coverage is due to the intrinsic flexibility of the N-/C-termini and the long third intracellular loop (ICL3). THC has a tricyclic core consisting of phenyl, pyran, and cyclohexene rings that are indexed A, B, and C, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). Opening of the pyran ring leads to compounds referred to as Cannabidiols that have weaker affinity to CB1-2 and psychoactivity than the THC class. Numerous THC analogs have been developed and published, among which HU-210 is one of the most potent tool compounds. HU210 is 100–800 times more potent than naturally sourced THC in discrimination tests in animal studies and has a binding affinity at human CB1 that is ~700 higher than for THC. HU243 is a close structural analog of HU210, differing just by the lack of a double bond in C8-C9 of the C ring, sharing its high potency. Additional potent synthetic THC analogs include the widely used tool compound, CP55940 as well as AM841 and AM11542. In contrast, the phytocannabinoid Cannabinol and synthetic ligands L759633 and JWH133 have lower affinities and potencies at CB1 and less strong psychoactive effects than THC. Inverse agonism is observed for Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCv) which has the opposite effect of THC by suppressing appetite and controlling blood glucose levels, making it a potential treatment for obesity and diabetes. Structure-activity relationship studies of THC have focused mainly on the three major pharmacophore features: (i) the phenolic hydroxyl group at the C1 position on the A-ring, (ii) the methyl group at the C9 position on the C-ring, and (iii) the alkyl side chain at the C3 position on the A-ring (Supplementary Fig. 1). C1 phenolic hydroxyl removal (JWH133) and etherification (L759633) increase selectivity for CB2 over CB1 activation by 153-fold and 200-fold, respectively. Substitution of the C9 methyl with hydroxyl (CP55940) or carbonyl (Nabilone) groups improves affinity, but not selectivity. A shorter and longer alkyl tail compared to THC decreases and increases binding affinity and potency, respectively, and five to eight carbons are considered optimal. Elongation with large halogens at the terminal position (as in AM11542) increases binding affinity. Binding affinity can also be enhanced by methyl substitution at the C1’ and C2’ positions. Here, 1′,2′-substitution gives as good binding affinity but 1′,1′-dimethyl substituted compounds are easier to synthesize. Hitherto, these and other structure-activity studies have predominantly focused on analog substitutions correlated to binding activity or selectivity, and assessment of potency has been typically addressed as effective dose in vivo. This leaves a need for more molecular mechanistic studies covering ligand-receptor interactions and dissecting additional pharmacological parameters under consistent experimental conditions.Here, we benchmark the potency and efficacy of Δ9-THC and 10 analogs (Supplementary Table 2) for the recruitment of the primary transducer family, Gi/o and β-arrestin. Furthermore, we solve the cryo-EM structure of the HU210/CB1/Gi1 signaling complex and leverage this template to obtain consistent ligand binding modes and spatiotemporal interactions through 1000\\\\u2009ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Combining these approaches, we expand the structural rationale of THC analogs beyond ligand moieties to dynamic receptor interactions delineating determinants for potency, efficacy, kinetics, and biased signaling. The ligands included in this study include Δ9-THC and analogs of both Δ9-THC and Δ8-THC. Δ8-THC is a structural isomer of Δ9-THC, differing only in the location of the double bond in the C-ring. Whilst Δ9-THC has a double bond at the C9 position with C10 (Supplementary Fig. 1), Δ8-THC has a double bond at the C8 position with C9. Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) is a derivative of Δ9-THC that lacks a double bond in the C-ring. Therefore, the analogs included in this work can be classified in the following manner. Δ9-THC analog: Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCv); Δ8-THC analogs: AM11542, HU210, JWH133, L759633; HHC analogs: AM841, CP55940, HU243, Nabilone. Cannabinol differs from THC by having an aromatic C-ring.\\', \\'ref_13:Structural insight into the mechanisms underlying class II diTPS catalysis remains limited with presently only two crystal structures of class II diTPS active sites available, the Arabidopsis ent-CPP synthase (AtCPS) and the class II/I enzyme Abies grandis abietadiene synthase. All class II diTPS share a common three-domain (γβα) fold with the active site being formed by the N-terminal γ and β domains. A conserved catalytic DxDD motif controls the general acid-base mechanism to bring about the cyclization of GGPP with the middle Asp residue functioning as the general acid. A high-resolution crystal structure of AtCPS further showed that GGPP protonation through this conserved Asp involves proton transfer via a hydrogen-bonded proton wire linking the active site cavity to the bulk solvent. Additionally, the functional catalytic base of AtCPS was identified as a water molecule coordinated by a dyad of two His and Arg residues conserved among ent-CPP synthases. Numerous structure-guided mutagenesis studies further identified active site residues relevant for the terminal deprotonation of the labda-13-en-8-yl+ intermediate rather than quenching of the carbocation by hydroxylation at C-8 or C-9, as well as the cascade of possible 1,2-hydride and methyl shifts toward different CPP double bond isomers and enantiomers. This study reports the crystal structure of GrTPS2 at 2.1 Å of resolution. Structural analysis and site-directed mutagenesis studies highlight active site residues contributing to GrTPS2 activity and product specificity toward forming the 7,13-CPP isomer, thus providing insight into the functional divergence of the class II diTPS family.The X-ray data collection and statistical analysis of the final refinement of GrTPS2 structure are shown on Table 1. GrTPS2 adopts the common class II diTPS γβα-domain structure comprised of three helical domains that closely resemble the reported structures of the class II ent-CPP synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB ID 4LIX), the class I diTPSs Taxus brevifolia taxadiene synthase (PDB ID 3P5P), and the bifunctional class I/II abietadiene synthase from A. grandis (PDB ID 3S9V). The N-terminal segment (residues 1–18) and a short region of the J-K loop in the α-domain (residues 563–566) are disordered in the GrTPS2 structure (Fig. 2). Consistent with other class II diTPSs, the C-terminal α-domain lacks helices α1 and G1 and helices D, F, H, and I are shorter as compared to class I diTPSs resulting in a non-functional class I active site (Fig. S1). The N-terminal region, including the first helix, folds back to represent part of the β-domain as previously observed also for AtCPS. The GrTPS2 class II active site is formed by the γ- and β-domains, which adopt the typical ɑ-barrel structure and closely resemble the AtCPS active site (Fig. 3A). AtCPS E211, predicted to be involved in substrate binding and the catalytic DIDD motif, including D325 as the general acid functioning in substrate protonation, is conserved in GrTPS2 (E157) and situated at the bottom of the active site cavity (Fig. 3B). By contrast, a His-Asn dyad, previously shown to be important for catalytic specificity in AtCPS and other ent-CPP synthases, is replaced with Tyr (Y209) and Thr (T268) residues located at the top of the active site (Fig. 3B). Structural analysis of AtCPS had further demonstrated solvent channels, comprised of select active site residues (e.g., D503, R340, R337, D336), and coordinated water molecules that connect the bulk solvent with the general acid Asp residue of the DIDD motif (D379) to facilitate proton transfer during the catalytic reaction. The respective GrTPS2 residues, namely D449, R286, R283, and D282, are conserved in GrTPS2 and coordinate several water molecules. Specifically, the general acid D325 forms a water channel to E419 with water molecules W21, W120, W145, and W162 in near-identical position as compared to the solvent channel identified in AtCPS. Additional waters W89, W104, and W165 connect E419 to the D449 residues creating a conserved water solvent network also observed in AtCPS (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, another water molecule (W318) is connected to this channel through a hydrogen bond with Y275. To identify additional active site residues with potential impact on GrTPS2 catalysis, the GGPP substrate analog, (S)-15-aza-14,15-dihydro-geranylgeranyl thiolodiphosphate (aza-GGSPP), was docked into the GrTPS2 class II active site using a predicted active site cavity and the position of aza-GGSPP in the AtCPS structure as a spatial constraint. All residues present within a 6Å sphere around the docked ligand were selected and further evaluated using protein sequence alignment of GrTPS2 and functionally characterized plant class II diTPSs to identify amino acids either uniquely occurring in GrTSP2 or matching active site positions shown to impact catalytic specificity in other class II diTPSs (Fig. S2). This included Y209 and T268 in the position of the HN dyad critical for product specificity in ent-CPP synthases, as well as the neighboring F269 and T272 that, to our knowledge, are unique to GrTPS2. While the aromatic ring of F269 faces the docked ligand with a distance as close as 3.6Å, T272 is situated at the bottom of the active site cleft on the opposite site of the ligand as compared to the general acid DID325D motif (Fig. 4A). In addition, F315 is positioned in close proximity to the substrate analog, whereas residue Y457 is located 3.5Å away from the ligand. Lastly, Y457 is located in an active site position previously reported to impact product specificity in the rice syn-CPP synthase, OsCPS4, the switchgrass class II diTPSs, PvCPS38 and PvCPS3, which produce syn-CPP and 8,13-CPP, respectively (Fig. 4A).\\', \"ref_14:The inhibitions of c-Met kinase were investigated referred to a published literature. The IC50 values were detected using TR-FRET. 50 nM 6 His-tagged recombinant human c-Met residues 974-end (Millipore) was cultured in medium containing 2.5 m mol/L MnCl2, 10 m mol/L MgCl2, 20 m mol/L Tris, 2 m mol/L DTT and 0.01% Tween 20 with 5 m mol/L ATP and 200 n mol/L 5FAM-KKK -SPGEYVNIGFG-NH2 with 25 μL at room temperature for 60 min. Compounds were made up to 100 μM solutions and were tested with 10 concentration gradients by two times dilutions. Each group was tested for three times Reactions were termined by IMAP stop solution. Plates were incubated for an overnight and analyzed by using AiphaQuest.Molecular docking was performed according to related reference. The docking experiment was carried out with CDocker program which was connected with Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.5.5. The programs adapted an empirical scoring function and a patented searching engine. Briefly, ligands were docked into the corresponding protein\\'s binding site complied with protocol, which was generated by ligand from the crystal structure of 3DKC with random hydrogen atoms and GasteigereHückel charges but not water and ligands other parameters were default values except that the threshold was 1. The structure of receptor was minimized to 10,000 cycles using Powell method in DS 2.5.5. The geometries of all compounds were optimized by conjugate gradient method of TRIPOS. The convergence criterion was identified as 0.001 kcal/mol. The MD simulations were performed on the basis of molecular docking by using AMBER 10.0 for ligands and AMBER ff03 for protein, and using Gaussian 03 program to calculate partial atomic charges at a neutral pH, with histidines 164 and 200 protonated at δ position, and using SHAKE algorithm to restrict all the bonds given the time step of 2 fs and cutoff distance of 8 Å with long-range electrostatic interactions treated with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method. The heating operation was carried out from 0 to 300 K in 50 ps using Langevin dynamics at a constant volume and equilibrated for 100 ps at a constant pressure of 1 atm after four steps of minimizations, which included 2500 cycles of steepest descent minimization, followed by 2500 cycles of conjugated gradient minimization. Heavy atoms of receptor-ligand complex were restrained to 0, 10, 100, and 500 kcal/ (mol Å2) and were 10 kcal/ (mol Å2) during the heating and equilibration steps while solvent molecules were not restricted. Finally, periodic boundary conditions of 8 ns were performed for the whole system with normal pressure of 1 atm and normal temperature of 300 K in the production step. For each system, ΔGpred values were calculated using 100 snapshots recorded from the last with 1 ns trajectory an interval of 10 ps by Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area method.\", \\'ref_15:The chemical structure of DIH (C20H28O2) is shown in Figure 1A. DIH was obtained from the natural diterpene hispanolone following the procedure described by Pérez-Sirvent et al. and the corresponding 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data are shown (Supplementary Materials and Figures S1 and S2). To evaluate the effect of DIH on cell viability, J774A.1 cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations for 24 h and cytotoxic effects were determined using the MTT assay. As shown in Figure 1B, no significant changes in cell viability were observed in J774A.1 macrophages treated with DIH at concentrations up to 20 μM. Based on these results, DIH at a concentration of 10 and 20 μM was mostly used for further experimentation.Molecular docking has proven to be an efficient strategy to speed up the process of drug discovery, in addition to being a powerful tool for understanding different protein functions. Indeed, it is an effective strategy in structure-based virtual screening. In the present study, molecular docking was performed in order to examine the possible binding mode, as well as to confirm the anti-inflammatory activity of DIH via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. As is well known, among the NLRs, NLRP3 is the most studied of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) family and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins (NLRs). Furthermore, NLRP3 is composed of an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) that is the effector domain for supramolecular complex formation; a central triple-ATPase domain called NACHT that mediates protein oligomerization upon activation; and a C-terminal LRR domain that may act as the signal sensor. A set of conserved Cysteines present in the NACHT domain are important for inflammasome activation. ADP-bound NLRP3 is thought to be in an autoinhibited state that is relieved by the action of various kinases. This includes phosphorylation of the activation loop upstream of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and interaction with the mitotic serine/threonine kinase NEK7. NLRP3 can be activated by a wide range of stimuli, including ATP, K+ ionophores, heme, particulate matter, pathogen-associated RNA and bacterial and fungal toxins and components. In healthy tissues, the plasma membrane of living cells is impermeable to ATP and ATP remains intracellularly linked to metabolism. Thus, extracellular levels of ATP are low. However, in distressed or damaged tissues extracellular ATP concentrations rise and act as a potent danger signal through the activation of purine receptors in effector cells. The release of ATP into the extracellular milieu could be due to a lytic-passive release coupled with cell death or non-lytic regulated release. ATPase activity within the NACHT domain is also mandatory for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3 actually needs to cleave ATP into ADP in its ATPase pocket in order to achieve the active conformation. Whatever stimulus triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation, conformational changes are required in the switch from the inactive resting conformation to the active structure that, in its turn, can trigger a downstream cascade. All of this suggests that blocking ATPase activity might be a feasible strategy with which to target the design of compounds that can inhibit those syndromes associated with inflammatory disorders. In order to offer a better understanding of the significant inhibitory activity of DIH as well as to explore its possible binding mode, conventional (non-covalent) and covalent docking studies were carried out using the Glide software on the reported crystal structure of NLRP3 NACHT domain in complex with the potent inhibitor MCC950 analog (PDB 7ALV). Thus, DIH was docked in the same binding site as the MCC950 analog and also in the nucleotide-binding site where ADP is bound in the closed conformation of the crystal structure. An in-depth analysis of the non-covalent docking result showed that the best docking poses for DIH (docking score: −5.24 kcal mol−1) occupy less surface area than the cognate ligand at the NLRP3 ligand binding site. Furthermore, it can also be observed that there is only a single key hydrogen bond interaction for receptor affinity between the carbonyl group of DIH and the residue Ala 228 while observing that the number of bad contacts is much higher compared to those interactions observed by the cognate ligand. The highest docking scores were observed in the range from −3.51 to −5.24 kcal mol−1 whereas the inhibitor MCC950, used as a reference, showed a docking score value of −8.50 kcal mol−1, suggesting that these interactions are not so effective in providing a stabilizing effect to the protein-ligand complex formed. In accordance with the above and taking into consideration that DIH has an α, β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety in its structure that could act as a Michael acceptor, a covalent docking was carried out at the ATP binding site. Michael acceptors are able to react with biological nucleophilic residues, such as cysteine, serine, lysine and histidine, found in proteins and thus form covalent bonds. These observations allow us to hypothesize that the NLRP3 inflammasome could be a sensitive target to be inhibited by DIH. Thus, it can be seen how the DIH compound fits very well and it is located exactly in the same region where the nucleotide is located, occupying a large portion at the ATP binding site (Figure 8). As we expected, the docking result showed that our compound binds covalently to NLRP3, forming a covalent bond between Cys415 and the β carbon of the α, β unsaturated carbonyl moiety. In addition, another important aspect that can be derived from the predicted pose of DIH is the ability to also form two new hydrogen bond interactions, one of them between the carbonyl group with an Arg167 residue and another hydrogen bond interaction formed by the oxygen of the furan ring with a Thr169 residue. A π-π-stacking interaction between the furan ring with a residue of Phe373 was also observed, as well as multiple potential hydrophobic interactions involving residues such as Ile 151, Ile 234, Tyr 168, Thr169, Arg 167, Tyr381, Phe373, Pro412, Leu413, Trp416 and HIE522 (Figure 9). Lastly, it is worth highlighting that the cdock affinity values calculated for the DIH compound (cdock affinity range of −8.04 to −8.83 kcal mol−1), when compared with the scores obtained for the bioactive diterpenoid oridonin (cdock affinity −7.14 kcal mol−1), which was used as the reference compound in the in silico study, it is evident that our compound binds efficiently to the ATP binding site of the inflammasome. In conclusion, and in contrast to other Michael acceptors, our analysis has revealed that DIH forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the NACHT domain, thereby potentially blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and NEK7, preventing a conformational change and avoiding the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through the inhibition of its ATPase activity.\\', \\'ref_16:Introduction: Terpenoids are one of the most diverse and abundant classes of natural products, comprising more than 80 000 compounds.<sup>1</sup> Terpene synthases (TPSs; also referred to as terpene cyclases) are responsible for generating the structural diversity of cyclic skeletons and are classified into classes I and II based on differences in their cyclization initiation mechanisms (elimination of diphosphate or protonation of double bonds).We selected proteins with 3D structures similar to those of known class I and subclass TPSs (Sat1646 (ref. 17) from bacteria: class I; BalTS13,14 from bacteria: class IB; AsR6 (ref. 16) from fungi: class IC) as candidates for the non-canonical TPSs (Fig. 1a–c). To reduce the number of target proteins, we analyzed hypothetical proteins located within ±10 genes of E-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (E-IDS), which biosynthesizes the substrate for TPSs on the genomes of actinomycetes of the genera Streptomyces, Mycobacterium, and Nocardia (Fig. 1a and b). This strategy should be applicable to various biological species and genome locations; however, to demonstrate the strategy efficacy, we selected the above restricted conditions. After excluding proteins with similarities to all known TPS sequences (Fig. 1d), we detected ten proteins as non-canonical TPS candidates from the genomes of 268 actinomycetes species (Tables S2, S3, Fig. S1†) and classified them into six types (types 1–6) based on their sequence similarities (E value < 0.1). As a representative for analyzing type-1, MMAR2565 from Mycobacterium marinum discovered using the above search was selected. Regarding types 2–6, since the origin of detected genes was difficult to obtain, homologs from easily available bacterial strains or genomes were analyzed (Fig. 1e, Table S3, Fig. S1†). In addition, the functions of type-1 (MMAR2565) homologs were also analyzed to confirm that the homologs distributed in various bacterial species (E value < 10−5 : currently 120 species; Fig. 2a) are non-canonical TPSs (Fig. 1e). Seven type-1 homologs (PeuTPS, NioTPS, CmeTPS, HtsTPS, SceTPS, SpaTPS, and HauTPS) from various phylogenetic groups, including nonactinomycetes (Fig. 2a, Table S3†), were selected for functional analysis.\\', \\'ref_17:Compound 6 (0.5 mg) was dissolved in dry pyridine (2.0 mL) and mixed with 50 mL of Ac2O. The mixtures were stirred at room temperature overnight, and the reaction was detected on the TLC by heating after spraying with vanillin H2SO4 reagent. The crude acetylated product, after evaporating the solvent in vacuo, was purified by silica gel CC (petroleum ether/ether, 9:1) to afford a colorless crystal compound 1a (0.5 mg, 87% yield), which was identical to the natural sample of 1 in all respects (Figure S1.10).Lobocaline A (1): colorless crystals, m.p. 68.9–71.6 °C; monoclinic, 2(C22H34O3), Mr = 692.98, crystal size: 0.11 × 0.05 × 0.04 mm3, space group P21, a = 10.6135(3) Å, b = 16.2226(5) Å, c = 11.8888(4) Å, V = 2044.73(11) Å3, Z = 2, ρcalc = 1.126 g/cm3, F (000) = 760.0. Independent reflections: 7619 with Rint = 0.0385, Rsigma = 0.0475. Final R1 = 0.0479, wR2 = 0.1174 reflections with I ≥ 2σ (I), R1 = 0.0523 (wR2 = 0.1215) for all unique data, Flack parameter: 0.00(10). The crystals of 1 were recrystallized from MeOH at room temperature. Crystallographic data for 1 were deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (Deposition nos. CCDC 2290865). Lobophytrol B (15a): colorless crystals, m.p. 119.1–177.0 °C; monoclinic, C20H36O4, Mr = 340.49, crystal size 0.15 × 0.08 × 0.05 mm3, space group I4, a = 14.6887(3) Å, b = 14.6887(3) Å, c = 37.2232(11) Å, V = 8031.2(4) Å3, Z = 16, ρcalc = 1.126 g/cm3, F(000) = 3008.0, 57940 collected reflections, 8240 independent reflections (Rint = 0.0620, Rsigma = 0.0327), final R1 = 0.0399 (wR2 = 0.1022) reflections with I ≥ 2σ (I), R1 = 0.0431, wR2 = 0.1051 for all unique data, Flack parameter: 0.12(7). The crystals of 15a were crystallized from acetone at room temperature. Crystallographic data for 15a were deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (Deposition nos. CCDC 2290866).Compound 1, namely lobocaline A, was isolated as colorless crystals and gave the molecular formula of C22H34O3 as established by HRESIMS from the protonated molecular ion peak observed at m/z 347.2580 [M + H]+ (calcd. for C22H35O3, 347.2581), implying six degrees of unsaturation. The characteristic peak at νmax 1737 cm−1 in its IR spectrum showed the presence of ester carbonyl group, which was further confirmed by the diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift at δC 170.6. The 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1 and Table 2) of 1 along with the assistance of DEPT spectrum revealed the presence of two trisubstituted double bonds [δH 6.06 (1H, d, J = 10.8 Hz, H-2), δC 118.6 (CH, C-2) and 146.9 (qC, C-1); δH 5.97 (1H, d, J = 10.9 Hz, H-3), δC 135.1 (qC, C-4) and 121.7 (CH, C-3)], one exocyclic double bond [δH 5.15 (1H, s, H-19) and δH 5.18 (1H, s, H-19), δC 146.8 (qC, C-8) and 113.0 (CH2, C-19)] and one epoxy ring [δH 2.86 (1H, dd, J = 7.5, 4.6Hz), δC 61.0 (CH, C-11) and δC 61.6 (qC, C-12)]. The above-mentioned moieties accounted for five of the six degrees of unsaturation, indicating the monocyclic carbon framework for 1. A comparison of the NMR data of 1 with those of the co-occurring known compound sarcoboettgerol D (6), which had been recently isolated from soft coral Sarcophyton boettgeri and its absolute configuration was determined by the TDDFT-ECD calculation method, which revealed that they were structural analogues, with the only difference being that the hydroxyl group at C-7 in 6 was substituted by an acetyloxy group at C-7 in 1, in agreement with the 42 mass unit difference in their molecular weights. The position of the acetyloxy group at C-7, as evidenced by the observation of the upfield shift of C-6 from δC 32.9 in 6 to δC 30.0 in 1. This assignment was further confirmed by strong HMBC correlations (Figure 2) from H-7 (δH 5.16) to C-19 (δC 113.0), C-8 (δC 146.8) and carbonyl carbon (δC 170.6). Thus, the planar structure of 1 was determined as shown in Figure 2.The relative configuration of 1 was established mainly by the analysis of NOESY correlations (Figure 2). The clear NOE correlations of H-2 (δH 6.06)/H3-16 (δH 1.10), H-2/H3-18 (δH 1.78) and H-3 (δH 5.97)/H-5α (δH 2.24) indicated the “1E, 3E” geometry of the two double bonds Δ1,2 and Δ3,4. The highly similar NOE correlations of H-7/H-9β, H-9β/H-10β and H-10β/H3-20 and H-9α/H-11 between compounds 1 and 6 suggested that these two compounds shared the same stereochemistry. Furthermore, the suitable single crystals of 1 in MeOH were obtained. The X-ray crystallographic analysis using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) firmly disclosed the absolute configuration of 1 to be 7R, 11S, 12S with the Flack parameter of 0.00 (10) (Figure 3, CCDC 2290865). What is more is the acetylation of 6 yielding 1 further confirmed the structure and stereo-configuration of 1. The chemical structure of 1 was thus established as shown in Figure 1.Lobocaline B (2), a colorless oil, gave the same molecular formula as 1 on basis of its HRESIMS ion peak at m/z 347.2581 [M + H]+ (calcd. for C22H35O3, 347.2581). Overall, the 1H and 13C NMR data of 2 (Table 1 and Table 2) were reminiscent of 1. Careful comparison of their NMR data revealed they possessed the same planar structure and only chemical shifts at C-7 (δC 72.5 in 1 vs. δC 75.9 in 2) were different, suggesting that 2 was simply the C-7 epi-isomer of 1, thus suggesting the assignment of 7S*, 11S*, 12S* configuration of 2. Further analysis of 2D NMR spectra and the obvious NOESY correlations of H-7/H-11 confirmed this hypothesis (Figure 2). Subsequently, the absolute configuration of 2 was then assigned to be 7S, 11S, 12S by the comparison of similar experimental ECD spectra of compounds 1 (Figure S1.9) and 2 (Figure S2.9). Accordingly, the structure of 2 was determined as depicted in Figure 1.Lobocaline C (3) was isolated as a colorless oil, and its molecular formula was assigned as C20H32O2 by HRESIMS ion peak at m/z 327.2295 [M + Na]+ (calcd. for C20H32O2Na, 327.2295), indicating five degrees of unsaturation. The 1D NMR data of 3 (Table 1 and Table 2) showed great similarities to those of lE,3E,7E,11:12-epoxy-l,3,7-cembratriene, a known cembranoid isolated from the South Andaman Coast soft coral Lobophytum sp., with the only difference being the presence of an additional hydroxyl group at C-6 in 3, in agreement with the 16 mass unit difference between these two compounds. This assignment was further confirmed by the strong 1H–1H COSY correlations of H-6 (δH 4.54)/H-7(δH 5.30) (Figure 2). As mentioned above, the planar structure of 3 was determined as shown in Figure 2. The geometries of the double bonds at Δ1,2, Δ3,4 and Δ7,8 were both assigned to be E by the NOESY correlations of H-2 (δH 5.94)/H3-16 (δH 1.05), H-2/H3-18 (δH 1.78) and H-7 (δH 5.30)/H-9α (δH 2.30) (Figure 2), respectively. The relative configurations of C-11 and C-12 in 3 were proven to be the same as those of 1 due to the diagnostic NOESY correlations of H3-20 (δH 1.25)/H-10b (δH 1.46), H3-20/H-13b (δH 2.00), H-11 (δH 2.82)/H-3 (δH 5.92) and H-11/H-14a (δH 2.36). To figure out the relative configuration of 3, the QM-NMR calculation was performed to give the best match of more than 99% probability in DP4+ with the 6R*, 11S*, 12S* isomer (see the details in the Supplementary Materials). The absolute configuration of 3 was determined by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) ECD calculation. The theoretical ECD spectrum of 3 was calculated by the DFT method at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. As a result, the Boltzmann-averaged ECD spectrum of (6R, 11S, 12S)-3 highly matched the experimental ECD spectrum of 3, while the calculated ECD spectrum of enantiomer showed a completely opposite curve (Figure 4). Consequently, the absolute configuration of 3 was established to be 6R, 11S, 12S.Lobocaline D (4), a colorless oil, has the same molecular formula (C20H32O2) as that of 3, implying they are isomers. Comparison of 1H and 13C chemical shifts of 4 and 3 (Table 1 and Table 2) followed by a detailed analysis of 2D NMR data revealed that the structure of 4 was similar to that of 3 with a different substituted position of the hydroxyl group. This conclusion was further supported by HMBC correlations from H3-18 (δH 1.74) to C-5 (δC 78.1) and 1H–1H COSY correlations of H-5 (δH 4.12)/H-6α (δH 2.39)/H-7 (δH 5.19). Thus, the planar structure of 4 was determined. The relative configurations of C-11 and C-12 in 4 were assigned to be the same as those of 1 due to the similar 13C NMR data. Similarly, the relative configuration of 4 was also elucidated via QM-NMR calculations using the DP4+ protocol. The best match was observed for the 5R*, 11S*, 12S* relative configuration with a DP4+ probability over 99%. Moreover, the absolute configuration of 4 was further determined by the TDDFT-ECD approach. As shown in Figure 5, the Boltzmann-averaged ECD curve calculated for the (5S, 11R, 12R)-4 enantiomer matched very well with the experimental ECD spectrum of 4. Accordingly, the absolute configuration of 4 was determined to be 5S, 11R, 12R.Lobocaline E (5) was obtained as a colorless oil. Its molecular formula, C22H34O3, was deduced from the ion peak observed at m/z 369.2397 [M + Na]+ (calcd. for C22H34O3Na, 369.2400) in its HRESIMS spectrum. The 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1 and Table 2) of 5 were extremely similar to those of the co-occurring compound 4, indicating that they are structural analogues. In fact, the only difference between these two compounds is the replacement of the hydroxyl group at C-5 in 4 by the acetyl group at C-5 in 5, in agreement with the 42 mass unit difference between compounds 4 and 5. To determine the relative configuration of 5, the theoretical and experimental NMR data were correlated and their corresponding DP4+ probabilities were estimated. Consequently, the candidate structure 5a (Figure S11.3) showed the dominant probability of 99.52%, indicating the 5R*, 11S*, 12S* relative configuration of 5. In this case, the TDDFT-ECD calculation was also employed to determine the absolute stereochemistry of 5. As shown in Figure 6, the calculated ECD spectrum of (5S, 11R, 12R)-5 fairly matched with the experimental one, allowing us to assign the absolute configuration of 5 to be 5S, 11R, 12R. Moreover, the hydrolysis reaction of 5 was also performed, but unfortunately, no product was detected due to the low number of isolated compounds. The chemical structure of 5 was thus established as depicted in Figure 1.\\', \\'ref_18:Terpenes are the largest group of natural products with important and diverse biological roles, while of tremendous economic value as fragrances, flavours and pharmaceutical agents. Class-I terpene synthases (TPSs), the dominant type of TPS enzymes, catalyze the conversion of prenyl diphosphates to often structurally diverse bioactive terpene hydrocarbons, and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). To measure their kinetic properties, current bio-analytical methods typically rely on the direct detection of hydrocarbon products by radioactivity measurements or gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).Terpene synthases (TPSs) catalyze the transformation of linear, achiral isoprenoid diphosphates into structurally diverse, often polycyclic and stereochemically complex terpene hydrocarbons. Class-I TPSs, the dominant type of TPS enzymes, are metal-dependent carbon–oxygen lyases (EC 4.2.3) which operate by cleaving the C–O s-bond of the pyrophosphate ester functionality of the substrate to generate a carbocation that can then undergo a series of electrophilic cyclizations and rearrangements. The enzymatic reaction (or catalytic cycle), is terminated by carbocation neutralization via proton loss or addition of a nucleophile to produce a hydrocarbon and a molecule of inorganic pyrophosphate [\\\\\\\\[10\\\\\\\\]](#page-8-0). Hundreds of cyclic monoterpene (C10) [\\\\\\\\[11\\\\\\\\],](#page-8-0) sesquiterpene (C15) [\\\\\\\\[12\\\\\\\\]](#page-8-0), and diterpene (C20) [\\\\\\\\[13,14\\\\\\\\]](#page-8-0) carbon skeletons result from the precise carbocationic-guided transformations (reaction cascades) mediated by the individual TPSs. Myriad downstream enzymes (cytochrome p450\\\\\\'s, glycosyltransferases, acyltransferases, etc.) subsequently tailor terpene hydrocarbon scaffolds to produce the wealth of terpenoids found in nature. An increasing body of sequence information from bioinformatics analysis of genomics data indicates that an enormous number of terpene synthases are encoded by plants and microorganisms with several hundred in bacteria alone [\\\\\\\\[15\\\\\\\\]](#page-8-0). These observations coupled with the biological and industrial importance of terpenes and TPSs, have recently motivated the development of novel biochemical methods for kinetic characterization of TPSs [\\\\\\\\[5\\\\\\\\],](#page-8-0) discovery of TPS enzymatic activity [\\\\\\\\[9\\\\\\\\]](#page-8-0), and chemical characterization of TPS enzymatic products [\\\\\\\\[15\\\\\\\\]](#page-8-0). While gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) has been the principle method for the analysis of volatiles produced by TPSs, the radioactive assay has been the bio-analytical tool of choice to assay the kinetic competency (or catalytic efficiency) of these enzymes. More recently, a GC–MS single vial assay was developed for product (sesquiterpenes) identification and adapted to enable enzyme characterization of libraries of <span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>mutant enzymes [7] and native plant TPSs [16] by standard steady-state kinetics [5,17] with nonradioactive material. Steady-state kinetics of sesquiterpene synthases has on occasion been determined by measuring the release of pyrophosphate (PPi) in a commercially available fluorometric assay kit (PiPerTM, Invitrogen). This later method however has not been, to our knowledge, validated against either of the well-established techniques (radioactive or GC–MS assay).\\', \\'ref_19:Four lanostane triterpenes (1–4) and an acyclic triterpene tetraol (5) were isolated from the n-hexane-soluble phase of the MeOH extract prepared from the mushroom P. populnea by a combination of multiple flash chromatography steps. The structure elucidation was carried out by extensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR (1H–1H COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and ROESY) and HRESIMS experiments. Based on the HRESIMS data, the molecular formulas of compounds 1 and 2 were C38H58O10 and C39H60O10, respectively, differing only in a methylene group. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1 and 2 (Tables 1 and 2) were similar except for a singlet signal with three-proton intensity at δH 3.71 appearing in the 1H NMR spectrum and the extra resonance at δC 51.7 in the 13C NMR spectrum of 2. These findings suggested that 2 was the O-methyl derivative of 1. In accordance with the elemental compositions, the 13C NMR spectra presented 38 and 39 resonances in compounds 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the HSQC spectra, besides the additional methoxy group in 2, 10 methyl, 10 methylene, and 5 methine groups, and 13 nonprotonated carbons were commonly present in the compounds. Considering the elemental compositions and the chemical shift values of the nonprotonated carbons, two carbonyl groups (δC 214.9/214.8 and δC 197.9/197.9), three carboxylate moieties (δC 173.7/172.1, 170.8/171.2, and 171.4/170.6), an unsaturation (δC 139.2/139.1 and δC 163.1/163.0), and two sp3 carbons attached to oxygens (δC 76.2/76.2 and 69.6/69.5) were present in 1 and 2. The remaining four signals (δC 39.3/39.2, 40.5/40.5, 44.9/44.9, and 47.8/47.8 for 1/2) could be ascribed to sp3 nonprotonated carbons. Based on the characteristic HMBC correlations of the angular methyl singlets [H-18 with C-12, C-13, C-14, and C-17; H-19 with C-1, C-5, C-9, and C-10; H-21 with C-17, C-20, and C-22; H-29 and H-30 with C-3, C-4, and C-5], it was concluded that 1 and 2 are based on a lanostane skeleton. The HMBC correlations of the O-methine doublets at δH 4.85/4.83 with C-1, C-4, C-29, and C-30 confirmed their assignment to H-3 in 1/2, while HMBC cross-peaks of the O-methine groups at δC 70.3/69.9 (C-2) with protons at δH 4.85/4.83 (H-3) suggested that the lanosterol skeleton bears oxygen-containing substituents at both C-2 and C-3. The HMBC correlations of the acetyl CO signal with H-3 and the acetyl methyl signal suggested the presence of an acetate group at C-3, while, based on the HMBC correlations of H-2/C-1′, H-2′/C-1′, H-2′/C-3′, H-2′/C-4′, H-2′/C-5′, H-4′/C-5′, and H-5′/C-6′, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate moiety was attached to C-2 in compounds 1 and 2. The additional H-7′/C-6′ HMBC correlation in compound 2 suggested that 2 was the methyl ester of compound 1. Further to these, the HMBC correlations of the doublet of doublets at δH 1.88/1.85 (assigned to H-5) with C-4, C-10, C-19, C-29, and C-30 confirmed this assignment, while long-range correlations of H-5 with the methylene at δC 36.2/36.2 and with the carbonyl at δC 197.8/197.8 enabled the assignment of C-6 and suggested the presence of a keto group in position 7. In parallel, the HMBC correlations between the diastereotopic protons (H-22) and the methylene group at δC 32.6/32.5 (C-23) and carbonyl group at δC 214.9/214.8 (C-24) and between the methyl singlets of H-26 and H-27 and C-24 and nonprotonated carbon at δC 76.2/76.2 (C-25) led to the conclusion that a 24-keto-25-hydroxy side chain was present at C-17. Based on the complete 1H and 13C NMR assignments (Tables 1 and 2), compounds 1 and 2 were identified as fasciculic acid A derivatives. According to the observed NOE correlations of H-18 with H-11β, H-15β, H-16β, and H-20, those of H-19 with H-1β, H-2, H-11β, and H-29, and of H-28 with H-15α, H-16α and H-17, the relative stereochemistry as depicted in structural formulas 1 and 2 was proposed for the two compounds. Thus, compound 1, named as pholiol A, was assigned as the 3-O-acetyl-7,24-diketo analogue of fasciculic acid A, while pholiol B (2) was assigned as its methyl ester. The relative configuration of the C-3′ chiral center could not be determined on this basis and is only tentatively given as S, based on the close chemical shift values with those of similar compounds and on assuming that similar metabolic pathways led to the formation of the structurally similar compounds in the different fungal species. The molecular formulas of 3 (C38H60O10) and 4 (C39H62O10) derived from HRESIMS measurements differed only in a methylene group, similarly to those of compound pair 1 and 2. As compared to pholiols A (1) and B (2), compounds 3 and 4 contained two additional hydrogens, nominally corresponding to the saturation of the double bond in 1/2. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 3 and 4 were highly similar to those of compounds 1 and 2. The most striking differences were the presence of a triplet signal with one hydrogen intensity at δH 4.13/4.14 in the 1H NMR spectrum and in parallel the absence of the carbonyl resonance belonging to C-7 and the appearance of resonance at δC 72.8/72.8 in the 13C NMR spectrum of 3/4. Thus, at first sight, the reduction of the keto group at C-7 to a hydroxy group was envisaged. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 3 and 4 were almost identical, except for the presence of a singlet with a three-hydrogen intensity at δH 3.73 in the 1H NMR spectrum and a carbon signal at δC 51.7 in the 13C NMR spectrum of 4. This suggested that 4 was the methyl ester analogue of compound 3. Analysis of the HSQC and HMBC data showed that a hydroxy group was attached to C-12 (δH-12 4.13/4.14, each 1H, t, J = 7.7 Hz; δC-12 72.8/72.8 for 3/4; HMBC correlation between H-18 and C-12) and a methylene group was present in position 7 based on the HMBC correlation of H-5 and H-6 with C-7. 2D NMR experiments allowed the complete 1H and 13C NMR assignments of 3 and 4 as listed in Tables 1 and 2. Compound 3, named as pholiol C, was identified as the 24-keto derivative of fasciculic acid B, while pholiol D (4) was identified as its methyl ester. The similar chemical shifts and NOE correlations suggested that the relative configurations of the C-2, C-3, C-5, C-10, C-14, C-17, and C-20 (and C-1′) chiral centers of 3 and 4 were identical to those determined for pholiols A (1) and B (2). The NOE correlations of H-12 with H-11α, H-17, and H-28 (Figure S26) suggested that the hydroxy group occupied the β position (thus, the C-12 chiral center had an R configuration) in pholiols C (3) and D (4). Compound 5 was identified as (6E,10E,14E,18E)-2,3,22,23-tetrahydroxy-2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-6,10,14,18-tetracosatetraene regarding its 1H and 13C NMR chemical shift values, identical with literature data. The 3S,22S configuration of 5 can be suggested based on the opposite optical rotation data than that of the 3R,22R isomer. Compound 6 was found to be identical in all of its spectroscopic characteristics with that of ergosterol. 3β-Hydroxyergosta-7,22-diene was detected in the n-hexane fraction with the use of an authentic standard.The isolated compounds (1–6) were tested for their cytotoxic activity on sensitive Colo 205 and resistant Colo 320 cell lines and on the normal MRC-5 embryonal fibroblast cell line using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay with doxorubicin as a positive control. Among the studied compounds, ergosterol (6) showed substantial cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell lines with IC50 values of 4.9 μM (Colo 205) and 6.5 μM (Colo320) (Table 3). This compound was more potent against the MRC-5 cell line (IC50 0.50 μM). Pholiols B (2) and D (4) and compound 5 possessed weak inhibitory activities (IC50 > 25 μM) against the tested cell lines without any selectivity (Table S2). The inhibitory activities of compounds 1–3, 5, and 6 on efflux function were evaluated by measuring the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123, a well-known P-glycoprotein substrate fluorescent dye, within the Colo320 MDR cells. Tariquidar, a strong P-gp inhibitor, was used as positive control. All tested compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and the final concentration (2.00%) of the solvent was investigated for any effect on the retention of rhodamine 123. The results revealed inhibition of P-gp MDR efflux pump activity manifested by pholiols A (1) and B (2) and triterpene 5. In general, compounds with fluorescence activity ratio (FAR) values greater than 1 were considered to be active P-gp inhibitors, while compounds with FAR values greater than 10 were considered to be strong MDR modulators. The sterol compounds with methyl ester functionality (2) and the polyhydroxy-squalene derivative (5) exerted the highest anti-MDR effect in this bioassay with FAR values of 6.880 and 6.638, respectively. Compounds 2 and 4–6 were tested for their capacity to reduce the resistance of the MDR Colo 320 cell line to doxorubicin. A checkerboard microplate combination assay was performed, which is a widely used in vitro method for the assessment of drug interactions. Experimental data were analyzed using CompuSyn software, which enabled the determination of the most effective ratios of combined agents and calculation of combination indices (CI). Based on the combination indices, the type of interaction could be defined according to the literature. Pholiols B (2) and D (4), with a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutarate methyl ester moiety, and 5 interacted in an synergistic manner, and CI values at 50% of the ED50 were found to be 0.348, 0.660, and 0.082, respectively. The outstanding potency of 5, designated as very strong synergism (CI = 0.082), is promising. In this assay ergosterol (6) was found to have an additive effect in combination with doxorubicin. It is noteworthy that the tetrahydroxy-squlene derivative (5) has the capacity to potentiate the effect of doxorubicin in Colo 320 adenocarcinoma cells by P-gp modulation and strong synergism with doxorubicin, and therefore it represents a promising new class of potential adjuvants of cancer chemotherapy. With regard to the moderate P-gp inhibitory activity and strong synergism of 5 in combination with doxorubicin, the mechanism of its chemosensitizing effect should have another P-gp-independent mechanism. Compounds 1–6 were inactive against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and S. aureus 27213.\\', \\'ref_20:Molecular docking suggests bond simulations between molecules, that is, an efficient link between a macromolecule (receptor) and a small molecule (ligand), in this case between β-CD and POH, respectively, obtained from simulations/homology modeling. Molecule bound profiles have a particular feature of screening virtual libraries of substance-like molecules in order to obtain clues for further drug development. Docking was used to predict the conformation of POH/β-CD inclusion complex and to estimate bound conformations and binding affinity. Figure 1 shows the β-CD structure (A and B) and the inclusion of complex hydrogen bonds (C and D) that occur between POH and β-CD. The best binding position and anchor affinities, interaction molecules, interaction type and geometry distance (Å) are shown in Table 1. The hydrogen-bonds result from the presence of OH groups within the POH structure. This result suggests a stronger bond due to the lower affinity energy. These established hydrogen bonds also suggest that while CH2 and CH3 groups remain exposed, the main POH molecule is attached to the internal structure of β-CD. Molecular docking also allowed us to check the anchoring capacity of different POH amounts linked to β-CD, from which the 1:1 molar ratio was shown to be the most stable structure, thus selected for further studies. POH, β-CD and the complexes obtained upon physical mixture (PM), malaxation (MA) and co-evaporation (CO) were subjected to the analysis by DSC and TG/DTG. Figure S1 (Supplementary material) shows the DSC curve of β-CD depicting two endothermic peaks; the first recorded between 37.44 and 108.35 °C (−427.66 J/g) and the second between 300.45 and 346.99 °C (−578.10 J/g), attributed to water evaporation and decomposition, respectively. POH displayed a broad endothermic peak between 26.02 and 94.42 °C (−257.22 J/g), corresponding to its volatilization. The DSC curves of the raw materials (POH and β-CD) compared to those obtained by the analyses of the complexes (CO, PM and MA) confirm that the best interaction between the POH and β-CD was obtained with CO methodology; the POH reduction of the melting endotherm (73.14 to 127.40 °C, −29.41 J/g) was more significant compared to other methodologies (PM and MA). PM and MA show two endothermic peaks similar to the raw material’s profile, indicating the presence of the free form of β-cyclodextrin. The CO (POH:β-CD, 1:1) thermogram suggests that this method offers a more efficient complexation, attributed to the incorporation of POH in the internal cavity of β-CD. The melting event of POH shows a reduction in its peak. Additionally, during complexation, the water molecules present in the β-CD are removed and replaced by the guest molecule, thus favoring the formation of the complex and changing the thermoanalytical curve of the systems. Compared to CO, MA and PM approaches showed a smaller reduction in the melting peaks. The formation of the POH/β-CD inclusion complex was also studied by TG/DTG. Figure S2 (Supplementary material) shows the TG curves of POH and β-CD raw materials and the complexes obtained by CO, PM and MA. From the depicted data, the POH suffers decomposition and volatilizes before 100 °C is reached. β-CD shows a thermoanalytical profile, which can be split into four parts. The first depression involves water loss (12.97%). Between 100 and 250 °C, the TG curve is flat and a low mass loss is detected (0.32%) and the thermal decomposition (around 89.70%) occurs between 250 to 500 °C (confirmed by DTG). Then continuous carbonization occurs in a wide temperature range that is, from 500 °C to about 700 °C (Δm = 4.97%). A similar result has been described by Menezes et al.. A similar profile was observed for the PM, which shows the overlap of individual components indicating low interaction (and therefore low degree of interaction) between POH and β-CD. In the TG analyses of complexes, the first mass loss event can be attributed to the water evaporation. A reduction of the intensity of this step can be seen in the DTG curve of the inclusion complex obtained by CO; this indicates the higher probability of replacing water molecules in the β-CD cavity with the monoterpene. According to Mura et al., this can be explained by favoring hydrophobic interactions between POH and the nonpolar cavity of the β-CD resulting in a lower energy state, which favors the formation of the new structure. Then, a second, more pronounced mass loss event was seen, which corresponds to the degradation of β-CD. The data obtained by TG are in agreement with those recorded by DSC (Figure S1, Supplementary material). FTIR is useful to monitor the formation of an inclusion complex in the sample. Figure 2 displays the FTIR spectra of POH, β-CD and complexes obtained by PM, MA and CO. POH exhibited typical OH (free) axial deformations bands, characteristic of the hydroxyl group at 3596.8 cm−1, alkene CH at 3009.8 cm−1 and C=C at 1667.9 cm−1. Additionally, the bands observed in the 1500–1300 cm−1 region correspond to the C–C stretch absorption bands of the ring. The absorption bands β-CD shown between 3718–3072 cm−1 are reference OH group vibration and a strong band is seen from 3000 cm−1 to 3300 cm−1, resulting from the OH group stretching, which suggests water loss and subsequent hydrogen bond breakage and POH inclusion. Similar findings were reported by Trindade et al., who also verified cyclic structure C–H at 2800 cm−1, C–O stretch bands at 900 cm−1 and C=C at 1604 cm−1 and 1375 cm−1. PM spectra showed an overlap of the individual POH and β-CD bands, suggesting a weak interaction between POH and β-CD. Analyzing inclusion complexes spectra from MA and CO samples, there is an O–H axial deformation characterized by a narrow absorption band around 3500–3000 cm−1. Changes in intensity at this broad peak was associated with inclusion complex formation towards lower wavenumbers and decrease in intensity and broadening, upon complexation. Also, a significant reduction in the POH characteristic absorption bands occurs probably due to a vibration restriction following the complexation process. The inclusion complex showed small differences in comparison to that of PM and the raw materials, indicating the presence of a weakly bound, as a hydrogen bond. Figure 3 shows the SEM of the β-CD and the β-CD:POH (1:1) produced by CO methodology at 500× magnification. Pure β-CD appears as crystalline particles of different sizes without a defined shape. The inclusion complex showed a significant reduction of particles, resulting in compact and homogeneous agglomerates which indicate a modification of the crystal and the powder. When the POH is complexed in the β-CD cavity, the crystallinity of the complex resulted in a more amorphous character. SEM results show the homogenous β-CD crystal after the POH inclusion. Similar results were also obtained with other monoterpenes, as α-terpineol, carvacrol and citronellal.The results obtained in the present work indicate that for POH and for the inclusion complexes containing or not the monoterpene, resulted in 100% viability of human L929 fibroblasts after 24 h of incubation (Figure 4). These data suggest that both the isolated compound and the complex form are non-toxic to non-malignant cells, further demanding its evaluation in in vivo models. Antitumor therapy encounters serious adverse effects due to the nonspecific action of antineoplastic drugs, which can trigger damage both in tumor cells and in healthy cells, compromising the homeostasis of healthy tissues. Antineoplastic drugs induce a variety of metabolic damages to the patient, such as gastrointestinal disorders, nausea and immunosuppression, rashes, arthralgia, adynamia, neuro and nephrotoxicity, among countless others, in addition to the development of clinical resistance. Thus, the search for more selective, effective and/or less aggressive drugs to reduce these side effects is essential for a successful antineoplastic therapy. An increasingly growing interest in the search for products for anticancer therapy has been seen to promote the elimination or inhibition of tumor growth. The potential antineoplastic activity of the complex has been evaluated in a sarcoma 180 (S180) bearing mice. This model has the advantage of being easily handled for the implantation protocol, tumor growth up to 90% to 100% and rapid tumor evolution, which reduces the experimentation time. The histological analysis of tumors observed in the vehicle group were characterized by the formation of sheets and solid blocks of neoplastic cells, which deeply infiltrated the dermo-hypodermic tissue. In the dermal portion of the tumor, a discontinuous pseudocapsule was formed by loose fibrous connective tissue, with inflammatory reaction and moderate-intensity interstitial edema and infiltrated by neoplastic cells. The tumors exhibited extensive areas of intraparenchymal coagulative necrosis, forming large masses of irregularly shaped borders, which, in general, occupied more than 50% of the tumor area. Individually, parenchymal cells showed strong atypia, expressed by nuclear hyperchromatism and cellular pleomorphism, while unusual giant tumor cells were relatively frequent findings (Figure 5a). Also, mitotic activity was abundant, with the presence of typical and atypical mitosis figures. The infiltration of deep muscle planes is also quite evident; often, the tumor cells exhibited strong dissociation and were arranged in thin strands like the “Indian row”. Areas of perineural and lymphovascular invasion (formation of neoplastic cell emboli) were eventually observed in only two cases (Figure 5b). The massive infiltration of the hypodermic adipose panicle by neoplastic cells was also shown to be a frequent morphological finding. It was possible to evidence areas of neoformation of irregular capillary vessels, many of them hyperemic, both on the periphery of the tumor and inside the solid sheets of neoplastic cells. The inflammatory infiltrates present, albeit in mild to moderate intensity, were composed of lymphocytes and histiocytes, usually concentrated on the tumor margins and polymorphonuclear neutrophils, the latter particularly evident in the perinecrotic areas (Figure 5c). 5-FU group formed solid blocks of neoplastic cells exhibiting moderate atypia, still showing a balance between the number of cells with dense nuclear chromatin (hyperchromatic) and those with finely dispersed chromatin and sometimes with one to two prominent nucleoli. Tumor cells insinuated themselves in the connective tissue and invaded the skeletal striated musculature, sometimes severely dissociating the muscle bundles and adipose panicle and, at other times, separating them into compact and relatively well-preserved blocks or lobes, which denoted less invasive capacity/infiltration of tumor parenchymal cells. The areas of coagulative necrosis were less evident and are presented in the form of thin depicting a pseudolobular architectural aspect. There was also the presence of a peripheral fibrous pseudocapsule, well-marked but thin and discontinuous (Figure 6a). The mitotic activity proved to be infrequent and composed of a typical structure. Areas of intense intratumoral inflammatory infiltrate, rich in lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils were also evident. Moreover, the inflammatory infiltrate was also intense in the marginal tumor areas, especially in the pseudocapsule (peripheral fibrous connective tissue, particularly visible in the superficial portion of the tumors) (Figure 6b). POH/β-CD 50 mg/Kg group presented histological characteristics similar to those evidenced in the 5-FU group, expressed by an architectural arrangement of tumor cells also in irregular pseudolobules, now separated by edematous fibrous connective tissue and rich in inflammatory cells, sometimes separated by necrotic trabeculae tissue. It was observed that the proportion of areas of coagulative necrosis shown in this group was higher than in the 5-FU group (Figure 7a). The invasion pattern of striated skeletal muscle tissue and subcutaneous adipose panicle by tumor cells was also similar to the 5-FU group, with tissue dissociation in dense and compact blocks of muscle fibers and fat cells. Mitotic activity was still marked but seldom atypical mitosis (Figure 7b). POH/β-CD 100 and 200 mg/Kg groups presented similar histological characteristics, characterized by more dense neoplastic proliferation, without lobulation or apparent pseudolobulation, with areas of extensive necrosis both within the tumor mass and in the marginal areas. The inflammatory reaction was limited to tumor margins and perinecrotic areas. The tumoral boundaries were shown to be irregular and strong dissociation and destruction of striated skeletal muscle fibers were observed. Besides, mitotic activity was expressive but with rare atypical (Figure 8). The degree of cytological atypia proved to be highly variable between the various tumors, sometimes milder and sometimes more intense; however, giant cells were rarely seen while morphological signs of the perineural or vascular invasion were not observed. Concerning the histopathological results, the treatment with POH/β-CD at a dose of 50 mg/kg promoted approximately 60% inhibition of tumor growth in mice. The mechanisms of action that determine this biological activity are not yet fully elucidated but there are indications, in the literature, of direct and indirect action by the POH on malignant neoplasms. It has been shown that POH promotes inhibition of the Ras signaling pathway and, consequently, cell proliferation and apoptosis induction in the phase of promoting dermal carcinogenesis. On the other hand, it has recently been reported that POH can block the transition of the phenotype of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells into endothelial cells (mesenchymal-endothelial transition or TMEnd) derived from human multiform glioblastomas. The authors believe that, as EndTM is essential for the development of tumor angiogenesis phenomena, supporting neoplastic nutrition, this inhibitory effect could, indirectly, inhibit tumor progression and recurrence. However, further studies are needed to prove. It should also be noted that the intensity of tumor inhibition of the POH/β-CD (50 mg/kg) was similar to that described by Andrade et al., using free POH in a dose 4 times greater (200 mg/kg). These data suggest that the technological strategy of complexing this monoterpene into β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes (POH/β-CD) not only solves the problems related to the volatility of the compound but also increases its efficiency as an antitumor agent, as it allows obtaining similar results at much lower doses. This increase in the pharmacological activity of bioactive compounds after inclusion into cyclodextrin complexes is well defined in the literature and supports the results obtained in our study. Besides, the groups treated with 5-FU and POH/β-CD (50 mg/kg) presented distinct morphological characteristics compared to others. The lower degree of tumor necrosis, less mitotic activity and better definition of tumor borders, sometimes showing areas of peritumoral fibrosis. The mitotic index provides evidence about tumor proliferative activity; the formation of areas of necrosis is often associated with cell proliferation so intense and rapid that neovascularization does not occur with the speed necessary to provide nutrition to tumor cells and, thus, suggesting high proliferative activity; lymphocytic peritumoral fibrosis provide evidence about the interaction between tumor and host tissues. Thus, it is possible to speculate that such findings, almost not observed in the other groups, could be related to a less aggressive biological behavior of tumors treated with 5-FU and POH/β-CD (50 mg/kg). Tumor proliferation was analyzed using in situ immunostaining of the Ki67 antigen. This protein is expressed in the cell nucleus in all phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2 and M), is widely used as an indicator of cell proliferation and even tumor prognosis. In this sense, tumors with high proliferative indices (strongly positive for the Ki67 antigen) would show more aggressive biological behavior, the opposite being true for those with lower proliferative indices (showing weak positivity for Ki67). Immunostaining for Ki67 antigen was observed in all analyzed samples but the immunostained cells varied significantly between specimens. Although immunohistochemical positivity has been evidenced mainly in the cell nucleus, in many cases the cytoplasmic/membranous expression of this antigen has also been identified in tumor cells. However, only nuclear immunostaining was considered for quantitative analysis of the proliferative tumor index. The distinct morphological characteristics suggest a less aggressive tumor behavior in the groups treated with 5-FU and POH/β-CD (50 mg/kg) (Figure 9). In the present study, immunostaining for the Ki67 antigen was evidenced predominantly in the nuclei, corroborating the classic pattern of immunoexpression described in previous studies with sarcoma 180. However, eventually and surprisingly, focal areas of cytoplasmic/membranous immunostaining of this antigen were also found. This atypical marking pattern for the Ki67 antigen has been described previously but the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and its real clinical significance remain unclear. It has been suggested that this pattern of immunostaining would occur for three possible reasons: (i) an alleged cross-reaction with other cytoplasmic antigens similar to the histone ki67 nuclear protein; (ii) technical artefacts and (iii) possible relocation of the Ki67 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during the cell cycle. In our work, nuclear immunoexpression of the Ki67 antigen was reduced in the groups treated with 5-FU and POH/β-CD (50 mg/Kg) compared to the group treated with the vehicle. These data suggest a significant reduction of cycling cells (in proliferation) and seem to agree with the results obtained in both macroscopic analyses of the inhibition of neoplastic growth and in the study of the histological characteristics of experimental tumors. On the other hand, the mechanisms that determine these results have yet to be investigated, as they could result both from the possible blockage of the cell cycle and from the increase in death due to apoptosis of cycling cells. It is important to note that, since the areas of coagulative necrosis were much less extensive in these two groups (5FU and POH/β-CD (50 mg/Kg), it is possible that speculation that the smallest tumor growth by inducing a higher rate of necrosis is unlikely. Thus, further studies are needed in order to elucidate this issue.\\', \"ref_21:Both P450s—CYP260A1 and CYP264B1—have shown their versatilities in oxidizing sesquiterpenes. All of the four structural classes of sesquiterpenes employed as substrates (Scheme 1) were converted either by one or by both of the enzymes. This indicates that the active sites of the P450s form cavities large or flexible enough for the binding of these structurally diverse sesquiterpenes. Sesquiterpenes possessing oxygen-containing functional groups (Scheme 2, compounds 1, 6, and 16) serve as substrates for CYP260A1, whereas the corresponding hydrocarbons are not converted. Thus, this enzyme is likely to bind the substrates through hydrogen bonds. Its oxidation reactions show high promiscuity, producing several products in similar amounts (compounds 7–10 from 6, compounds 17–20 from 16) by oxidizing each substrate at different positions. Wildtype CYP260A1 therefore seems a rather poor candidate for selective sesquiterpene oxidation. However, it does hydroxylate sesquiterpenes at chemically inert positions (compound 1 at C-4, compound 16 at C-9). In analogy to previous studies with CYP106A2,[32] rational mutagenesis of CYP260A1 could be conducted to increase its selectivity. The conversions of 1, 6, and 16 demonstrated in this study represent suitable model reactions for this purpose. CYP264B1 converts all of the employed substances, whether they are oxygenated or non-oxygenated hydrocarbons, except for (+)-3(15)-cedren-4-ol (16). The enzyme\\'s active site seems to be governed by hydrophobic residues, able to bind unpolar sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. However, the ketones 1 and 6 are converted more efficiently and more selectively than their non-oxidized parent sesquiterpenes 4 and 12. This might be explained by hydrogen-bond-directed preorientation of the substrate ketones in the active site. A computational model of 1 bound to CYP264B1 shows binding of the carbonyl group to the backbone amide of Met286.[30] CYP264B1 shows high selectivities for C-5 hydroxylation of the humulanes 6 and 12 as well as for b-caryophyllene (14). Therefore, neither the 8-keto function nor the greater flexibility of humulanes in relation to the related caryophyllanes have an effect on the regioselectivity of the hydroxylation. Eremophilane-type substrates are converted into a multitude of products, mainly hydroxylated at C-13 (compounds 3 and 5). The occurrence of some side products, which has likewise been observed for the physiological substrate (+)-eremophilene,[27] is probably due to reactions taking place in the E. coli whole-cell catalyst. CYP264B1-mediated in vitro hydroxylations of 1 and 4 have been shown to produce only one and four side products, respectively. [30] Thus, CYP264B1 is a selective sesquiterpene oxidase, which is able to functionalize a broad range of substrate structures. In general, sesquiterpene olefins of every hydrocarbon skeleton type should be considered as substrates for CYP264B1. Taken together, both P450s—CYP260A1 and CYP264B1 should be considered for oxidation studies of further sesquiterpene classes. Whereas wild-type CYP264B1 is selective for allylic hydroxylations, CYP260A1 needs to be engineered to perform reactions with higher selectivities.Most of the bacterial P450s that have been functionally investigated and found to oxidize sesquiterpenes are contained in biosynthetic clusters of different species,[33–38] including S. cellulosum Soce56, close to TPS genes.[27] Sesquiterpene-oxidizing P450s that are not clustered with TPS genes include CYP109B1, which performs the commercially attractive conversion of 4 into 1, [39] CYP102A1 (P450m<sup>3</sup> ) and CYP154E1, which both oxidize 1 to form 3, 25, and 26 (Scheme 4), and the cyanobacterial CYP110 family.[40] CYP110E1 hydroxylates 6 to various products, although yielding mainly 27 and 28 (Scheme 5).[41] Compounds 1 and 6 are the most widely studied sesquiterpenes in terms of bacterial P450-mediated selective oxidations. The existing choice of tools, however, covers only a few oxidation positions of model substrates 1 and 6. In this study we provide a new product—(4S)-hydroxynootkatone (2)—through hydroxylation of the chemically inert C-4 of 1. We also provide another way to access the primary (+)-nootkatone alcohol 3. Previous studies have shown only allylic hydroxylation products 3 and 26 and the epoxide 25 (Scheme 4).[42–44] Oxidation of 6 leads even to a greater variety of described products. Here, we contribute a new selective hydroxylation by CYP264B1 to yield 5-hydroxyzerumbone (11) and the multiply oxidized CYP260A1 products 7–10 (Scheme 5). The side products of the CYP260A1- and CYP264B1-catalyzed reactions include new and unidentified structures. Further development. Oxidized eremophilane- and humulane-type sesquiterpenes have been shown to exhibit various pharmaceutically interesting activities. Compounds 3 and 11 are inhibitors of NO production in interferon- and lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells.[45–46] Compound 3 and other oxidized derivatives of (+)-nootkatone (1) inhibit proliferation in human cancer cell lines A549 and HL-60.[47] The oxidized zerumbone (6) products 7–10 are structurally close to (9E)-humulene-2,3;6,7-diepoxide (<Scheme 3, 24), a promising anti-acetylcholinesterase agent for the treatment of Alzheimer\\'s disease.[28] Compounds 7–10 could thus be tested for similar functions. Generally, the introduction of functional groups by P450s paves the way for further derivatizations. Selectively oxidized sesquiterpenes might serve as lead structures for the development of compound libraries for screening for biological activities. Another important field of application for oxidized sesquiterpenes is that of flavors and fragrances. Introducing an alcohol or keto function significantly alters the olfactory properties of natural terpene hydrocarbons and artificial sesquiterpene-like ketones. [48] Selectively oxidized sesquiterpenes could thus serve for structure–odor relationship studies.[49]\", \"ref_22:Differences in the relative emissions of (E)-beta-ocimene and (E, E)-alpha-farnesene from accession Wassilewskija (Ws), a high-(E)-beta-ocimene emitter, and accession Columbia (Col-0), a trace-(E)-beta-ocimene emitter, were attributed to allelic variation of two closely related, tandem-duplicated terpene synthase genes, TPS02 and TPS03. The Ws genome contains a functional allele of TPS02 but not of TPS03, while the opposite is the case for Col-0. Recombinant proteins of the functional Ws TPS02 and Col-0 TPS03 genes both showed (E)-beta-ocimene and (E, E)-alpha-farnesene synthase activities. However, differential subcellular compartmentalization of the two enzymes in plastids and the cytosol was found to be responsible for the ecotype-specific differences in (E)-beta-ocimene/(E, E)-alpha-farnesene emission. Expression of the functional TPS02 and TPS03 alleles is induced in leaves by elicitor and insect treatment and occurs constitutively in floral tissues. Our studies show that both pseudogenization in the TPS family and subcellular segregation of functional TPS enzymes control the variation and plasticity of induced volatile emissions in wild plant species.Heterologous protein expression and purification of Ws TPS02 and Col-0 TPS03 in Escherichia coli The pET101-TOPO plasmids containing Ws TPS02 or Col-0 TPS03 cDNA were transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 competent cells (Invitrogen) for recombinant protein expression. Transformed cells were incubated in 500-mL cultures, started with an overnight culture, at 18C until an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 was reached. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside followed by additional incubation for 16 h at 18C. Cells were extracted and the TPS proteins were partially purified on 0.5-mL nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose columns (Qiagen) as described by Tholl et al. (2005) and according to the manufacturer\\'s protocol. Following desalting into assay buffer (10 mM 3-N-morpholino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% [v/v] glycerol), fractions with the highest enzyme activity were used for determination of enzyme kinetic parameters. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976) using reagents obtained from Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as the calibration standard. The specific amount of TPS protein in the active fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE separation of the partially purified protein and quantitative comparison of the intensity of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained TPS protein band with those of bovine serum albumin standards. TPS enzyme assay and kinetic characterization For qualitative analysis of TPS enzyme products via solid-phase microextraction, enzyme assays were performed in screw-capped 10-mL glass vials in a total volume of 250 mL containing 10 mL (TPS02) or 150 mL (TPS03) of partially purified enzyme, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM NaWO4, 0.1 mM NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 60 mM GPP or FPP. The assay was incubated in the presence of a polydimethylsiloxane fiber at 30C for 10 min prior to volatile analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described above. For enzyme characterization, assays were carried out for 5 min (TPS03 with FPP) or 20 min in 50-mL reaction volumes with 0.35 to 4.5 mg of partially purified Ws TPS02 or Col-0 TPS03 enzyme under the same buffer conditions described above. Reaction products were extracted with 300 mL of hexane, and total radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. For evaluation of the Km values for GPP and FPP, five different concentrations of [1-3 H]GPP (35.2 MBq mmol1 ) and [1-3 H]FPP (35.2 MBq mmol1 ) were applied. Assays were conducted in three replicates, and apparent Km values were determined by Hanes plot analysis using the Hyper 1.01 program (J.S. Easterby, University of Liverpool). To determine a possible activation of the TPS enzymes by K+ ions, assays were performed with 5 mM [1-3 H]GPP or [1-3 H]FPP in the presence or absence of 50 mM KCl. Construction and analysis of TPS02 and TPS03 promoter-GUS reporter gene fusions A 2.1-kb promoter fragment of Ws TPS02 was isolated from genomic DNA of Ws via PCR using the forward primer P44, containing a HindIII site, and the reverse primer P45, containing the TPS02 start codon and a BamHI site. The PCR product was inserted into the HindIII and BamHI cloning sites of the uidA (GUS) gene-containing binary vector pDW137 (Blazquez et al., 1997) according to Chen et al. (2004). A 1.8-kb Col-0 TPS03 promoter-GUS fusion construct was obtained accordingly using primers P46 and P47. Transformation of the Ws TPS02 and Col-0 TPS03 promoter-fusion constructs into Ws and Col-0 plants, respectively, selection of transformed lines, and GUS enzyme assays were conducted as described previously (Chen et al., 2003b, 2004). At least four independent transformed lines were analyzed. For histochemical analysis of insect-induced GUS activity, P. xylostella larvae were allowed to feed for 24 h. Coronalon-induced GUS activity was determined after 24 h of treatment. Construction of Ws TPS02- and Col-0 TPS03-GFP reporter fusions and subcellular localization A 105-bp fragment encoding a 35-amino acid N-terminal peptide of Ws TPS02 was amplified by PCR with primers P48, carrying a NcoI site, and P49, which contains a SpeI site, and cloned into pCR-TOPO4 (Invitrogen). The fragment was cut out of the vector with NcoI and SpeI and subsequently cloned downstream of a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in the vector pCAMBIA 1302 (Hajdukiewicz et al., 1994) to generate a C-terminal fusion to mGFP5 (Siemering et al., 1996). The same procedure was applied to clone a 150-bp fragment encoding a 50-amino acid N-terminal peptide of the Col-0 TPS03 protein using primers P50 and P51 for initial PCR amplification. Following confirmation of error-free constructs by sequencing, constructs were transformed in A. tumefaciens, and Ws and Col-0 plants were transformed as described above. Transgenic plants were screened on agar plates for hygromycin resistance, and genomic insertion of the corresponding fusion constructs was confirmed by genomic PCR. Two-week-old plantlets of at least four independent lines were used for observation by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a HeNe laser. Tissue autofluorescence was excited at 458 nm and GFP fluorescence at 488 nm. Band pass was set to 500 to 550 nm, and long pass was set to 560 nm. Bright-field images were acquired with the differential interference contrast channel. Images were processed from optical sections taken along the optical axis and projected into one image using the Zeiss LSM Image Browser 3.2.0. Phylogenetic analysis Amino acid sequence alignment of plant TPS proteins was produced with ClustalW (Lasergene 8) and exported as a Nexus file. Phylogenetic analysis of the data set was conducted using maximum parsimony in PAUP* (Swofford, 2002). Maximum parsimony analyses were conducted using heuristic tree searches with tree bisection-reconnection branch swapping and 1,000 random addition sequence replicates. Support for the clades was obtained by performing bootstrap (Felsenstein, 1985) searches with 1,000 replicates and 10 random sequence replicates. Trees were compiled using TreeGraph2 (Stover and Muller, 2010). Statistical analysis Correlations of induced volatile emissions were determined with a Pearson correlation hypothesis test using the SAS program. The deduced amino acid sequences of cited TPS genes from gymnosperms and angiosperms can be found in the GenBank database with the following accession numbers: Arabidopsis multiproduct monoterpene synthase (AtTPS24, At3g25810), NP_001031651; Arabidopsis 1,8-cineole synthase (AtTPS23 and AtTPS24, At3g25820 and At3g25830), NP_189212; Arabidopsis myrcene/(E)-b-ocimene synthase (AtTPS10, At2g24210), NP_179998; Malus domestica a-farnesene synthase, AAS01424; Pyrus communis a-farnesene synthase, ABC25002; Lotus japonicus (E)-b-ocimene synthase, AAT86042; Cucumis sativus (E,E)-a-farnesene synthase, AAU05951; Antirrhinum majus (E)-bocimene synthase, AAO42614; Pinus taeda a-farnesene synthase, AAO61226; Picea abies (E,E)-a-farnesene synthase, AAS47697; Actinidia deliciosa (E,E)-afarnesene/(E)-b-ocimene synthase, ACO40485.\", \"ref_23:The diterpene cyclase ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) from Arabidopsis thaliana is a class II terpenoid cyclase that initiates the cyclization of the substrate, (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), by protonation of the C14,C15 double bond to form a tertiary carbocation, thereby triggering a cascade of carbon–carbon bond forming reactions that ultimately yield the bicyclic product ent-copalyl diphosphate. This comprises the first committed step in the biosynthesis of gibberellins, ubiquitous phytohormones that function in plant growth and development. The active site of CPS plays a critical role as a template in this reaction, since the highly flexible C20-isoprenoid substrate must be fixed in a specific conformation to direct carbon–carbon bond formation with structural and stereochemical precision. While Mg2+ is required for optimal catalytic activity, this metal ion does not participate directly in the chemistry of catalysis. Instead, Mg2+ is believed to anchor the position of the substrate diphosphate group to help chaperone the substrate binding conformation. The general acid responsible for substrate protonation is the \\'middle\\' aspartic acid residue in the DXDD amino acid sequence motif that characterizes a class II terpenoid cyclase. This motif has diverged to VXDC in the related oxidosqualene cyclases, in which the aspartic acid protonates the oxirane ring of the substrate to generate the initial carbocation. Neither general acid motif is to be confused with the \\'DDXXD\\' motif in which the first and sometimes the last aspartate residue coordinate to metal ions in the active site of a class I terpenoid cyclase. While carbon–carbon bond forming chemistry similarly proceeds through multiple carbocation intermediates in class I cyclase reactions, initial carbocation formation is achieved by the metal-dependent ionization of the substrate diphosphate group to generate an allylic carbocation. Thus, class I and class II diterpene cyclases utilize the same substrate, GGPP, but they initiate carbocation formation at opposite ends of this substrate. The evolution of alternative cyclase classes reflects the evolution of alternative regiochemical strategies for carbocation generation in a common substrate.Four crystal structures of class II terpenoid cyclases have been reported to date: the C30-triterpene cyclases squalene–hopene cyclase and oxidosqualene cyclase at 2.0 Å and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively, and the C20-diterpene cyclases abietadiene synthase (a bifunctional class I and class II cyclase) and CPS at 2.3 Å and 2.25 Å resolution, respectively. Each of these cyclases exhibits the characteristic αβγ domain architecture predicted in an elegant bioinformatics study. Common structure–function relationships include the DXDD (or VXDC) general acid motif positioned at the \\'bottom\\' of a hydrophobic active site cleft at the interface of the β and γ domains. This cleft is complementary to the nonpolar portion of the isoprenoid substrate; additional polar channels leading to the general acid motif could be implicated in proton transfer during catalysis. Given that the protonation of a carbon–carbon double bond (C = C) typically requires a strong acid such as H3O+ (pKa = −1.7), it is curious as to how the aspartic acid general acid in the active site of a class II terpenoid cyclase can provide a sufficiently acidic proton to efficiently protonate a C = C bond. The environment of the aspartic acid presumably modulates its pKa from ~4 measured for the free aspartic acid side chain to a value comparable to that measured for H3O+ to ensure an appropriately strong acid function in the active site. Here, we report the 1.55 Å-resolution crystal structure of CPS complexed with (S)-15-aza-14,15-dihydrogeranylgeranyl thiolodiphosphate (1), which mimics the tertiary carbocation formed upon protonation of the C14,C15 double bond of substrate GGPP. The structure of this complex prepared in the presence of Mg2+ ion clarifies various aspects of the previously-reported structure at 2.25 Å-resolution, including a well-defined position for the diphosphate group and tertiary ammonium cation of 1. Additionally, the 1.55 Å-resolution structure provides an unparalleled view of solvent structure in the active site of a class II terpenoid cyclase. Intriguingly, hydrogen bonded water molecules appear to form \\'proton wires\\' that link general acid D379 with bulk solvent through secondary channels distinct from the main entrance to the active site cavity. These proton wires define possible trajectories for regenerating the active form of the general acid during catalysis. The results of site-directed mutagenesis support the proposed roles for active site residues in substrate binding and catalysis.\", \\'ref_24:The topic is Synthesis and affinity assays of pentacyclic triterpene-sialylglycopeptide conjugates with hemagglutinin for anti-influenza activity. Four pentacyclic triterpenes, namely ursolic acid (UA, ursane type), betulinic acid (BA, lupane type), oleanolic acid (OA, oleanane type), and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA, oleanane type) were selected as ligands (Figure 1). We assembled four oligosaccharide-carrying pentacyclic triterpene conjugates and evaluated their influenza activities by testing their affinity with HA. Here, 10 g of SGP was obtained from 20 kg of egg yolk powder using a method described in the literature. First, alkyne-labeled N-glycan was prepared (Scheme 1). SGP was then thoroughly digested with pronase to remove its peptide portion, leaving asparagine (Asn)-linked N-glycans (SCT-Asn). The process was monitored through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with an ultraviolet detector. The retention time (tR) of SCT-Asn was 13.8 min, and it was well separated from the SGP peak (tR = 21.7 min) under the same chromatographic conditions. After the digestion was complete, the residue was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Sephadex G-50) and lyophilized to obtain SCT-Asn (yield = 73.4%). The identity of SCT-Asn was confirmed through electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis. To prepare SCT-Asn-alkyne, the obtained SCT-Asn was dissolved in a mixed solvent of water and dimethylformamide (DMF; 1/1 v/v). Next, the N-(4-pentynoyloxy)-succinimide synthesized in the previous step was added, followed by triethylamine. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 12 h. The residue was subjected to Sephadex G-25 for purification and lyophilized to obtain SCT-Asn-alkyne as a white solid (yield = 56.7%). The identity of SCT-Asn-alkyne was confirmed through ESI-MS analysis. Second, azido-functionalized derivatives of pentacyclic triterpenes (ursolic acid-N3, betulinic acid-N3, oleanolic acid-N3, and glycyrrhetinic acid-N3) were synthesized through the esterification of C-28 or C-30 carboxylic acid with the azide group of Bromo-PEG5-azide in yields ranging from 67.6% to 76.6% (Scheme 2; the structures of pentacyclic triterpene-N3 are available in Supplementary File, Figure S1). The four compounds were confirmed through thin-layer chromatography (TLC), ESI-MS, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Finally, the target SCT-Asn-pentacyclic triterpene conjugates were synthesized, as displayed in Scheme 3. The conjugation of SCT-Asn-alkyne and pentacyclic triterpene-azide was achieved through the Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC). A solution of the alkyne and azide in THF/H2O (3/2 v/v) was stirred with CuSO4, sodium ascorbate, and a copper ligand, tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine (TBTA), at room temperature. The residue was purified through column chromatography to obtain SCT-Asn-UA, SCT-Asn-BA, SCT-Asn-OA, and SCT-Asn-GA in yields ranging from 14.9% to 29.5% (the structures of SCT-Asn-pentacyclic triterpene are available in Supplementary File, Figure S2).SPR assay showed a certain effectiveness in determining the in vitro anti-influenza virus activity of biomolecules. Many studies have used SPR assay and other tests, such as the time-of-addition experiment, HA inhibition assay, molecular docking analysis, etc., to confirm the target and mechanism. Biomolecules with SA residues exhibit certain anti-influenza virus activity. These biomolecules target HA. Therefore, when we investigated the anti-influenza virus activity of the compounds, we first tested its affinity with HA and determined its anti-influenza virus potential. The results could provide guidance for subsequent pharmacological experiments. In this study, we performed SPR assay of four synthesized conjugates with two types of HA, namely H1N1 (A/WSN/1933) and H5N1(A/Hong Kong/483/97), obtained from commercial sources. The affinity of conjugates for HA was measured though SPR and expressed using the thermodynamic dissociation constant (KD). HA was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 chip by using an amine coupling approach. Conjugates at concentrations of 1.562–100 µM were injected, and the responses were measured. A Langmuir 1:1 binding model was fit using Biacore evaluation software (GE Healthcare) to determine the binding affinity. Table 1 shows the results of SPR assay (sensorgrams of SPR assay; see Figures S3 and S4 in Supplementary File). The results revealed that the parent SGP exhibited no affinity with HA, whereas SCT-Asn exhibited enhanced affinity with KD values of 29.04 and 75.46 μM for H1N1 and H5N1, respectively. The polypeptide portion of SGP weakens the interaction between SA residues and HA. The results of binding to H1N1 proteins revealed that among the four pentacyclic triterpenes, OA exhibited the best affinity, with a KD value of 31.14 μM, whereas BA exhibited no affinity. The affinity of UA and GA was marginally inferior, with KD values of 136.70 and 584.00 µM, respectively. For H5N1, OA again exhibited the best affinity, with a KD value of 47.78 µM, but the KD value of GA, UA and BA exhibited no significant affinity. When the pentacyclic triterpene was linked to SCT-Asn, three conjugates (all except for SCT-Asn-UA) exhibited enhanced affinity with H1N1. Among them, SCT-Asn–BA exhibited the best affinity, with a KD value of 6.89 µM (Figure 2). SCT-Asn-OA and SCT-Asn-GA exhibited the next best KD values of 11.24 and 16.35 µM, respectively. The interaction between SA and HA was weak, indicating that oligosaccharides and pentacyclic triterpene moieties could enhance this affinity. Additionally, the affinity of the four conjugates to H5N1 was enhanced; the most active conjugate was SCT-Asn-OA, with a KD value of 9.10 µM (Figure 2), followed by SCT-Asn-GA, with a KD value of 13.24 µM. Although the affinity of the other two conjugates also improved, their KD value exceeded 100 µM. Typically, the affinity of most of the conjugates to HA was higher than that of the parent oligosaccharides and pentacyclic triterpenes. Furthermore, the conjugates exhibited dose-dependent responses, which appeared not to follow specific rules. The fine structures of various pentacyclic triterpenes probably formed various bonds with HA, thus exhibiting various affinities. Notably, the tested conjugates exhibited a binding behavior distinct from that of pentacyclic triterpenes (UA, BA, OA, and GA). The pentacyclic triterpenes exhibited rapid association and dissociation with HA, whereas the conjugates exhibited slow association and dissociation with HA, as evident from the lower association rate constant (Ka) and dissociation rate constant (Kd) values. The interaction of conjugates with HA indicated that the conjugates could form stable complexes with HA, with low KD values, thus improving antiviral activity against influenza virus. This result is consistent with that of a previous report.\\', \\'ref_25:Plant Material. One-year-old P. amabilis saplings were obtained from the Camellia Forest nursery.

To a suspension of NaH (528.0 mg, 60% dispersion in mineral oil, 13.2 mmol) in dry THF (30 ml) was added ethyl acetoacetate (1.5 ml, 11.8 mmol) dropwise at 0°C. After 10 min, n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexane, 7.9 ml, 12.6 mmol) was added slowly over 5 min. It was stirred for an additional 10 min at 0°C, as (2Z)-1-bromo-2-fluoro-3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-2,6,10-triene (1.2 g, 4.0 mmol) was added. After 15 min, the TLC analysis showed that the reaction was complete and HCl (3 M, 6 ml) was added. Water (50 ml) was added, and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with Et2O (3 × 50 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with water (2 × 100 ml) and saturated NaCl solution (1 × 100 ml) and then dried over Na2SO4. The removal of the solvent gave the crude product, and purification by CC using PE/EA (10:1) as the eluting solvent gave (6Z,10E)-6-fluoro-7,11,15-trimethyl-3-oxohexadeca-6,10,14-trienoic acid, ethyl ester (0.8 g, 2.3 mmol, 57%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 600 MHz) of (6Z,10E)-6-fluoro-7,11,15-trimethyl-3-oxohexadeca-6,10,14-trienoic acid, ethyl ester: 1.26 (t, 3H, J = 7.1 Hz, CH3), 1.58 (m, 9H, CH3), 1.66 (d, 3H, J = 1.3 Hz, CH3), 1.92 to 2.07 (m, 8H, CH2), 2.51 (dt, 2H, J = 22.1, 7.4 Hz, CH2), 2.72 (t, 2H, J = 7.7 Hz, CH2), 3.42 (s, 2H, CH2), 4.18 (q, 2H, J = 7.1 Hz, CH2), 5.08 (m, 2H, vinyl H).The torsional sampling method, Monte Carlo multiple minimum, and the OPLS_2005 force field were used in Macromodel 9.9.223 software to conduct conformational searches, applying an energy window of 21 kJ/mol. Conformers with more than 1% population underwent reoptimization at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level, incorporating the IEFPCM solvent model for acetonitrile. The ECD spectra were derived from TDDFT calculations, maintaining consistency in the functional, basis set, and solvent model used for energy optimization. Last, the Boltzmann-averaged ECD spectra for compound 1 were generated using SpecDis1.62.Crystallization was performed using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals of PcTS1 were grown under 0.2 M trilithium citrate and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 at 4°C with Mg2+ and 2F-GGPP. These crystals were harvested for data collection at 100 K. All data were collected at SSRF and BL10U2, processed with HKL2000. For phase determination of PcTS1, molecular replacement was adopted using the structure of TS from Eleutherobia rubra CWA1 (PDB ID: 7S5L; 40% identity) as a starting model. The molecular replacement solution was outstanding, and automatic model building was performed with PHENIX. Additional model building was done manually with Coot and refined with PHENIX. The final model of PcTS1 containing residues 5 to 411 was refined to a 3.5 Å resolution with no ligands shown, as the occupancy of Mg2+ and 2F-GGPP is low; thus, the electron densities are notably weak. The statistics of the data collection and model refinement are summarized in table S10.With PcTS1 in hand, we have the opportunity to deeply investigate the missing catalytic mechanisms of the formation of the biflorane scaffold. We first proposed two possible cyclization cascades of PcTS1 (fig. S6). Initially, GGPP is isomerized to geranyllinalyl diphosphate (GLPP) or 2Z-GGPP within the enzyme’s pocket, resulting in the formation of a 2Z double bond, which is crucial for the subsequent cyclization steps. This isomerization step is consistent with mechanisms observed in other TSs, such as CpPS and EcTPS1. In Pathway I, a 1,10-cyclization is followed by either a 1,3-hydride shift [previous hypothesis; ] or two 1,2-hydride shifts, leading to a 1,6-ring closure. This is then followed by another set of hydride shifts (either a 1,3-hydride shift or two 1,2-hydride shifts) to form intermediate carbocation, culminating in deprotonation. Conversely, in Pathway II, the process begins with a 1,6-cyclization, followed by a 1,10 cyclization (fig. S6). We first investigated the isomerization hypothesis pathway for the formation of the 2Z double bond. GGPP, GLPP, and 2Z-GGPP were chemically synthesized (fig. S7) and incubated with the purified PcTS1 (fig. S8) in vitro. The results revealed that both GGPP and GLPP yielded the same compound 1 (Fig. 3A). However, PcTS1 failed to cyclize 2Z-GGPP into compound 1, in contrast to the mechanism of MicA, which can accept both GLPP and 2Z-GGPP as the substrate to produce the 2Z form eunicellane compound microeunicellene. The incapacity of PcTS1 to recognize 2Z-GGPP as a substrate might be attributed to its inability to initiate carbocation formation by removing the pyrophosphate group within the catalytic center of PcTS1. Alternatively, 2Z-GGPP might not even enter the enzyme pocket because of unsure reasons that need to be further investigated and exceed the scope of this research. To demonstrate the multiple hydride transfer process, we synthesized 1,1-D2-GGPP (Fig. 3B and fig. S7) and incubated it with PcTS1. The deuterated product, compound 4, was isolated, purified, and characterized using GC-MS and NMR techniques. GC-MS analysis revealed the molecular formula of compound 4 as C20H30D2 (m/z 274.3), indicating an increase of 2 Da compared to the unlabeled compound 1, which corresponds to the replacement of two hydrogen atoms with deuterated atoms in 1,1-D2-GGPP (fig. S47). In addition, the NMR comparison between compounds 1 and 4 showed that both share the same biflorane core structure. Also, the absence of correlations for H-6 to C-6 and H-11 to C-11 in the heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of compound 4 (Fig. 3C) indicated the presence of deuterium at the C-6 and C-11 positions. This was also confirmed by the lack of the 1H NMR signals for H-6 and H-11 found in compound 1 and the notion that the signal for H-17 in 4 exhibits a singlet instead of a doublet in 1. In addition, the carbon signals for C-6 and C-11 in compound 4 showed a decrease in intensity, consistent with deuterium isotope effects, confirming the presence of deuterium at the C-6 and C-11 positions. Thus, compound 4 was identified as the 6,11-dideuterated derivative of compound 1. These findings collectively support the proposed cyclization cascades and confirm the occurrence of a 1,3-hydride shift following the 1,10-cyclization and two 1,2-hydride shifts after the 1,6-ring closure in Pathway I or two 1,2-hydride shifts following the 1,6-cyclization and a 1,3-hydride shift after the 1,10-ring closure in Pathway II. To differentiate the two proposed pathways and provide direct evidence which cyclization process occurs first, we synthesized 6F-GGPP (fig. S9), an excellent substrate for elucidating cyclization pathways. The fluorine atom at C-6, because of its strong electron-withdrawing effect, inhibits 1,6-cyclization in the catalytic pathway of PcTS1. This inhibition effect is expected to result in the formation of monocyclic products in Pathway I or acyclic products in Pathway II (see hypothesized quenching products in fig. S10). Incubation of 6F-GGPP with PcTS1 followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed several different peaks (Fig. 3D), including the main product compound 5, with a retention time of 25.2 min. This difference in retention time, compared to compound 1 (tR = 29.7 min), indicates the formation of the anticipated intermediate shunt fluorinated product. Compound 5 was purified from a 300-ml scale in vitro reaction and characterized using GC-MS and 1D and 2D NMR techniques. Its molecular formula was determined as C20H31F (m/z 290.4) by GC-MS, indicating five degrees of unsaturation. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra revealed the presence of four methyl groups, six methylene groups, two methine groups, and four double bonds. These features account for four degrees of unsaturation, suggesting that the molecule is monocyclic. Considering the hypothesized shunt products (fig. S10), the analysis of the typical terminal double bond signals and correlations in the 1H-1H COSY and HMBC spectra not only enabled the determination of two double bonds to be Δ1,2 and Δ3,20 but also facilitated the establishment of the planar structure of compound 5. The E configuration of the C1/C2 double bond was determined by a large coupling constant (3JH-1,H-2 = 16.3 Hz). The nuclear Overhauser effect correlation between H-10 and H-18 established the trans relative configurations of C-10 and C-11. The isolation and identification of compound 5 confirmed the cyclization order as a 1,10-cyclization followed by a 1,6-ring closure (Fig. 3E). The structural basis of the cyclization mechanism was studied by determining the crystal structure of PcTS1. Followed by several failure crystallization efforts with full-length PcTS1, we expressed and purified a truncated form of PcTS1, PcTS1ΔN1–5, which lacks the first five N-terminal amino acids with catalytic activity unaffected. For clarity, we refer to \\'PcTS1ΔN1–5\\' as \\'PcTS1,\\' unless stated otherwise. We performed crystallization experiments with the purified PcTS1 (fig. S8), enabling us to determine the 3D structure of the apo form of PcTS1 as a monomer at a 3.5 Å resolution (PDB ID: 8ZWZ; Fig. 4A and table S10) using the cembrene A synthase from Eleutherobia rubra (PDB ID: 7S5L) as a template. The crystal structure of apo PcTS1, akin to the previously described coral TS protein ErTC-2 (Fig. 4B), exhibits the characteristic class I TS α-helical fold. However, it distinguishes itself with the absence of one helix (K), the elongation of two helices (H and M), and the presence of an additional helix (O) because of an insertion. Notably, PcTS1 shares a remarkable structural resemblance with microbial TS-like proteins, in concert with the similarities observed in ErTC-2. PcTS1 exhibits an overall structure that closely aligns with the tFold-generated model of PcTS1 (Fig. 4C), with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.94 Å for the Cα atoms. However, the tFold-based model of PcTS1 features two additional helices (K and P) and helix M in the apo form of PcTS1 is split into two helices (M and M1), underscoring the significance of protein crystal structure analysis for achieving more precise outcomes. When compared with TS sequences from a range of species within other coral genera (fig. S12), it is apparent that PcTS1’s aspartate-rich sequence (D96D97XXE100), the NSE(D)/DTE sequence (N257DLYS261YQRD265), and the RY motif (R345Y346) are conserved across coral species (Fig. 4D). To further accurately determine the catalytic information inside the center, we performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on the basis of the crystal structure. We subsequently used QM/MM calculations to gain catalytic insights. In the QM/MM calculation (Fig. 5A), the A+ is observed to bind within a hydrophobic active pocket comprising aromatic residues (F64, F93, F221, W335, and H339), hydrophobic residues (I59, A189, G216, V218, I254, V343, and P344), and polar residues (C253 and S338). Notably, A+ exhibits a unique structural feature wherein C1, C10, and C11 form a triangular \\'protonated cyclopropane\\' configuration, which has been mentioned in previous research. The C1-to-C10 and C1-to-C11 distances are 1.62 and 1.89 Å, respectively (fig. S13), which are longer than the typical C─C single bond but shorter than the van der Waals radius of two carbon atoms, suggesting pronounced hyperconjugation effects between the C1─C10 σ bond and the C11’s vacant p-orbital. In addition, A+ is stabilized by a cation-π interaction between positively charged C11 and Δ14,15, with a distance of 3.07 Å (fig. S13). The hydrogen (Ha) on C1 resides above the p-orbital of C11, with a Ha-C11 distance of 1.82 Å, thus facilitating the subsequent 1,3-hydride shift (fig. S13). Following Ha’s shift from C1 to C11, an allylic carbocation forms, leaving C1 and C3 positively charged. Then, C1 moves toward C6 to initiate a 1,6-cyclization, resulting in the formation of B+. Concurrently, the distance between C11 and Δ14,15 elongates to 3.34 Å, as the positive charge shifts to C7 (fig. S13). C7+ is stabilized by the nearby aromatic residue F221, with an interaction energy of 4.4 kcal/mol. Herein, the hydride shift and cyclization represent a concerted but asynchronous process, requiring only a slight energy barrier of 1.8 kcal/mol while releasing a substantial heat of 23.5 kcal/mol (fig. S13), making it both kinetically and thermodynamically very feasible. Subsequently, the hydrogen atom (Hb) on C6 transfers to C7, triggering a hybridization transition in C6 from sp3 (tetrahedral) to sp2 (planar) (fig. S14). Simultaneously, as the hydride migrates, C6 gradually approaches the double bond Δ2,3, facilitating the formation of a C1-C2-C6 three-membered ring motif, ultimately yielding the C+ state with a positive charge localized at C3. This C+ is stabilized by a cation-π interaction with F93, exhibiting an interaction energy of 4.2 kcal/mol. This concerted hydride transfer and cyclization process requires overcoming a slight energy barrier of 2.4 kcal/mol, accompanied by a substantial heat release of 14.6 kcal/mol (fig. S14), presumably stemming from the notion that the enhanced stability achieved the reformation of the three-membered ring motif. It should be noted that C3 bears the most positive charge, while C6 also exhibits a partial charge accumulation, with respective atomic charges of 0.27 and 0.17. As a result, the hydrogen atom (Hc) located at C1 could transfer to C6, thereby destroying the three-membered ring and constructing the 6,6-bicyclic structure, resulting in a D+ state (Fig. 5). The above transition step needs overcoming a barrier of 11.9 kcal/mol, accompanied by a heat release of 9.9 kcal/mol (fig. S15). In D+, the vacant p-orbital of C1 conjugates with Δ2,3, distributing the positive charge between C1 and C3. While considering an alternative pathway for the formation of D+, a direct transition from B+ to D+ via 1,3-hydride migration (from C1 to C6) seems plausible. However, the hydrogen atoms on C1 and C6 are positioned on opposing sides of the rigid ring in C+, thereby hindering a direct transfer to C6 because of unfavorable spatial orientation, which is also consistent with above isotope labeling studies that proved that two 1,2-hydride shifts occur during the cyclization process (fig. S14). In D+, the hydrogen (Hd) positioned on C16 is in close proximity to the oxygen atom (O1) of OPP, with a distance of 1.96 Å (fig. S16); accordingly, the basic O1 abstracts Hd, generating the ultimate product 1 (Fig. 5), indicating that the leaving pyrophosphate group is the final deprotonation base. This transformation involves a tiny barrier of 1.3 kcal/mol and exhibits a notable exothermicity of 20.5 kcal/mol (fig. S16).\", \\'ref_27:Isoalantolactone (4) and alantolactone (5) were isolated by column chromatography from the methanolic extract of dried Inula helenium roots. From 160 g of methanolic extract, 1.5 g of 4 (0.9% yield) and 4.5 g of 5 (2.8% yield) were obtained as colorless crystalline solids. Compound 6 was obtained from a Saussurea lappa root extract following the procedure described in the literature. From 50 g of S. lappa root extract, 2.3 g of 6 (5.0% yield) were obtained as a colorless crystalline solid. After successfully isolating the starting materials, we applied the synthesizing routes shown in Schemes 1 and 2 to obtain pertyolides A, B, and C. Compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized in four steps. The photochemical addition of acetaldehyde to the starting sesquiterpene lactones yields the 1,4-dicarbonyl derivatives 7 (68% yield) and 8 (54% yield) with a C17 skeleton following the procedure described in the literature. When the photochemical addition was carried out with alantolactone, the epoxide byproduct 9 (Figure 1) was also generated along with the desired 1,4-dicarbonyl derivative 8. It is unclear how the photoaddition would lead to the formation of the epoxide from the endocyclic double bond. The authors believe that two parallel reactions take place: the desired photochemical addition of acetaldehyde at position C-13 and also an undesired epoxidation which may be due to an interaction between the singlet oxygen generated and the already mentioned double bond. Different trials were conducted modifying the reaction time to optimize the yield of the desired product, and the best results were obtained with 2 h of reaction time. NOESY experiments were carried out to determine the relative configuration of the C-11 center of derivatives 7 and 8 (Figure 1), as well as the orientation of the epoxide group of 9. The C3 chain was determined to be β-oriented due to the positive NOE effects between H-8 and H-7 and H-11. On the other hand, the epoxy group was determined to be β-oriented due to the positive NOE correlations between H-6 and H-4, H-7 and H-13. The absolute configuration of the molecules has been established from the known absolute configuration of the precursors. After obtaining 7 and 8, the new carbonyl group at position 16 must be masked to enable the later regioselective hydroxylation at position 11. The procedures described in our previous work were applied to mask the keto group. In the first instance, the keto group was treated with 2-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane (MED) as a protective agent, to obtain the corresponding cyclic ketal. However, after several attempts using different Lewis acids (p-TsOH, aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) and boron trifluoride-ethyl etherate (BF3·C4H10O), as well as different temperature levels and reaction times, the target cyclic ketal was never obtained. A number of trials were also conducted by applying a Dean–Stark trap procedure, where ethylene glycol was used as the protective agent, but in most cases the starting material remained unchanged or degradation products were observed. In order to mask the carbonyl group and obtain the desired acyclic ketals (10 and 11), a different strategy was devised that consisted in the protection of the keto group by means of trimethyl orthoformate (TMOF) in the presence of anhydrous MeOH and catalytic amounts of p-TsOH. As a result, the acyclic ketal derivatives 10 and 11 were obtained at 58% and 65% yields, respectively. Once the ketal derivatives (10 and 11) had been obtained, hydroxylation at the α position of the lactone group was carried out by peroxidation followed by a reduction step in one pot according to the procedure described in the literature. The treatment of the derivative 10 yielded a mixture of the desired hydroxylated ketal 12 (63%) and 1 (22%), while the derivative 11 yielded 62% of 13 and 18% of 2. The attempts to purify the hydroxylated ketals 12 and 13 were conducted by means of column chromatography and HPLC. However, they could not be successfully separated and instead, 9:1 mixtures with their respective pertyolide as minor constituent was obtained. It is well-known that ketals are labile in acidic media and can be easily deprotected through hydrolysis or transketalization. Some reports suggest that acyclic acetals can be alternatively deprotected in aqueous solution without the presence of an acid. Accordingly, during the workup of the reaction, the crude is treated with Sörensen buffer (an aqueous solution of Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4, pH 7.2). The authors believe that this step is responsible for the partial hydrolysis of the derivatives 12 and 13. The complete deprotection of the ketals 12 and 13 was performed by transketalization in an acetone:H2O 95:5 mixture with catalytic amounts of p-TsOH according to the procedure described in the literature. This procedure produced pertyolide A (1) and B (2) both as crystalline solids in 89% and 95% yields, respectively. The NMR and the spectroscopy data of the synthesized 1 and 2 match those reported in the bibliography.Pertyolide C (3) was synthesized through six steps as shown in Scheme 2. According to the procedure described in our previous work,14 was synthesized from 6 in three steps. Then, an allylic oxidation step using selenium dioxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) yielded the dihydroxylated ketal 15 in 59%. The compound 15 was then deprotected via transketalization under the same conditions used for pertyolides A and B, and a 93% yield of the compound 16 was obtained. The last step of the synthetic pathway consists of the esterification of the hydroxy group at C-3 using isovaleric acid with complete Walden inversion of the alcohol stereocenter. This can be done in one pot through the Mitsunobu reaction. The treatment of the compound 16 under the conditions described in the literature, i.e., with isovaleric acid, diisopropylazodicarboxylate (DIAD), and triphenylphosphine (PPh3), produced pertyolide C (3) as a colorless oil at 43% yield. The relative configuration of the C-3 center was determined by the positive NOE correlations between H-3 and H-1 and H-5, which proved that the isovalerate group introduced is β-oriented. The absolute configuration of the molecule has been established from the known absolute configuration of the precursors. The NMR data and the spectroscopy data of the synthesized pertyolide C match those reported in the bibliography. The phytotoxic activities of the new compounds were evaluated against etiolated wheat coleoptiles following the procedure developed by our research group. The usage of etiolated wheat coleoptiles is a common practice in the field of allelopathy in order to evaluate phytotoxic activity. This is a rapid and sensitive procedure that can be applied to a wide range of bioactive substances, such as plant growth regulators, herbicides, or mycotoxins. The recorded data on the activity profiles of each molecule (Figure 2) were fitted to a sigmoidal dose–response curve to determine their IC50 values (Table 1) and establish a comparison of the bioactivities of the synthesized molecules against that of the commercial herbicide Logran (active ingredients 59.4% terbutryn and 0.6% triasulfuron), which had been used as the positive control. The ketals 10, 12, 11, and 13 were not evaluated due to their instability in aqueous media. All of the starting materials, dehydrocostuslactone (6), isoalantolactone (4), and alantolactone (5) exhibited strong inhibition levels (>90%), comparable to that of the commercial herbicide Logran, when used at concentrations above 100 μM, although with a significant drop in their activity at lower concentrations. In the case of the eudesmanolide C17-sesquiterpenoids synthesized, we could observe substantially different behaviors, where isoalantolactone derivatives, i.e., both the ketone derivative 7 and pertyolide A (1) did not show any relevant activity even at the highest concentrations tested. On the contrary, their isomers, i.e., compound 8 and pertyolide B (2), presented strong inhibitory activity at concentrations above 300 μM with a significant drop at lower concentrations. The profiles of the compounds 2 and 8 reveal that even after eliminating the α-methylene-butyrolactone system, the molecules still have a strong inhibitory activity at concentrations above 300 μM with a drop of their activity below that concentration level. By contrast, a huge drop of the activity can be observed in compounds 1 and 7 compared to that of compound 4. This may suggest that, in the specific case of the isoalantolactone skeleton, the α-methylene-butyrolactone moiety is important for the phytotoxic activity of isoalantolactone or that the modifications that take place in the C2 appended skeleton prevent the molecules from reaching their site of action. When establishing a correlation between a chemical structure and a bioactivity there are many properties, such as steric and electronic aspects, lipophilicity, or aqueous solubility, that play an essential role in the capability of the molecules to reach their site of action inside a living organism and exert their biological effects. It is possible that the structural modifications of isoalantolactone alter these properties, hindering the capability of the molecule to interact with its biological target. In the case of the synthesized guaianolide C17-sesquiterpenoids, our previous work demonstrates that similarly to alantolactone, the elimination of the α-methylene-butyrolactone system only caused a slight drop in the phytotoxic activity of the molecules. Another slight drop of the activity by both compounds 15 and 16 was observed when the second hydroxy group was introduced at position C-3. However, pertyolide C (3) experienced a large improvement of its activity after the hydroxy group at position C-3 had been modified by adding the isovalerate group. In fact, pertyolide C (3) exhibited the strongest inhibitory profile of all the molecules and at every concentration level within the range tested (1000 μM to 10 μM) with an outstanding IC50 value of 12 μM, which is lower than that of dehydrocostuslactone (6) (170 μM) or the commercial herbicide Logran (38 μM). According to the results obtained from the bioassays with etiolated wheat coleoptiles, some of the target C17-sesquiterpenoids and intermediates synthesized present similar or even superior activity to the original sesquiterpene lactone containing the α-methylene-butyrolactone system. No clear trend could be observed to support that the elimination of the said moiety has a negative impact on the phytotoxic activity of the molecules. This led us to think that the phytotoxic activity of C17-sesquiterpenoids may take place at a different site of action in the molecule and that they may have a specific mechanism of action other than the Michael addition reactions that are commonly associated with the activity of sesquiterpene lactones. In conclusion, we have applied a previously designed general synthetic pathway that has allowed the synthesis, for the first time, of three natural C17-sesquiterpenoids, pertyolides A (1), B (2), and C (3) with 29%, 26%, and 4% overall yields through two key steps: the photochemical addition of acetaldehyde to the α-methylene-butyrolactone system of the sesquiterpene lactone and a hydroxylation at the α position of the lactone group. Furthermore, the phytotoxic activities of the target molecules, as well as their intermediates, were evaluated against etiolated wheat coleoptiles to determine their profile of activity and their IC50 values. Pertyolide C (3) presented the highest inhibitory activity with an outstanding IC50 value of 12 μM. The data obtained from the bioassays suggest that the α-methylene-butyrolactone moiety is not essential for these types of molecules to present phytotoxic properties.\\', \\'ref_28:In the title compound, C19H30O3Si, both rings adopt a half-boat conformation. Overall, the molecule approximates a U-shape as the cyclo-2-ene-1,4-dione and butyl-dimethyl-sil-yloxy substituents lie to the same side of the central cyclo-hexene ring; the methyl substituent lies to the other side of the molecule. In the crystal, linear supramolecular chains along the b axis are sustained by C-H⋯O interactions.For a general description of the synthesis of higher terpenoids using the Diels–Alder reaction, see: Brocksom et al.

Its molecular formula, C16H25NO, was established by HREIMS (m/z 247.1927, [M]+, calcd. 247.1936), indicating five degrees of unsaturation (Figures S1 and S2). The diagnostic 1H and 13C NMR resonances, as well as coupling constants of the connected protons (Table 1, Figures S3 and S4), indicated the presence of one trisubstituted double bond (δH 5.58, s, δC 130.4, CH; δC 136.5, qC) and four methyl groups (δH 0.97 (3H, d, Me-12); 0.90 (3H, d, Me-13); 1.40 (3H, s, Me-14); 1.42 (3H, t, Me-15)). The typical 13C NMR signal of sp3 quaternary carbon (δC 63.3, qC), bearing in mind the odd molecular weight of 1, suggested the presence of an isocyano group (−NC group). The above functionalities account for three out of the five degrees of unsaturation, suggesting a bicyclic ring system in 1. The above structural features were reminiscent of the co-occurring molecule 2, as well as a previously reported axinisothiocyanate J (20) which was isolated from the sponge Axinyssa sp. Detailed comparison of the NMR data revealed that 1 should possess the same cadinane ring system as 20. The only significant difference of these two compounds was the presence of an isocyano group at C-10 in 1 instead of the isothiocyano group (−NCS group) in 20. According to this, the 13C NMR data of C-1, C-9, and C-10 in 1 were upfield shifted (δC 45.9, CH, Δδ = −1.0 ppm; δC 39.4, CH2, Δδ = −1.0 ppm; δC 63.3, qC, Δδ = −2.7 ppm), respectively, compared with those in 20. Further 2D NMR spectra, including COSY, HSQC, and HMBC (Figures S5–S7), allowed the unambiguous determination of the planar structure of compound 1 (Figure 2). The relative configuration of 1 was deduced by NOESY spectra (Figure 2 and Figure S8). The NOE correlation between H-5 (δH 5.58, s) and H-11 (δH 2.14, m) indicated the Z-geometry of Δ5,6. The correlations of H-1 (δH 1.96, m) with Me-15 (δH 1.42, t) and H-7 (δH 1.64, m) indicated that these protons were on the same side of the molecule and were tentatively assigned to be α-oriented. Furthermore, the obvious NOE correlation between Me-15 and H-2b (1.94, m), and between Me-14 (1.40, s) and H-2a (1.69, m) suggested the α-orientation of Me-14. Therefore, the structure of compound 1 was determined as shown in Figure 1, which was further confirmed by its similar NMR data to those of axinisothiocyanate J (20) based on a biogenetic consideration. In fact, compound 1 was identified as a C-10 epimer of a known isocyanosesquiterpene alcohol, which was first isolated from the nudibranch Phyllidia pustulosa.Compound 16 was isolated as an optically active colorless oil, +19 (c 0.1, CHCl3). Its molecular formula was determined as C22H37N2O4Cl by HRESIMS (m/z 429.2522 [M+H]+, calcd. 429.2515), indicating five degrees of unsaturation (Figure S9). The IR spectrum (Figure S10) of 16 showed absorptions at νmax 1665 cm−1 and 3440 cm−1, indicating the presence of the amide carbonyl and hydroxy groups, respectively. The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra of 16 displayed 22 carbon signals, including five sp3 methyls, six sp3 methylenes, five sp3 methines, four sp3 quaternary carbons, and two sp2 methines. The spectroscopic data (Table 1, Figures S11 and S12) showed highly similarity to those of co-occurring related known compounds 18 and 19, indicating that 16 is also a kalihinane-type diterpenoid. In fact, they differed from each other only by the substitution at C-5 position of the kalihinane ring. Bearing in mind the two additional protons present in its molecular formula in comparison to 19, a −NHCHO group (δH 8.10 s, δC 167.6, CH) should be attached to the C-5 of compound 16. Intriguingly, resonances for both formamides were observed as a plethora of signals between δH 8.0 and 8.3. These included eight signals arising from the four isomeric arrangements possible for the two formamides at C-5 and C-10. Detailed analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR spectra, including 1H-1H COSY, HSQC, and HMBC (Figures S13–S15), allowed the establishment of the planar structure of 16 (Figure 2), the same as a known compound named bisformamidokalihinol A, which was obtained from the hydrolysis of kalihinol A with acetic acid. The relative configuration of 16 was also determined to be the same as co-occurring compounds 17–19 by careful interpretation of its NOESY spectrum with the clear NOE correlations of H-1/H-7, H-5/H-6/H3-20, and H3-19/NHCHO at C-5 (Figure 2 and Figure S16). Since the absolute configuration of 17 has been previously determined by total synthesis, from a biogenetic point of view, the absolute configuration of compound 16 was tentatively assigned as 1S,4R,5R,6S,7S,10S,11R,14S.It is worth noting that compound 5 was previously isolated from the Hainan sponge Axinyssa variabilis, and its absolute configuration was determined by a combination of ROESY experiment and time dependent density functional theory-electronic circular dichroism (TDDFT-ECD) calculation. In this work, we obtained a single crystal of 5, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on a suitable crystal of 5 by employing Ga Kα radiation (λ = 1.34139 Å) with small Flack parameter 0.02 (16) allowed not only the unambiguous definition of the planar structure as illustrated in Figure 3, but also the revision of its absolute configuration from 4S,5R,10S to 4R,5S,10S. Aware of the potent cytotoxicity exhibited by marine nitrogenous terpenoids, we performed in vitro biological evaluation of all the isolated metabolites on several tumor cell lines. The results (Table 2) showed that compounds 8, 10, and 11 exhibited strong cytotoxicity against human cancer cell line SNU-398 with IC50 values of 0.50, 2.15, and 0.50 μM, respectively. In addition, compound 8 also displayed broad cytotoxicity against the other three cancer cell lines, including A549, HT-29, and Capan-1, with IC50 values of 8.60, 3.35, and 1.98 μM, respectively. It is interesting to note that, although only three compounds showed cytotoxicity, they are all of the same bisabolane type. Therefore, a preliminary structure-activity relationship could be addressed, that is, the bisbolane skeleton might be good for activity, while regarding the inactive compounds 7 and 9, the terminal olefin or the formamide group might be harmful for activity. More diverse bisabolanes should be discovered and tested for cytotoxicity to support our proposal.\\', \\'ref_30:Photosynthesis relies on the light-harvesting capabilities of chlorophylls, which mainly absorb light energy in the ultraviolet (Soret absorption band) and far-red/near-infrared (Qy absorption band) regions of the solar spectrum. However, chlorophylls are unable to efficiently absorb blue to green light. To bridge this spectral gap, carotenoids are utilized to enhance photosynthetic light-harvesting. Carotenoids can capture blue to green light and transfer that absorbed energy to chlorophylls via singlet-singlet energy transfer. The efficiency of this process depends on the type of carotenoid present in the pigment-protein complexes of photosynthetic organisms. Carbonyl-containing carotenoids are particularly effective at energy transfer, due to the presence of carbonyl groups that are in conjugation with their polyene backbone. However, the molecular mechanisms behind their high efficiency in this energy transfer process are still debated. A detailed understanding of the excited-state dynamics of carbonyl-containing carotenoids will be important for developing highly efficient, energy transfer systems for artificial photosynthesis.The polyene conjugated system of linear carotenoid molecules is often approximated as belonging to the C2h point group symmetry. However, the singlet excited-states of carotenoid show an unusual pattern of the state ordering due to the strong electron–electron interaction of the π-electrons in the conjugation system. When light is absorbed by a carotenoid, the transition from the ground singlet (S0, 11Ag−) state to the second excited singlet (S2, 11Bu+) state is allowed in a one-photon optical transition. On the other hand, the transition from the S0 ground state to the first excited singlet (S1, 21Ag−) state is one-photon forbidden. Moreover, ultrafast time-resolved laser spectroscopy has confirmed the presence of additional excited states designated as intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) and S* excited states. These additional excited states play important roles, respectively, in the light-harvesting and photo-protection, creating a more detailed insight into the generation mechanisms of these eccentric excited states, which are essential to understanding the excited-state dynamics of carotenoids. Especially, the ICT excited state of the carbonyl-containing carotenoid is important because this excited state is stabilized in the polar environment and facilitates the highly efficient singlet–singlet excitation energy transfer from carotenoid to chlorophyll in the light-harvesting systems of diatoms and marine algae. Although there are multiple explanations for the generation mechanisms of the ICT excited state, the ICT state is often attributed to a mixed S1/ICT state due to its strong coupling with the S1 state. Previous studies have investigated ICT excited states from the viewpoint of their dependencies on the solvent, conjugation length, excitation wavelength and substituent groups. In addition, the ultrafast relaxation process after photoexcitation of the geometric isomers of carbonyl-containing carotenoids has also been investigated. However, the number of reports is restricted and reliable data on the integrity of the isomers as well as the isomerization following photoexcitation are sparse. Nonetheless, the isomers of carotenoids hold significant importance in the photosynthetic reaction center (RC), and thus far, the subsequent facts have been definitively established. Carotenoids bound to the RC of purple photosynthetic bacteria adopt a 15-cis configuration of the carotenoid. In the cyanobacterial photosystem I (PSI), there are 22 β-carotenes, of which, 17 are all-trans, 2 are 9-cis, and each one comprises 9,9′-cis, 9,13′-cis, 13-cis, and they act as both light-harvesters and photoprotectors. Thus, the cis isomers of carotenoids are certainly utilized in the primary process of photosynthesis, but the fundamental question of why the cis isomers, rather than the all-trans isomers, are selected, still needs addressing.Another example of an unexplained excited state is the S* state. The shoulder of the transient-absorption band appearing on the high-energy side of the S1 → Sn transition of carotenoids at room temperature has been assigned to the S* state. The S* state generated in carotenoids bound to antenna pigment-protein complexes has been postulated to be the precursor of the triplet excited states of the carotenoids. On the other hand, the S* state generated in carotenoids in organic solvents was claimed, on the basis of pump-deplete-probe spectroscopy, due to the vibrationally hot ground state that is formed by both the S1 → S0 internal conversion, and the impulsive Raman scattering promoted by the pump-pulse irradiation. What is clear is that the origin of the S* state is still under debate, and the exact generation process remains to be clarified.The excited-state dynamics of the cis isomers of peridinin and fucoxanthin, both of which are well-known carbonyl-containing carotenoids, have been investigated. In these studies, it was reported that the cis isomers in polar solvents exhibited transient absorption bands characteristic of the ICT excited state. The shortening of the S1/ICT lifetimes was also reported, compared to the S1 lifetimes in nonpolar solvents. In addition, the cis isomer had a shorter S1 or S1/ICT lifetime than that of the all-trans isomer. It should be noted that the shortening of the S1 lifetimes of the cis isomers has also been observed in carotenoids without carbonyl groups. Previous studies on cis isomers of carotenoids have primarily focused on central-cis isomers, which exhibit a cis-bend at the central portion of the polyene chain. However, there has been insufficient research on terminal-cis isomers and di-cis isomers, and the integrity of the cis-configuration has often not been well established. In order to bridge these knowledge gaps, our research focuses on exploring the isomers of the carbonyl-containing carotenoid found in β-apo-8′-carotenal. Hashimoto et al. have already isolated and identified all the mono-cis and major di-cis isomers of this carotenoid, and their chemical structures can be seen in Figure 1. Using femtosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopy, we have studied the excited-state dynamics of these isomers in both non-polar and polar solvents. We hypothesize that the asymmetry of the molecule and intentional breaking of the C2h symmetry, with the introduction of the cis-bend, may impact the electronic structure of the linear polyene.The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to predict the geometry optimized structures of the isomers of β-apo-8′-carotenal in the ground state and in vacuum using a Gaussian 16W program (Version: 64-bit x86-64, Gaussian Inc., Wallingford, USA). The B3LYP/6-31G (d) basis set was used for the computation.Our results suggest that some cis isomers, such as the 9-, 13-, and 9,13-cis isomers, could be used to achieve highly efficient energy-transfer in photosynthetic light-harvesting because the S1/ICT states produced from these isomers show more pronounced stabilization under a polar environment.\\', \"ref_31:The terpenoids, also called isoprenoids, are one of the largest and most structurally diverse classes of natural products, and play vital roles in almost all life forms [1,2]. In the biosynthesis of terpenoids, the isoprene units (C5) are assembled by polyprenyl transferases to give long chain terpenes such as geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and squalene, which can then be converted into diverse carbon skeletons by the terpenoid synthases (TPSs) [3,4]. Understanding the specificity of TPSs is of great significance to biochemistry, organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry. According to the number of isoprene units (C5) of the substrates, TPSs can be classified into hemiterpenoid (C5), monoterpenoid (C10), sesquiterpenoid (C15), diterpenoid (C20), sesterterpenoid (C25), triterpenoid (C30) and sesquarterpenoid (C35) synthases. Most TPSs have one of two distinct protein folds [5–7], an a fold (class-I) and a bc fold (class-II). For \\'\\'class I\\'\\' enzymes, the reaction is initiated by Mg2<sup>+</sup> -assisted removal of the diphosphate group, e.g., in limonene synthase [8] (Figure 1a and Figure 2a), while for \\'\\'class II\\'\\' enzymes, an acidic residue (normally Asp) initiates protonation of a double bond or an epoxy oxygen, e.g., in squalene-hopene cyclase [9,10] (Figure 1b and Figure 2b). Both reaction types produce carbocation-olefin intermediates that undergo diverse cyclizations (rearrangements), followed by quenching of the carbocations via deprotonation or hydroxylation [5,11,12].Some diterpenoid synthases that have the abc fusion fold can sequentially use both class I and II active sites to catalyze even more complicated reactions, e.g., the abietadiene synthase [13]. Some TPSs are promiscuous, e.g. the baruol synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana converts oxido-squalene into baruol (90%) as well as 22 other minor products [14]. Other TPSs are highly specific, e.g. the human lanosterol synthase generates only lanosterol, which has 7 chiral carbons [15]. Sometimes, even a single mutation in the TPSs can completely alter their product specificity, e.g. the H234S and H234T mutants of the lanosterol synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce 100% protosta-12,24-dien-3b-ol and 100% parkeol, respectively [16]. Crystal structures of TPSs [5,6,8–10,13,15,17–30] provide a basis for understanding reaction mechanisms and specificity. As carbocations are short-lived, trapping the enzyme-bound intermediates is experimentally difficult. Therefore, high level quantum mechanics (QM) [31–35] and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) [36–40] calculations have been performed in order to understand the mechanisms of TPSs. Some in silico predicted catalytic mechanisms have been confirmed by experiments, e.g. a recent kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study on the mechanism of pentalenene synthase confirmed the QM-derived mechanism [41]. Hong et al. studied the catalytic mechanisms of a series of mono-, sesqui- and di-terpenoid synthases using QM methods, which have been summarized in a review article [32].\", \\'ref_32:The cannabis industry has undergone remarkable evolution in recent years. Despite marijuana, cannabis having ≥0.3% (weight/weight) of Δ9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC, see compound 1, Figure 1), being illegal in many parts of the world and stigmatized for decades, many states in the United States (U.S.) have now legalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana-based products. Similarly, there has been an increase in U.S. Federal legislation, with a particular focus on accelerating the pace of research needed to address numerous challenges in the field.−One major contemporary challenge involves the availability of derivatives of Δ9-THC (1, Figure 1), which is the primary active component of marijuana that is associated with intoxication. However, from a therapeutic standpoint, 1 is also the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in the FDA-approved drugs Marinol and Syndros. These drugs are used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy, in addition to loss of appetite and weight loss in patients with HIV/AIDS. Whereas 1 on its own is a Schedule 1 substance, Marinol is a Schedule 3 substance, and Syndros is a Schedule 2 substance.Not surprisingly, analogs of 1 have similarly become highly sought after for both medicinal and nonmedicinal purposes. THC derivatives 2 and 3 provide illustrative examples. Nabilone (2) is sold as a racemate under the trade name Cesamet and is used for the treatment of chronic pain (in Canada). It is also FDA-approved for chemotherapy-induced vomiting or nausea (in the U.S.). A contrasting example is Δ8-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC, 3), a minor constituent of cannabis with a structure similar to 1. Δ8-THC (3) has become commonly available to the public in many states, both with and without marijuana legalization, yet remains non-FDA-approved, unregulated, and generally understudied.The present study focuses on related cannabinoids called hexahydrocannabinols (HHCs). Despite being relatively understudied since the first synthesis by Adams in 1940, these compounds are now becoming increasingly widespread and can be purchased in some states in the U.S. Conflicting views regarding the federal legality of HHCs exist. One perspective is that HHCs are legal as a result of the U.S. 2018 Farm Bill. On the other hand, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has informed us that they consider HHCs of the type described herein Schedule 1 substances.When HHCs are accessed synthetically from Δ9-THC (1) or Δ8-THC (3), two diastereomers can form: (9R)-HHC 4a and (9S)-HHC 4b (Figure 1). The 9R isomer, 4a, is sometimes referred to as the “methyl equatorial” isomer of HHC in the literature, whereas the 9S isomer, 4b, is sometimes referred to as the “methyl axial” isomer. These HHC diastereomers vary based on the stereochemistry at C9. It is expected that different properties and biological effects exist for the two diastereomers. The ratio of isomers 4a and 4b within commercially available HHC varies significantly, as will be discussed further in this Letter, presumably based on the method of production and purification. Most commonly, 4a and 4b are prepared using catalytic hydrogenation,− which yields a mixture of isomers with low selectivity. In addition, fires, runaway reactions, and explosions are well-known dangers associated with catalytic hydrogenation and such dangers can vary based on the conditions employed.− Lastly, trace heavy metals (e.g., Pt or Pd) may remain after catalytic hydrogenation due to leaching or dissolution. The extent to which trace metals remain can vary based on the catalyst employed, the reaction conditions used, as well as the exact purification methods. The presence of residual heavy metals bears significant toxicity concerns.Limited biological studies of HHCs 4a and 4b are available in the literature.− The psychoactive effects of 4a and 4b have been demonstrated in rabbits and nonhuman primates, using either individual isomers or mixtures. With regard to therapeutic potential, studies have shown that HHCs 4a and 4b may be valuable leads for the treatment of colon cancer and ocular hypotony. One recent study shows promising cardiac safety and cytotoxicity profiles for the mixture of HHC isomers using in vitro assays. There is also one report regarding the in vitro binding affinity of (±)-4a in human cannabinoid receptors. Systematic in vitro assay data showing potency or binding affinity of enantioenriched 4a or 4b to the cannabinoid receptors type 1 or 2 (CB1 or CB2), have yet to be published. Of note, cannabinoids that bind to either the CB1 or CB2 receptor may be associated with both adverse effects and therapeutic potential, depending on a variety of factors. Cannabinoids that bind to the CB1 receptor are also commonly associated with intoxicating effects. Individually investigating the biological characteristics of HHC isomers 4a and 4b would provide insight into their therapeutic potential.With the aforementioned considerations, we sought to (a) develop a means to synthesize both isomers of HHC that avoids the use of potentially dangerous catalytic hydrogenation conditions and toxic heavy metals and (b) establish their affinity and activity at human CB1 and CB2 receptors relative to Δ9-THC (1). Here, we report the use of cooperative hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) to convert Δ9-THC (1) and Δ8-THC (3) to HHCs 4a and 4b. In contrast to results obtained by using catalytic hydrogenation, 4a is formed as the major product using the HAT protocol. Additionally, we demonstrate via biological investigation that 4a and 4b possess significantly different binding affinities and potency, with 4a exhibiting similar activity compared with Δ9-THC (1). Finally, we examine the certificates of analyses for >60 commercially available HHC products, which show wide variability in HHC isomer ratios. These studies are expected to prompt further scientific investigation of HHCs, and also underscore the importance of performing such synthetic and biochemical studies as new cannabinoids inevitably emerge.To initiate our studies, we investigated the reduction of Δ9-THC (1) to afford HHCs 4a and 4b (see Table 1). We first attempted catalytic hydrogenation conditions, since literature data did not consistently report diastereoselectivities or yields. We began with the use of PtO2, which Adams had demonstrated in the 1940s for the reduction of 1. This gave roughly equimolar amounts of 4a and 4b (entry 1 in Table 1). Similar results were seen when Pt/C was used (entry 2 in Table 1). Although the use of Rh/C proved to be ineffective (entry 3 in Table 1), hydrogenation using Pd/C delivered 4a and 4b in a ratio of 1 to 3.9, respectively (entry 4 in Table 1). We then examined homogeneous hydrogenation conditions that were not known for the reduction of 1 in the literature. The use of Ir catalyst (Crabtree’s catalyst) proved less effective (entry 5 in Table 1), while Rh catalyst (Wilkinson’s catalyst) was unsuccessful (entry 6 in Table 1). The reduction with diimide 5 also proved unproductive (entry 7 in Table 1). Stoichiometric metal hydride conditions gave low yields (entry 8 in Table 1). Lastly, we evaluated HAT conditions, which are attractive due to the avoidance of pyrophoric reagents and high levels of thermodynamically controlled diastereoselectivity. Such conditions had not been reported for the reduction of 1. The Fe-based protocol reported by West was especially attractive, as the necessary reagents are commercially available and iron is considered a metal of minimal concern. Employment of the West conditions gave good diastereoselectivity (entry 9 in Table 1) but a low yield. By increasing the loading of reagents and adding them portionwise over two additions, the combined yield of 4a and 4b increased to 74%, with a 4a:4b ratio of 9.5:1 (entry 10 in Table 1). It is notable that the HAT conditions provide the highest selectivity and favor the formation of isomer 4a. In consideration of the results described in the subsequent section pertaining to biological assays, the observed preference for 4a proved to be a fortuitous result. We also examined the HAT reduction of the Δ9-THC (1) isomer Δ8-THC (3). As shown in Scheme 1, treatment of 3 under our previously optimized conditions afforded HHCs 4a and 4b in 77% yield. Of note, the 4a:4b ratio was 11.0 to 1, respectively, which reflects comparable selectivity to the diastereoselectivity observed when Δ9-THC (1) is employed. These results show that either THC isomer (i.e., 1 or 3) can be used in the reduction.In order to rationalize the diastereoselectivity in the HAT reduction of 1 and 3, we considered the relative energies of 4a and 4b. A 1989 study by Reggio and co-workers suggested that 4a is energetically favorable, but computations using higher levels of theory now accessible have not been performed. As such, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations using ωB97X-D (6-31G*) for 4a-Me and 4b-Me, which are the simplified structures (i.e., methyl in place of pentyl) shown in Figure 2. Following conformational searching, the lowest ground-state energies were compared. Of note, 4a-Me was found to be thermodynamically favored by 1.42 kcal/mol. This difference in energy corresponds to a diastereomeric ratio (dr) of ∼10:1, which is consistent with our experimental observations. In accordance with general mechanistic considerations for HAT reductions, thermodynamic control is presumably operative in the reductions of 1 or 3 to favor formation of the product bearing an equatorial methyl group (i.e., 4a, analogous to computed structure 4a-Me).\\', \\'ref_33:Terpenoids are a large family of structurally diverse natural products, which are produced by the collaboration of terpene cyclases (TCs) and tailoring enzymes. Remarkably, TCs play a central role in terpenoid biosynthesis, as they convert the linear polyprenyl pyrophosphates to polycyclic backbones with multi-stereogenic centers via carbocation-initiated cascade reactions. According to the initial carbocation formation, TCs are generally divided into two classes.1 Class I TCs form an allylic cation through the release of the pyrophosphate group, whereas class II enzymes yield a tertiary carbocation by protonating the C–C double bond or the epoxide moiety without the departure of the pyrophosphate group.<sup>1</sup> In addition to the two classes of canonical TCs, a new family of UbiA-type TCs was recently identified from both bacteria and fungi, which initiate the terpene cyclization via release of the pyrophosphate group in the same way as that of E-mail: tghao@jnu.edu.cn, thudan@jnu.edu.cn †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Supplementary methods, tables and figures. See DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1039/d2qo00408a> ‡These authors contributed equally to this work. type I TCs. The UbiA superfamily proteins are a well-known group of membrane-bound prenyltransferases involved in primary and secondary metabolism.<sup>2</sup> In 2011, two UbiA superfamily proteins (PtmT1 and PtnT1) from Streptomyces platensis MA7327 and MA7339 were first reported to act as terpene cyclases to form ent-atiserene diterpene.3 Later, a third UbiAtype TC from Aspergillus fumigatus (FmaTC) was identified to be responsible for the production of β-trans-bergamotene.4 To date, 11 UbiA-type TCs have been characterized, including eight enzymes from bacteria and three enzymes from fungi (Fig. 1).3–<sup>6</sup> Multiple sequence alignment of these enzymes shows that UbiA-type TCs have two conserved motifs NXXX (G/A)XXXD (motif I) and DXXXD (motif II), which are predicted to be required to remove the pyrophosphate group.<sup>5</sup> Despite the great progress, the catalytic scope and catalytic mechanisms of UbiA-type TCs remain largely unknown. It is thus of great significance to discover more UbiA-type TCs so as to broaden the knowledge on this special group of TCs. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new subgroup of UbiA-type TCs from fungi, which contain a motif I of NQXXXXXXXED, rather than NXXX(G/A)XXXD from the known UbiA-type TCs.Further investigation into the functional significance of motif I in the novel UbiA-type terpene cyclases was conducted through site-directed mutagenesis. Key residues within motif I were mutated to assess their impact on enzyme activity. Kinetic analysis was performed to measure the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of both wild-type and mutant enzymes, revealing differences in their ability to generate sesquiterpenes. Structural modeling of the cyclases was carried out using homology-based approaches, and molecular docking simulations were employed to predict the binding mode of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) within the active site. These computational studies provided mechanistic insights into how the distinct motif I influences the cyclization reaction and the formation of the bisabolyl cation intermediate.\\', \\'ref_34:The enormous number of terpene structures found in nature can be attributed to the enzyme class of terpene synthases (TPS). These catalysts accept the ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates geranyl diphosphate (GPP), (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) as substrates and convert them into the basic monoterpene, sesquiterpene and diterpene carbon skeletons, respectively [1]. The product diversity of terpene synthases can be explained by their electrophilic reaction mechanism, which involves the formation of reactive carbocationic intermediates. These carbocations can undergo different cyclizations, hydride shifts and other rearrangements until the reaction is terminated by deprotonation or water addition [1–3]. We previously characterized two sesquiterpene synthases TPS4 and TPS10 that are involved in volatile terpene formation in maize (Zea mays) [4–6]. While TPS4 is mainly expressed in maize husk leaves and forms the major constitutive volatiles emitted from this tissue, TPS10 contributes to the herbivory-induced sesquiterpene production in maize seedlings. TPS4 has been reported to produce a mixture of more than 22 sesquiterpenes, with 7-epi-sesquithujene and β-bisabolene being the major compounds [4]. The reaction catalyzed by TPS4 starts with the Mg2+-dependent ionization of the substrate (E,E)-FPP (Figure 1). The resulting (E,E)-farnesyl cation is then isomerized to the (Z,E)-isomer, presumably via the formation of nerolidyl diphosphate as an intermediate. A subsequent C6-C1 ring closure (numbering as for FPP) leads to the bisabolyl cation, which can be deprotonated to form the neutral product β-bisabolene. Alternatively, the bisabolyl cation can undergo a C6-C7 hydride shift and a C2-C6 ring closure. Deprotonation of the resulting sesquithujyl cation leads to the second major product 7-epi-sesquithujene [4]. TPS10, with 57% amino acid similarity to TPS4, produces seven sesquiterpenes that are also formed as minor products by TPS4 [7]. However, the major TPS10 products, (E)-α-bergamotene and (E)-β-farnesene, are derived by a C2-C7 ring closure of the bisabolyl cation and subsequent deprotonation, or by deprotonation of the initially produced farnesyl cation, respectively [7]. In general, multiple product formation by terpene synthases is assumed to be the result of variable starting conformations of the substrate and alternative conformational changes of reaction intermediates guided by the active site contour [8–10]. For example, structure modeling, in silico substrate docking, and site-directed mutagenesis of active site residues suggested that individual intermediates of the reaction sequence of TPS4 can be bound with alternative conformations in the active site cavity [10].Although many terpene synthases have been characterized during the last three decades and several studies have addressed the role of single amino acids in TPS catalysis, a precise prediction of product specificities based on TPS amino acid sequences is not yet possible [1]. Thus, the analysis of structure-function relationships in TPS enzymes is an important research goal that helps to understand the evolution of terpene synthases and may allow the rational design of TPS enzymes with novel functions in the future. In the present study, we used structure modeling and sequence comparisons to identify amino acids that determine the different product specificities of maize TPS4 and TPS10. Active site residues and neighboring amino acids were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting mutant proteins were assayed in vitro, and product profiles were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data showed that active site amino acids in combination with a few adjacent residues determine the product specificities of TPS4 and TPS10.\\', \"ref_35:Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS) catalyzes the production of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), an isoprenoid intermediate required for protein geranylgeranylation. This post-translational modification attaches the geranylgeranyl group from GGPP to the C-terminal cysteine residue of target proteins, which include members of the Ras small GTPase superfamily, such as Rho and Rac proteins. By facilitating the localization of these proteins to cellular membranes, geranylgeranylation is critical for signal transduction pathways that regulate cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. Notably, dysregulation of Rho and Rac small GTPases has been implicated in various stages of cancer development and progression. As a result, inhibiting GGPPS to downregulate protein geranylgeranylation has emerged as a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Recent drug discovery efforts have identified thienopyrimidine-based bisphosphonates as a novel class of GGPPS inhibitors. These compounds have shown effectiveness in blocking protein prenylation in multiple myeloma cells, leading to apoptosis. In a mouse model, administration of a representative inhibitor resulted in the downregulation of small GTPase geranylgeranylation and a reduction in serum levels of monoclonal immunoglobulins, a biomarker of multiple myeloma disease burden. Additionally, the most potent inhibitors in this series demonstrated no significant toxicity in mice and normal human bone marrow cells compared to untreated controls. Characterized by a thienopyrimidine-derived scaffold with an extended side chain, these inhibitors are more lipophilic than current bisphosphonate drugs, such as risedronate and zoledronate. Notably, the large side chain enhances both tissue targeting and cellular uptake and is thought to promote a tight fit within the GGPPS active site. Optimizing enzyme-inhibitor interactions is critical for improving drug candidate potency, but the precise details of thienopyrimidine bisphosphonate binding remain to be elucidated. An obstacle to characterizing GGPPS-inhibitor interactions is the enzyme’s poor propensity to yield diffraction-quality crystals. Currently, only two crystal structures of wild-type (WT) human GGPPS are available, one resolved at 2.7 Å in complex with GGPP, the product of the enzyme, and the other at 2.2 Å in complex with ibandronate, a clinical bisphosphonate drug targeting the GGPPS paralogue, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. While these structures have provided valuable insights into the general architecture of the enzyme and its feedback inhibition mechanism, they do not capture interactions with more recently discovered nanomolar inhibitors, such as thienopyrimidine bisphosphonates. This challenge may stem from the unique quaternary structure of human GGPPS. Unlike its homologues that form homodimers, dimers of human GGPPS further associate into a homohexamer, creating an overall structure with a \\'three-blade propeller\\' configuration. In contrast, GGPPS predominantly exists as a homodimer in most non-mammalian species, and structures of dimeric homologues have been extensively characterized. Given this difference, we hypothesized that a dimeric form of human GGPPS may be more amenable to crystallization, as it could represent a simpler and potentially more uniform structure than the hexameric WT assembly. With only two active sites as opposed to six, dimers are expected to exhibit reduced conformational diversity arising from inhibitor binding, which may induce local structural changes at each binding site or even trigger a global conformational transition of each monomer. To test our hypothesis, we introduced a site-directed mutation at the dimer-dimer interface of human GGPPS. Key residues involved in inter-dimer interactions were identified (Fig 1A), and a single amino acid substitution replacing Tyr246 with Asp successfully disrupted hexamer formation, thereby creating a mutant protein that exists as a dimer in solution. The potential of this approach was evident, as we routinely obtained crystals of the Y246D mutant protein. However, these crystals exhibited suboptimal diffraction during X-ray analysis, resulting in the highest resolution structure determined at 2.8 Å (PDB ID: 6C56; Fig 1B). This structure revealed an interesting consequence of the hexamer-preventing mutation: increased flexibility of residues around the mutation site led to the formation of a disulfide bond in both subunits of the dimer (Fig 1B). Importantly, the disulfide bonds introduce structural randomness in the α1–α3 insertion region (Fig 1B), likely contributing to the low resolution of the diffraction data. In this study, we engineer double-site mutants of human GGPPS to eliminate the Cys247–Cys205 disulfide bond observed in the Y246D mutant. Enzyme assays confirm that all three mutants—Y246D/C247L (DL), Y246D/C205A (DA), and Y246K/C247L (KL)—retain WT-level catalytic activity. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) demonstrates that inhibitor binding to these mutants is analogous to that for the WT enzyme, underscoring their suitability for screening studies. Notably, the DL mutant exhibits greater thermal stability than the other two mutants, a characteristic often associated with enhanced crystallizability. Indeed, the DL mutant consistently yields diffraction-quality crystals, enabling us to determine its structure at a resolution of 2.1 Å. This represents the highest resolution structure of human GGPPS to date and provides the first glimpse of the enzyme’s interactions with its substrate, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). We also discuss an unexpected crystallographic artefact and its implications for interpreting the structural data.GGPPS plays a crucial role in protein prenylation and is implicated in various diseases, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Given the challenges associated with the structural characterization of this enzyme, protein engineering offers promising strategies to facilitate the rational design and optimization of inhibitors. For example, a dimeric form of GGPPS may provide a simpler system for investigating enzyme-inhibitor interactions. In this study, we generated catalytically active dimeric mutants of GGPPS, which could serve as surrogates for the WT enzyme in drug discovery research.One of these mutants yielded a 2.1 Å resolution crystal structure, leading to the first characterization of IPP binding in human GGPPS. This structure also revealed an unexpected consequence of the engineered mutation—the formation of disulfide bonds between dimer units in the crystal. While increased use of reducing agents during crystallization or further mutagenesis could address this issue, insights from the current mutants highlight the profound impact that even a single amino acid mutation can have on enzyme structure, stability, and dynamics. Ultimately, optimized dimeric forms of GGPPS could serve as valuable molecular tools in therapeutic development, providing a more reliable structural platform for screening and designing novel inhibitors.\", \\'ref_36:The IPK crystalline dimer is consistent with its oligomeric state deduced by gel filtration chromatography (Supplementary Figure 1). The dimer orients around a noncrystallographic two-fold axis. This dyadic axis sits perpendicular to the extended β-sheet spanning the length of the dimer (16 β-strands with 8 β-strands per monomer). Although every AAK family member utilizes a similar dimerization interface, each dimer is unique in that its monomers orient differently with respect to one another. The IPK dimer closely resembles that of UMPK, with the αC helices from each monomer crossing one another at an angle of 190° (2, panel b). In IPK, this interface is comprised of 8 charged hydrogen bonds and 29 noncharged hydrogen bonds with 14 residues participating in van der Waals interactions. The majority of the hydrogen-bonding interactions stitch together three structural motifs: (i) the αC helices of each monomer; (ii) the αD helix of one monomer and the β9−β10 hairpin of the dyad related monomer; and (iii) the 310 helix of one monomer and β5 of its dyadic partner. Hydrophobic interactions between the two monomers include residues from the αC and αD helices, the 310 helix, and the β4, β5, β6, β8, β9, and β10 strands. These residues form an intimate hydrophobic interface further cementing the monomers together and burying a considerable amount of accessible surface area (1869 Å2 of buried surface area per monomer).The structures of IPK in complex with IP and IPP define the secondary structural elements comprising the IP-binding pocket and include the β2−αB glycine-rich loop, the αB helix, the β3−β4 hairpin, the β4−αC loop, the N-terminal section of the αC helix, and the β9−β10 hairpin (4, panel a). The β2−αB loop is one of two conserved glycine-rich loops present throughout the AAK family. It is thought to contribute to charge neutralization in the transition state during phosphoryl transfer. Notably, the orientation of the αB helix is conserved only in the phosphate division of the AAK superfamily (including IPK, FomA, and UMPK). In FomA, the αB helix orders when substrate is present but is otherwise disordered. In contrast, the αB helix in IPK is ordered in both ‘apo’- and IP-bound structures. Of even more limited familial distribution, the β3−β4 hairpin is present only in IPK and NAGK. In NAG-bound NAGK structures, the hairpin often exists in a closed conformation; in contrast, all structures of IPK reveal the motif in an open conformation. Regardless, the hairpin may play a role in shielding the substrate-binding pocket from the surrounding solvent in both enzymes. The branched C5 tail of the substrate resides in a pocket surrounded principally by hydrophobic residues, including Ala63, Phe76, Met79, Phe83, Ile86, Met90, Ile146, and Ile156, (4, panel a). The arrangement of residues within the cavity suggests that transmutation of the isopentenyl binding pocket to accommodate longer hydrocarbon chains may be relatively facile. The phosphate moiety of IP occupies the active site region between three short motifs including His60 and the β2−αB (residues 54−56) and β10−αE (residues 157−159) loops (5, panels a−c). In both monomers, the Nε2 atom of His60 and the N atoms of Gly55 and Gly159 when protonated could stabilize the three nonbridging O atoms on the phosphate of IP through hydrogen bonds (5, panels b−c). In monomer B, Lys6 also interacts with one of these nonbridging O-atoms indirectly through hydrogen-bonding interactions with an intervening water molecule; in monomer A, there is no water molecule to facilitate this interaction.In monomer A, a loop at the β1−αA junction (Gly8−Leu12), residing near the active site, can adopt two distinct substrate-binding conformations based upon refinement of alternative conformations and the observed electron density. In one conformation, the loop lies near the active site β-sulfate ion, while in the other, the loop lies closer to the β2−αB loop (4, panel b). None of the residues in this loop participate in hydrogen-bonding interactions with IP; however, the dual binding conformations are not observed for the ‘apo’ structure, suggesting that loop movement is partially dependent on the presence of substrate. In monomer B, the loop adopts one binding conformation roughly equidistant between the two modes present in monomer A. The crystal structure of IPK with its product bound reveals that IPP adopts two distinct conformers designated conformers A and B (5, panels d−f). These conformers are similar except for the orientation of the β-phosphate group and the adjacent bridging O atom. In conformer A, these two moieties sit closer to the β10−αE loop, while in conformer B, they reside closer to the β2−αB loop (5, panels e−f). In both conformers, a nonbridging O atom of the β-phosphate group hydrogen bonds to the protonated Nε2 atom of His60. A superposition of the two monomers (5, panel d), reveals that His60 sits in a different location in each monomer, which may reflect conformations of this residue that are dynamically accessible as the phosphorylation reaction proceeds. In monomer A only, a water molecule rests between a nonbridging O atom from the α-phosphate of IPP and the carboxylate moiety of Asp160 (5, panel e). This water molecule is also found in substrate-bound structures of FomA kinase (PDBID 3d41), E. coli NAGK (pdbID 1gs5), P. furiosus UMPK (PDBID 2bmu), and E. coli UMPK (pdbID 2bne), and it is stabilized in a similar fashion in each of these structures. Asp160 of IPK is highly conserved among the AAK family and has been suggested to function as an active site base and a central organizing residue.As discussed previously, the β1−αA loop occupies two conformations in monomer A of the IPK−IP complex: one that places it in close proximity to the β2−αB loop, and another that interacts with the β-sulfate ion (4, panel b). In monomer A of the IPK−IPP complex, the latter conformation is the major binding mode observed. The former conformation can also be seen in the electron density, although this binding mode is so subtle that it did not refine well and was not built into the final structure. This minor binding mode may, however, hold some significance, as it places Gly9 of the β1−αA loop in close proximity to the β-phosphate group in conformer B of IPP. The β1−αA loop is often reported to interact with the β- and γ-phosphate groups from ATP analogs; however, there are also examples of this loop interacting with the β-phosphate of the product (in UMPK from E. coli). The catalytically relevant conformer for IPP is most likely conformer B. This hypothesis is supported by three pieces of information: (i) The β1−αA loop, which is thought to play a key role during phosphoryl transfer, accesses a minor binding mode that is in close proximity to the β-phosphate of conformer B; (ii) A superposition of UDP-bound UMPK from E. coli and IPP-bound IPK demonstrates that the phosphate moiety of UDP superimposes with conformer B of IPP; and (iii) The ATPγS/IP/Mg2+ complex structure (discussed below) exhibits clear electron density for a IPPβS molecule bound in a single conformation that superimposes with conformer B of IPP from the IPP-bound structure. Conformer A of IPP may, therefore, represent a post-reaction enzyme−product (EP) complex.When a crystal of IPK was soaked in a stabilizing solution containing IP, Mg2+, and ATPγS, the product IPPβS was observed bound in the active site. This product resembles IPP except one of the nonbridging O atoms on the β-phosphate is clearly replaced with an S atom, as evidenced by the additional electron density associated with the β-thiophosphate. Notably, no electron density for the second product ADP is seen. This is the only structure determined where both substrates, IP and ATPγS, were soaked into the crystal resulting in a catalyzed reaction in the crystal lattice. Interestingly, this structure reveals only one binding mode for IPPβS consistent with the orientation of conformer B in the IPP-bound structure. In both monomers, Gly159 from the β10−αE loop stabilizes the α-phosphate group of IPPβS; the β-thiophosphate group remains in close proximity to His60. However, in monomer B (compared to monomer A), the substrate migrates to a position that shifts away from this residue and resides closer to the β-sulfate ion (3). The intermediate location of the β-phosphate group in monomer B coupled with the inferred heightened dynamics of certain loops within this monomer suggests that the monomer B structure depicts an earlier phase in the transphosphorylation reaction compared to monomer A.As mentioned previously, the tail of the IP substrate is sequestered within a hydrophobic binding pocket (4, panel a). At the back of the pocket, several residues, Ile86, Ile146, and Ile156, can be mutated to smaller amino acids to accommodate the binding of ligands with extended carbon chains (such as GP and FP). With this idea in mind, several point mutants were generated including I86A, I86G, I146A, I146G, and I156A, and most of these were able to convert FP to FPP while the wild-type enzyme lacked an equivalent activity (6). These observations support the idea that mutation to smaller residues widens the cavity to allow for the binding of an extended isoprenoid tail, while mutation to bulkier residues hinders this ability. It was found that several double and triple mutant combinations displayed improved FP to FPP conversion by an order of magnitude compared to the single mutants, providing evidence that a deeper or larger cavity is more effective for FP binding and catalysis (6). It is also reassuring that these mutations are contextually dependent, meaning that mutations at the very back of the active site (at position 83) are not effective unless they are present with mutations closer to the front of the active site (at positions 86, 146, or 156). Modeling of an FP molecule within the active site of IPK suggests that a C15 isoprenyl tail can orient in several different directions without introducing a large number of steric clashes. These various orientations could be explored by mutating the appropriate amino acid side chains (to relieve putative steric clashes) and by utilizing a high-throughput coupled assay to test each mutant for its ability to convert FP to FPP. The coupled kinase/terpene synthase assay (6) is ideal for rapid and qualitative analysis, which is necessary here since a large number of mutants must be screened to explore all possible FP orientations and mutant combinations. Thus far, we have obtained active mutants that were designed to accommodate one putative FP orientation. Crystal structures of FP-bound IPK mutants will assist in the future design of more robust mutants. Finally, exploration of the above mutations in the context of a mesophilic ortholog should afford improvement in kinetic activity for new phosphate-bearing substrates; a more accurate picture of dynamic behavior can be painted for a mesophilic IPK being studied at ambient temperature rather than thermophilic IPK (used here) being studied at ambient temperature.\\', \"ref_37:Among the tested compounds only those with level of the anticancer activity which was close or higher to betulin 1, were selected to the second stage of the study. The compounds 6, 9, 13–14, 16, betulin 1 and cisplatin were evaluated in vitro for antiproliferative activity against human cell lines like adenocarcinoma (A549), prostate (Du-145), melanoma (Hs294T), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and normal mammary gland (MCF-10A). The results of antiproliferative activity of the triterpenes 6, 9, 13–14, 16 against five applied cell lines (A549, Du-145, Hs294T, MCF-7 and MCF-10A) are presented in Table 2.Our studies showed moderate activity of derivatives 6, 13–14, 16 against the tested cell lines. The most active compound was derivative 9 for which the IC50 values are in the range 7.3–83.5 μM. The introduction of the 2-butynoyl group at the C-3 position in compound 9 resulted in an increase of antiproliferative activity in Du-145, Hs294T and MCF-7 cell lines when compared with betulin 1. Figure 2 present the Selectivity Index (SI) calculated for compounds 6, 9, 16 and betulin 1 according to the formula: SI = IC50 for normal mammary gland/IC50 on corresponding tumour cell line. Additionally, triterpene 9 was more selective towards Du-145 (SI= 9.82), Hs294T (SI = 6.76) and MCF-7 (SI = 6.89) cells than the reference compound 1. The obtained results exhibited that carbon-carbon triple bond of carboxyl moiety at the C-3 position is favourable for the antiproliferative activity.Lipinski’s \\'Rule of five\\' and Veber’s criteria are used to assess the similarity of a compound to a drug substance. This is related to the determination of such properties as blood (plasma)-brain partition coefficient permeant (logBBB), lipophilicity (logP), number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors (HBA and HBD) and topological polar surface area (TPSA). The ADME parameters of the newly synthesized triterpenes are detailed in Table 3. The derivatives 5–24 demonstrate the octanol water partition coefficient (logP) in the range 7.67–9.72, which may be evidence of low ability of compounds to cross the cell membranes. As can be seen in the Table 3, the HBA and HBD values of the 3-substituted derivatives are within the preferred range (HBA ≤ 10 and HBD ≤ 5). The number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) and hydrogen bond donors (HBD) of the compounds 5–24 are in the range 0–4.The TPSA values for all compounds are found in the range between 43.38 Å2 and 55.77 Å2, which indicates their high oral bioavailability. In addition, low values TPSA of less than 60 Å2 shows good permeability through the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB). The all triterpenes 5–24 exhibit the logBB > −1, which suggest their good transport to the brain. The results of in silico study shows, that these compounds can be considered as promising candidates for the treatment of the central nervous system (CNS).Triterpenoids exhibit antiproliferative activity against various cancer cells in vivo, though their precise molecular target it is often difficult to determine. Molecular docking studies showed significant interaction of this class compounds with important anticancer targets such as topoisomerases I and IIα, PPARγ, EGFR, DHFR, VEGFR, NF-κβ, HER-2/neu, hCA-IX, CDK6 and LOX.Molecular docking study of compound 9 was performed based on predictions of biological activity obtained with use of PASS computer program (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances).The predicted biological activity is determined based on the probable activity (Pa) and probable inactivity (Pi). The values of Pa > 0.7 indicate a high probability of a specific activity, which gives a good chance to confirm it in biological studies. The PASS prediction showed anticancer activity of triterpene 9 against lung (Pa > 0.81), melanoma (Pa > 0.80) and breast (Pa > 0.74) cancers in which there is an increased activity of the Akt protein. Additionally, the results obtained for compound 9 from the PASS program confirmed the studies of antiproliferative activity against Hs294T and MCF-7 cells.The serine/threonine kinase Akt is the major signal transducer in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) pathway. Akt plays an important role in the cellular processes related with cancer like cell growth, proliferation, metabolism and angiogenesis. Increased expression of the Akt protein was observed in various human cancers, for example, breast, prostate, lung, ovary and brain cancer.Molecular docking techniques were applied to investigate the binding mechanism for the series of triterpene derivatives with Akt. In our studies we retrieved the crystal structure of Akt1 from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 3QKK). Docking results obtained from the GOLD program for Akt1 showed a higher degree of fit defined in the arbitrary units of the program for triterpene 9 (docking score of 57.55) compared to reference betulin 1 (docking score of 55.44). However, the alkynyl derivative 9 took a different place in the binding pocket than parent betulin 1. The pentacyclic moiety of betulin 1 was located deep in hydrophobic cavity of CAT domain of Akt formed by Phe295/Phe299/Arg331. Significant difference in location compound 9 in CAT domain was observed.The chemistry of the active site cavity in enzyme shows that bounded 2-butynoyl group have deeply penetrated the strong hydrophobic matrix of these proteins. Figure 3 presents the geometry of the Akt1 binding cavities, with betulin 1 and compound 9 buried in the protein’s hydrophobic environment.Molecular shape and hydrophobic behaviour of triterpene 9 seems to be a major factor responsible for its potent inhibitory activity (Figure 4).Favourable hydrophobic interactions were detected between Phe18 and methyl group of the triterpene skeleton at C-8 position at the distance 4.83 Å (Figure 5).On the opposite side, Phe299 was favourably supported by interaction with the C-4 of the 2-butynoyl group at a distance 4.44 Å. Leu38 also exhibited hydrophobic interaction with ethenyl carbon at C-29 position, as well as Arg331 with methyl group at C-4 position at a distance 4.54 and 5.16 Å, respectively.\", \\'ref_38:The E. coli JM109 (DE3) strains harboring pMAL-c2x-AtTPS06, AtTPS18 (and its mutants: TPS18G328P for C5 preparation, and TPS18G328A/F496A for C3/C4/C6 preparation) or AtTPS29, pET-28a-AtGFPPS2, and pMBIS-Tcr (as mentioned above) plasmids were incubated in 1 L of TB medium with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin sodium salt, 20 μg/mL of tetracycline, and 50 μg/mL of kanamycin sulfate, at 37°C and 130 rpm, in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. When the cultures reached an OD600 of 0.4 to 0.5, 250 μL of 1 M IPTG and 8 mL of 50 mg/mL mevalonolactone were added in two portions during further incubation for 48 h at 16°C/130 rpm. The cultured cells were harvested by centrifugation and then lyophilized. The lyophilized cells from 8 L of culture were extracted with acetone. The extract was concentrated, re-extracted with n-hexane, and then repeatedly subjected to silica-gel column chromatography eluted with n-hexane to yield different amounts of pure C1 to C6 (all were obtained as colorless oils): for the NMR data of C1, C2, C4, and C5 see Tables S1 to S2 and Figures S2 to S5. AtTPS18 was inserted into the pET-Duet vector with a 6×His tag at the N terminus. The plasmid was transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain. The transformed bacterial cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin at 37°C and induced by 0.25 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 12 h at 18°C. The cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF. The cells were lysed with a high-pressure cell disruptor at 18,000 p.s.i. (pounds per square inch), and the lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 45 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA affinity column (Qiagen) and washed with buffer A with 20 mM imidazole. The proteins were eluted by buffer A with 250 mM imidazole and purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) with buffer A. Peak fractions were collected and concentrated for subsequent structural and biochemical studies. To obtain the crystals of the AtTPS18 in complex with tis substrates, the protein was incubated with 10-fold molar excesses of GFPP or FSPP on ice for 30 min before crystallization. Crystals of the AtTPS18 complex were grown at 20°C using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method by mixing 0.5 μL of protein solution with 0.5 μL of a solution containing 16% (w/v) PEG8000, 0.04 M potassium phosphate (monobasic), and 20% (v/v) glycerol. Crystals for data collection were directly flash-frozen under a nitrogen stream at 100 K. The data for the AtTPS18 complex were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) beamline BL19U1/17U1 and were processed using the HKL3000 package. The structures of the AtTPS18 complex were solved by molecular replacement using Phenix with the tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (PDB code 5EAT) structure as the initial model. All the models were refined with Phenix (Adams et al., 2010) and manually built with Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table S3.Homology models of Arabidopsis sester-TPSs were generated on the modeling server SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) using the AtTPS18-FSPP structure as a template (Waterhouse et al., 2018). Docking of GFPP or the C25 prenyl intermediate carbocation was carried out using AutoDock4.2.6 with AutoDockTools (Morris et al., 2009). A total of 32 Arabidopsis TPS protein sequences were extracted from TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org). A maximum likelihood tree was constructed using MEGA6.0 software (Tamura et al., 2013).\\', \\'ref_39:At the outset of our work, there was little known about the viability of a secondary neutral N-centered radical cyclizing with a highly polarized olefin such as an enone. Although amidyl, iminyl, and aminium radicals have been fairly well studied, fewer reports have described the cyclization of neutral aminyl radicals. Curiously, only one prior example of a 6-exo cyclizations of a neutral aminyl radical has been reported. In primary aminyl radicals, competitive cyclization between 5-exo and 6-endo pathways is observed and can be tuned by adjusting the substituents on the olefin. Cyclizations of secondary neutral aminyl radicals are less common,− and this might be attributable to an increase in their nucleophilicity relative to primary NCRs. The more nucleophilic NCR would have a higher SOMO energy, resulting in less favorable overlap with the HOMO of a neutral or electron-rich olefin. Similar effects have been observed with alkoxyl radicals, which have intermediate SOMO energies and react as electrophilic radicals with electron rich olefins, but as nucleophilic radicals with electron poor olefins. On the basis of this reactivity, it is reasonable to expect that N-centered radicals might exhibit a similar dichotomy, and the secondary aminyl radicals would react well with electron poor olefins. However, there are limited examples of cyclization of any type of NCR with Michael acceptors, such as enones. Guindon and co-workers reported cyclization of a neutral aminyl radical (derived from 11, Bth = benzothiazole) onto the β-position of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system to generate pyrrolidine 12 (Scheme 4). Efficient cyclization was observed for benzyl derivatives and primary tributylstannyl NCRs, with only a small amount of reduction product 13. However, no cyclization occurred for dialkyl N-centered radicals. In the synthesis of (+)-clividine by Banwell and co-workers, an arylogous unsaturated lactone (14) was employed in a radical cyclization, initiated at nitrogen, to afford pyrrolidine 15 in 83% yield. A major byproduct in the reaction of related structures was the uncyclized N–Cl reduction product. In general, neutral aminyl radicals are particularly prone to nonselective hydrogen atom abstraction reactions, and reduction of the NCR by reaction with tributyltin hydride often out-competes cyclization.As mentioned previously, we believed that the polarization of the olefin by the enone carbonyl was important to the observed reactivity. To validate this hypothesis, we synthesized allylic alcohol substrate 16 (Scheme 5). Treatment of this substrate with AIBN and Bu3SnH in toluene at 80 °C led exclusively to N–Cl reduction, and no products of tandem cyclization were observed. This experiment supports our assertion that the enone is crucial to the observed reactivity.\\', \\'ref_40:Chu et al. (2007) linked the thermostability of another archaeal MK, that from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, to a disulfide bond linking a cysteine located in motif II and a cysteine located in motif III. A mutation of an alanine residue in motif III into a cysteine in MKrat was also shown to increase the thermostability of the enzyme. Although MKmaz, MKvar and MKbur possess the cysteine in motif III, MKmaz and MKvar lack the cysteine in motif II. It would be interesting to perform mutagenesis to assess its potential impact on thermostability.In their review, Liu and coworkers list several characteristics of cold-activated enzymes: differences in the primary structure, such as proline-poor sequences, the presence of glycine, serine and histidine in the central domain, and differences in hydrogen bonding, where less bonding grants more flexibility; flexibility of the active site at the expense of binding efficiency is also reported (Feller & Gerday, 2003). Finally, enzymes from psychrophiles have fewer disulfide bonds, greater hydrophobicity and hydrophobic surfaces, and also appear to have a larger active-site cavity compared with mesothermophilic and thermophilic homologues (Liu et al., 2023). Futher studies will be needed to understand the structural bases that allow MKbur to function at very low temperature.Mevalonate kinases belong to the GHMP kinase superfamily, which includes enzymes such as galactokinase, homoserine kinase, MK and phosphomevalonate kinase. The sequence alignment of MKmaz, MKrat, MKvar and MKbur is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4. Archaeal and eubacterial MK sequences tend to be shorter than those of eukaryotic MKs and differ in the N-terminal region of the enzyme, lacking two α-helices and the loop between them (Fig. 3 ▸, Supplementary Fig. S4). The C-terminus of the MKrat sequence is thought to be involved in metabolite-mediated allosteric inhibition of the enzyme, and it is notable that the eukaryotic sequence does not align with the C-termini of the feedback-resistant archaeal proteins (MKmaz and MKbur; Fu et al., 2008; Supplementary Fig. S5).We confirmed the identity of MKvar before crystallization and structural characterization using MALDI-TOF analysis of a tryptic digest. The sample was confidently identified as a tardigrade mevalonate kinase (UniProt Accession No. A0A1D1VW28) with 62% sequence coverage (Supplementary Fig. S7). Intact mass analysis by LC-MS suggested that the protein was very pure, with a major mass of 45\\\\u2005277.0\\\\u2005Da, corresponding to the theoretical mass of His-tagged MKvar. A mass addition of 178\\\\u2005Da suggested gluconoylation of the His tag. E. coli has been previously reported to (phospho)gluconoylate sequences (Oke et al., 2010; Supplementary Fig. S7).As expected, the sequences contain the conserved motifs of the GHMP enzyme superfamily (Yang et al., 2002; Andreassi & Leyh, 2004; Fu et al., 2002). Motif I is shown in pink in Fig. 3 ▸ and Supplementary Fig. S5. The second conserved GHMP motif is motif II, which is shown in blue (Fig. 3 ▸, Supplementary Fig. S5); this motif forms a loop that is involved in ATP binding (–PXGXGLGSSAA–). Finally, motif III, which is shown in grey (Fig. 3 ▸, Supplementary Fig. S5), is a conserved region which forms a glycine-rich loop and is known to be involved in substrate binding. The aspartate, which is the main catalytic residue (as determined by mutagenesis studies; Potter & Miziorko, 1997), is identified with a star, and other conserved amino acids involved in stabilizing the substrates are marked by arrows (Fu et al., 2002; Andreassi & Leyh, 2004; Potter & Miziorko, 1997; Supplementary Fig. S5).The data-collection and refinement statistics for the MKvar and MKbur crystal structures can be found in Table 1 ▸. The His tag was not resolved in the structure. Like all GHMP superfamily enzymes, each monomer is composed of two domains: an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain separated by a cleft (Fig. 3 ▸ a). Both the mevalonate-binding (motif I and III) and the ATP-binding (motif II) sites are located in the cleft between the two domains, where the mevalonate molecule can be seen (Fig. 3 ▸ b). Motif I is found in β2 in both MKs. Motif II is located in a loop between β7 and α5 in MKvar and between β6 and α2 in MKbur; it is identical in all of the enzymes from the superfamily and is not thought to rearrange upon binding to ATP (Andreassi et al., 2007; Fig. 3 ▸). Finally, motif III is in a loop between β13 and β14 in MKvar and β10 and β11 in MKbur. Andreassi and coworkers describe the loop (between β12 and α8 in MKvar and between β9 and α5 inr MKbur) as a mobile section that forms a lid on the active site that protects MVA and ATP from solvent (Andreassi et al., 2007; Fig. 3 ▸). The catalytic aspartate residue is found at the N-terminus of α7 in MKvar and the N-terminus of α4 in MKbur; this residue is highly conserved across the GHMP family, and although these enzymes act on different substrates and have different regulatory mechanisms (bi-bi, allostery), the involvement of the aspartate residue in the phosphorylation reaction is conserved (Roy et al., 2019).A highly conserved threonine residue at the N-terminus of the α8 helix of MKvar/the α5 helix of MKbur (Figs. 3 ▸ and 4 ▸ b) was also found to be involved in ATP and mevalonate binding, and its mutation led to an increase in K m and a decrease in k cat (Cho et al., 2001). This mutation is also linked to the development of pathology in humans (Andreassi et al., 2007).A loop region between α3 and α4 in MKvar is not seen in the X-ray structure, suggesting high mobility of this loop; mobility in this region is also observed in some other MK structures (Fu et al., 2008). The main structural differences observed between the MKs are found in the N-terminal domain, mirroring what is seen in the sequence alignment. The N-terminal sections missing from eubacterial and archaeal MKs mostly form the two helices α2 and α3 in MKvar and can also be found in rat and human MK (Fu et al., 2008).The MK structures were run through PDBeFold and the closest matches can be found in Supplementary Table S1, arranged by Q-score. Interestingly, the most structurally homologous match to MKvar was not a mevalonate kinase but was PDB entry 4ut4, the heptokinase WcbL from Burkholderia pseudomallei (Vivoli et al., 2015), which was followed by a range of archaeal and eubacterial MKs and a phospho\\\\xadmevalonate kinase from Streptococcus pneumoniae. MKbur returned very high similarity to MKs from archaeal origin, with the highest Q-scores of 0.9 for MK from Methanosarcina mazei and 0.6 for MK from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii.Steady-state kinetic values for (RS)-mevalonate and ATP were determined using a coupled enzyme assay as used previously (Primak et al., 2011; Vinokur et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2008) and apparent kinetic parameters are given in Table 2 ▸; kinetic values for previously published mevalonate kinases are given in Table 3 ▸. Phosphatidic compounds are common inhibitors of mevalonate kinases (Fu et al., 2008; Nyati et al., 2015; Andreassi et al., 2007). The MK from Staphylococcus aureus (MKStaph) was reported to be inhibited in the presence of its product mevalonate 5-phosphate at 1.56\\\\u2005mM (Voynova et al., 2004; Table 3 ▸). Voynova and coworkers determined that the product inhibition of MKStaph was a sign of an ordered sequential mechanism involving first the binding of mevalonate before ATP and then the release of the product before the release of ADP (Voynova et al., 2004). MKvar was found to be inhibited in the presence of >2\\\\u2005mM mevalonate substrate. Although IC50 and K i are not directly comparable, globally the range of sensitivity is as follows: the most sensitive are the mammalian and mosquito MKs, inhibition of which by phosphatidic compounds is within the 10−8–10−7\\\\u2005 M range, then yeast MKs, which are inhibited at around 10−6\\\\u2005 M, followed by eubacterial MKs and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii MK, which are inhibited in the 10−5–10−3\\\\u2005 M range (Table 3 ▸); finally, inhibition is undetected in the archaeal MKs.The active sites of MKvar and MKbur are highly conserved compared with the active sites of the other characterized MKs (Fig. 4 ▸); all of the conserved amino acids are shown in sticks for MKvar and align with those in MKbur, as well as the motifs I, II and III characteristic of the GHMP family.The C5 hydroxyl group of the mevalonate substrate is thought to be deprotonated by the catalytic aspartate residue, which then proceeds to perform a nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of ATP (Fig. 5 ▸).The mevalonate molecule is stabilized by interactions with the conserved amino acids located near the catalytic amino acid Asp224/Asp138 (in MKvar/MKbur). The catalytic role of this aspartate residue was demonstrated by Potter and Mizioro, who showed that mutation of the aspartate to an alanine or an arginine led to no detectable activity (Potter & Miziorko, 1997). The roles of Ser221/Ser135, His20/His16, Lys14/Lys9 and Ala354/Ala259 in MKvar/MKbur have been deduced from their conservation amongst the GHMP family as well as by their close location to the substrate (Sgraja et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2016; Miller & Kung, 2018; McClory et al., 2019; Figs. 4 ▸ a and 4 ▸ b).The highly conserved Glu213/Glu127 and Ser163/Ser95 (in MKvar/MKbur) have been found to be involved in ATP binding and more specifically to coordinate the Mg2+ ion that activates the γ-phosphate of ATP (Yang et al., 2002; Fu et al., 2002; Figs. 4 ▸ c and 4 ▸ d); when this Glu was mutated to an alanine by Potter and Mizioro it turned the human MK into a labile protein, and when it was replaced by a glutamine it lowered the K m for ATP and the V max (Potter & Miziorko, 1997). The conserved Thr residue involved in binding the tail of the ATP can be seen in the yellow lid portion (Thr263/Thr174 in MKvar/MKbur; Figs. 4 ▸ c and 4 ▸ d; Cho et al., 2001). A conserved Arg residue in MKrat (Arg241), corresponding to Arg261 in MKvar, was found to be essential in binding the tail of ATP and moves inside the active site upon binding the substrates (McClory et al., 2019); no equivalent arginine residue can be found in MKbur or MKmaz, where it is replaced by a serine.MKs are inhibited as part of the terpene pathway regulatory mechanism, usually by longer prenylphosphates built by the condensation of IPP/DMAPP in the lower part of the pathway (Potter & Miziorko, 1997); however, there is a range of sensitivity depending on the genus of origin (Table 3 ▸). In general, longer prenylphosphate compounds, such as FPP, appear to cause greater inhibition than the shorter GPP, which agrees with our observations (Fig. 6 ▸).MKmaz and MKbur were found to possess activity in the presence of up to 100\\\\u2005µM of both FPP and GPP, compared with the almost total loss of activity recorded for MKvar, where <20% residual activity remains in the presence of 100\\\\u2005µM GPP and only 0.4% remains with 100\\\\u2005µM FPP (Fig. 6 ▸). Kazieva et al. (2017) did not observe any inhibition of MKmaz activity in the presence of 100\\\\u2005µM GPP and FPP, whereas we recorded a loss of activity, with 92% and 70% residual activity remaining in the presence of 100\\\\u2005µM GPP and FPP, respectively (Fig. 6 ▸). This decrease might not be a reflection of inhibition; it might simply be a reflection of the thermodynamics of the reaction, or it may be explained by the difference in assay methods. MKbur, like MKmaz, appears to be less sensitive to inhibition.The N-terminal end of helix α4/α1 (in MKvar/MKbur), marked in dark green in Fig. 7 ▸ and known to be involved in inhibition, also varies between feedback-inhibited MKvar and MKbur. The structural basis of the inhibition of MKs has been studied using the MKs from rat and human (Fu et al., 2008). Fu and coworkers determined by mutagenesis that truncating the C-terminal end of human and rat MK (at Arg388, which does not exist in MKvar), and also mutating Thr104 and Ile196 in human MK, decreased the feedback inhibition in human MK (Fu et al., 2008). In MKvar, Thr119 and Ile215 align with Thr104 and Ile196, respectively, in human MK. MKbur has a conserved Ile residue; however, Thr119, which can be found at the N-terminus of the α4 helix (Figs. 4 ▸ c and 4 ▸ d) in MKvar, is not present in the N-terminal region of α1 in MKbur. The distance between Thr119 (the N-terminus of the α4 helix) and the ribose of the ATP molecule is ∼3\\\\u2005Å in MKvar, compared with a distance of ∼7\\\\u2005Å to the N-terminus of the α1 helix in MKbur.Comparison of the active sites of MKvar, MKrat, MKbur and MKmaz shows differences in the cleft region (Fig. 7 ▸, Supplementary Fig. S8 and Table S2). The sides of the cleft are composed of two variable regions: a variable loop (in dark red in Figs. 7 ▸, 4 ▸ c and 4 ▸ d) and the N-terminus of helix α4/α1 on one side (in MKvar/MKbur; dark green in Fig. 7 ▸) and a lid portion at the bottom on the other side (in yellow in Figs. 7 ▸, 3 ▸ c and 3 ▸ d). Further mutational studies would be needed in order to further specify the structural basis of inhibition of MKvar for prenylphosphate compounds or non-inhibition in the case of MKbur.\\', \\'ref_41:The mechanism and primary photochemical reaction of the keto-carotenoid that triggers this OCPO-OCPR conversion is currently debated and requires structural evidence. It has been argued that OCP photoactivation is initiated by H-bond rupture between the 4-keto group of the β1-ring and neighbouring residues Y201 and W288. Several different proposals have been made for the primary photochemistry resulting in this particular H-bond rupture: (1) a charge transfer state; (2) a shift in keto–enol equilibrium; (3) a transfer of vibrational energy from the carotenoid to the protein leading to the H-bond rupture, similar to H-bond rupture in bacteriorhodopsin; (4) a structurally distorted form of the carotenoid in the S1 state characterized by increased carotenoid planarity; (5) a photoinduced s-isomerization of the C6-C7 single bond, flipping the orientation of the β1-ring by 90°. Support for s-isomerization in OCP stemmed from the X-ray structure of the isolated NTD (also known as red carotenoid protein, RCP), in which the keto-carotenoid was present in a C6-C7 s-cis conformation, and frequency calculations showing agreement between a C6-C7 s-cis conformation and OCPR Resonance Raman data. However, the hypothesis for s-isomerization in OCPR is not consistent with recent infra-red (IR) anisotropy observations. A recent study of the fluorescence spectra and yields of OCPO with different carotenoids suggested that the mechanism of OCP photoactivation does not involve the keto group of the β1 ring but includes out-of-plane motions of the β2 ring. In the photoreceptor, rhodopsin, its photosensing pigment, retinal, which is synthesized from a carotenoid by irreversible oxidative cleavage, undergoes an “aborted” bicycle pedal (BP) double bond rotation as part of vision photokinetics. During this process BP motion is observed as part of the S1 relaxation, while one of the two reacting double bonds rotate back during S0 relaxation. Such a photoresponse, however, has never been proposed for OCP. Here, we show time resolved crystallographic and spectroscopic evidence that resolves the initial photoproducts and subsequent structural propagation in the OCP activation process.Figure 1b shows the light-induced absorption changes measured in crystals and solutions of OCP. In contrast to a previous crystallographic investigation of OCP photoactivation, we observe that the absorbance spectra of OCPO in solution and in crystals are nearly identical (Fig. 1b), thereby providing evidence for the same electronic structure of the carotenoid in both crystals and solution. Illumination of crystals with 410 nm light and 3.5 mWcm−2 power density causes a significant spectral red-shift of 25 nm due to OCPO-OCPR conversion within 5 min on average (Fig. 1b insert). In solution, a similar spectral shift is observed: it occurs on the same timescale as in crystals, but slightly faster (3 min), as resolved from the detailed spectroscopic analysis described later in the manuscript. Strong similarities between the photoresponses in the crystals and in solution therefore allow us to conclude that OCP is photoactive in crystals with very similar photoresponse characteristics as seen in solution. An early reaction intermediate was captured by intense illumination and cryo-trapping of OCP crystals. The crystal structure and carotenoid conformation were determined at 1.3 Å resolution for the dark state (OCPO, Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1) and found to be in good agreement with those reported in previous X-ray studies (Table 1). The data furthermore supports identification of glycerol, acetate, the Cl− ion and 401 water molecules in the crystal structure (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 2, 3). The location of Cl− in this study was confirmed by long-wavelength X-ray crystallography (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3). In brief, the contribution of Cl− to the anomalous scattering signal at 2.9 keV is 3.95 e− (f”), whereas at 2.8 keV, this value is 0.40 e− (f”). The difference between these two values allows for specific sites of Cl to be identified by observing the anomalous difference Fourier map at the expected Cl site for each (Fig. 2b). Cl− is resolved in the CTD, where it coordinates four water molecules through ion–dipole interactions at distances of 3.0–3.2 Å (HOH16, HOH23, and HOH46) and 4.0 Å (HOH41). The closest CAN carbon is C12, located at 4.1 Å distance from the Cl− ion in the CTD (Fig. 2a). Three amino acids (L248, T275, and P276) are within 4 Å distance from Cl−. The electron density assigned to the Cl− ion, was attribute—to Cl− in the first OCP crystal structure (PDB entry 5UI2) based on the signal intensity and crystallization conditions, but subsequently has been assigned to a water molecule in several reports: HOH609 (PDB entry 5TV0), HOH699 (PDB entry 5TUX), HOH673 (PDB entry 4XB5), and HOH1020 (PDB entry 3MG1). In addition to OCPO, X-ray crystallography data was collected of four illuminated structural intermediates I1, I2, I3, and I4 corresponding to 1, 2, 5, and 10 min of illumination. Data collection and refinement statistics were comparable to that of the OCPO reference data. Q-weighted FLight–FDark difference electron density (DED) maps, indicating light-induced changes in X-ray data, and CAN coordinates at different time points (see “Methods”, Fig. 3) are presented in Fig. 1c. The coordinates for the partially occupied illuminated state (I1–I4, Fig. 1c) were resolved through their refinement to extrapolated structure factors based on the approach described previously.\\', \\'ref_42:1. introduction Terpene synthases (TPS) are key enzymes in constructing terpene carbon skeletons. They accept the ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates geranyl diphosphate (GDP), farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) as substrates and convert them into the basic mono-, sesqui- and diterpene skeletons, respectively. The basic principles of terpene synthase reaction mechanisms were derived from studies with substrate analogs, inhibitors, and intermediates carried out on native and mutated enzymes (reviewed in [Degenhardt et al. \\\\\\\\(2009\\\\\\\\)\\\\\\\\)](#page-7-0). Most of the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes are initiated by a divalent metal ion-dependent dephosphorylation of the substrate resulting in the formation of a highly reactive carbocationic intermediate. This reactive intermediate can undergo a series of cyclizations, hydride shifts or other rearrangements like methyl and alkyl shifts. The reaction is terminated by proton loss or addition of water affording terpene hydrocarbons and alcohols, respectively ([Wise and Croteau, 1999; Cane, 1999\\\\\\\\)](#page-7-0). Terpene synthases are also able to produce enzyme-bound neutral intermediates that are further cyclized after reprotonation ([Rising](#page-7-0) [et al., 2000; Köllner et al., 2008; Garms et al., 2010](#page-7-0)). Many terpene synthases convert their substrates into a multitude of products. For example, the recently published enzyme MtTPS5 from Medicago truncatula is able to produce 27 different sesquiterpenes from the substrate FDP ([Garms et al., 2010](#page-7-0)). One reason for this enormous product promiscuity is the ability of terpene synthases to direct their reaction cascades through alternative intermediates during different reaction cycles [\\\\\\\\(Degenhardt et al.,](#page-7-0) [2009\\\\\\\\)](#page-7-0). A variable starting conformation of the substrate as well as conformational changes of carbocationic intermediates guided by the active site contour are also discussed to be responsible for multiple product formation of terpene synthases ([Vedula et al., 2005;](#page-7-0) [Christianson, 2006; Köllner et al., 2006\\\\\\\\)](#page-7-0). Recently, we identified and characterized the two sesquiterpene synthases SbTPS1 and SbTPS2 from Sorghum bicolor ([Zhuang et al.,](#page-7-0) [2012\\\\\\\\)](#page-7-0). Both enzymes produced a mixture of seven terpenes dominated by zingiberene, b-bisabolene and b-sesquiphellandrene. While zingiberene was the most abundant product of SbTPS1, SbTPS2 produced b-sesquiphellandrene as the major product and only traces of zingiberene. Using sequence comparison and homology modeling we identified a single amino acid polymorphism in the active site of SbTPS1 and SbTPS2 which was shown to be responsible for different product specificity. A change from leucine 401 into valine in SbTPS1 and the corresponding reverse valine/ leucine change in SbTPS2 interconverted the catalytic activity of both enzymes ([Zhuang et al., 2012\\\\\\\\)](#page-7-0). In this study, we investigated the reaction mechanism of SbTPS1 and SbTPS2. The stereochemical analysis of reaction products, intermediates and hydride shifts allowed us to identify the ![](_page_0_Picture_22.jpeg) <sup>⇑</sup> Corresponding author.

In silico docking demonstrated, that small conformational changes of the final carbocationic intermediate caused by the leucine/valine polymorphism may determine the site of deprotonation and therefore the ratio of zingiberene to b-sesquiphellandrene produced by the two enzymes.Models of the three dimensional structure of SbTPS1 were generated using the Swiss-Model Server [http://www.expasy.org; Schwede et al., 2003]. For modeling, the cDNA sequence was fitted to the crystal structure of tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase mutant W273S ([Starks et al., 1997; PDB ID, 1HX9A) which contains three magnesium ions and the substrate analogue farnesyl hydroxyphosphonate. Model quality was checked with the programs ProSA-web [Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007] and the assessment tools provided by the Swiss-Model Server. The three magnesium ions and the pyrophosphate group of the substrate were added into the SbTPS1 model at the appropriate positions as in 1HX9A. A model of the SbTPS1 mutant L401V was created using the mutagenesis tool provided by the Swiss-PdbViewer4.0 ([Guex and Peitsch, 1997]). For docking, non-polar hydrogen atoms were added to the models of SbTPS1 and SbTPS1 L401V using the program AutoDockTools [Trott and Olson, 2010]. An energy-minimized (MM2) ligand structure of the (6S)-bisabol-1-yl cation was generated with the software ChemDraw and Chem3D (CambridgeSoft Corporation, Cambridge, USA). Docking of the ligand into the active site cavity was performed with the flexible ligand docking software AutoDoc Vina (Trott and Olson, 2010). The resulting models were visualized with the program PyMOL [http://www.pymol.org].\\', \\'ref_43:Compound 1 was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The HRESIMS showed the [M-H]− at m/z 516.2753 to be consistent with the molecular formula C32H39NO5, accounting for 14 degrees of unsaturation (Figure S8). The characteristic absorption at λmax (logε) 253 (1.55) and 283 (1.73) nm from the UV spectra indicated that the compound contained an indole structural fragment. The 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S1) showed a characteristic indole hydrogen signal at δH 10.64 (1H, s, 12-NH); multiple overlapping methylene hydrogen signals between δH 1.84–2.86; and six methyl signals—δH 1.44 (3H, s, H-5″), 1.43 (3H, s, H-4″), 1.37 (3H, s, H-2′), 1.27 (3H, s, Me-12b), 1.13 (3H, s, Me-12c), and 1.08 (3H, s, H-3′) (Table 1). The above hydrogen spectral signals suggested that the compound possessed the indole diterpenoid skeleton. The 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S2) combined with the DEPT spectrum (Figure S3) revealed the presence of 32 carbon signals in the compound, including one carbonyl carbon signal, δC 197.2; six alkenyl carbon signals, δC 167.7 (C-4a), 151.4 (C-12a), 149.2 (C-2″), 111.4 (C-3″), 119.8 (C-4), and 114.6 (C-7a); and six methyl carbon signals, δC 29.4 (C-5″), 29.2 (C-4″), 28.4 (C-2′), 22.9 (C-3′), 22.4 (Me-12c), and 16.0 (Me-12b). Comparison of the NMR spectra of this compound with Compound 3 revealed that the substituent C7H4NO was missing at position 5 in compound 1, and the carbon signal at C-5 in 3 was shifted from δC 74.8 in high field to δC 69.8 in 1. It was thus speculated that a hydroxyl substituted at C-5, which was further confirmed by the correlation signals in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Figure S5) between δH 5.24 (1H, s, OH-5) and δH 4.10 (H, m, H-5) and the correlation signals between OH-5 and C-4b/6 in the HMBC spectrum (Figure S6). Furthermore, correlations between H-4 and C-4b/2/14a can also be observed in the HMBC spectrum. Compound 1 had an additional C5H9 substituent at C-9 compared to 3, as confirmed by the correlation signals in the HMBC spectra of H-5″ with C-1″/2″, H-4″ with C-1″/9, and H-8/10 with C-1″ (Figure 2). The planar structure of 1 was thus determined.The key NOESY correlations in the NOESY spectra (Figure S7) of Me-12b (δH 1.27) with H-13α (δH 2.44) and OH-4b (δH 4.52) and Me-12c (δH 1.13) with H-6a (δH 2.67), H-5 (δH 4.10), and H-13β (δH 2.72) (Figure 3) indicated that Me-12b, H-13α, and OH-4b were in the same direction, while Me-12c, H-13β, H-5, and H-6a were in the same direction. Furthermore, previous studies had shown that the strongest negative cotton effect at short ECD wavelengths (λmax 210–250 nm) came from the π-π* leaps of the indole nucleus, which could be used to determine the absolute configurations of C-4b, C-6b, C-12b, and C-12c in hexacyclic indole diterpenoids. Thus, the absolute configurations of 4b, 5, 6a, 12b, 12c could be determined as 4bS, 5S, 6aR, 12bS, and 12cR based on λmax 242 (Δε −188.7) nm in CD and the associated signals in NOESY. While the absolute configurations at positions 2 and 14a were determined by comparing the carbon signals with the calculated values of the NMR data from the literature, it was hypothesized that there were two possible configurations, 1a (2R, 4bS, 5S, 6aR, 12bS, 12cR, 14aS) and 1b (2S, 4bS, 5S, 6aR, 12bS, 12cR, 14aR), for compound 1. ECD calculations of the two configurations were carried out using Boltzmann-weighted time-varying density flooding theory (TDDFT). Geometry optimization was carried out using the DFT method, and the geometry-optimized conformations were further calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G* level using SMD. The calculated values were compared with the experimental values, and it was found that the ECD calculated values of 1a coincided with the experimental values (Figure 4), from which the absolute configuration of 1 was determined as 2R, 4bS, 5S, 6aR, 12bS, 12cR, 14aS, and it was designated as 5S-hydroxy-β-aflatrem.Compound 2 was obtained as a white amorphous powder. Its molecular formula was determined to be C32H39NO5 based on a HRESIMS peak at m/z 516.2753 [M-H]− (Figure S16), and the degree of unsaturation was 14, which was consistent with the molecular formula and degree of unsaturation of 1. Comparison of the NMR data of 2 with those of 1 revealed that the NMR data of the two compounds were similar (Table 1), but from the correlation signals of H-13 with C-14a and OH-14 with C-13/14a in the HMBC spectrum (Figure S14) combined with the correlation signals of δH 1.86 (2H, m, H-13) and δH 4.10 (1H, t, J = 6.4 Hz, H-14) in 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Figure S13), it could be inferred that the hydroxyl substitution in compound 2 was at C-14 (Figure 2), and thus, the planar structure of compound 2 could be determined.In the NOESY spectra (Figure S15), the key NOESY correlations of Me-12b (δH 1.28) with H-5α (δH 2.75) and OH-4b (δH 4.54) and Me-12c (δH 1.08) with H-6a (δH 2.73), H-14, and H-5β (δH 1.83) (Figure 3) showed that Me-12b, H-5α, OH-4b, and OH-14 were in the same direction, while Me-12c, H-5β, H-14, and H-6a were in the same direction. The absolute configurations of 4b, 6a, 12b, 12c, and 14 could be identified as 4bS, 6aS, 12bS, 12cR, and 14R, respectively, based on the negative cotton effect at λmax 239 (Δε − 90.7) nm in CD. Comparing the carbon signals at positions 2 and 14a with the calculated values from the NMR data in the literature, it was hypothesized that there were two possible configurations, 2a (2R, 4bS, 6aS, 12bS, 12cR, 14R, 14aR) and 2b (2S, 4bS, 6aS, 12bS, 12cR, 14R, 14aS) for compound 2. The ECD calculations of 2a and 2b were performed using TDDFT, and the calculated values were compared with the experimental values of 2. It was found that the ECD calculated values of 2a were in better agreement with the experimental values (Figure 4), which allowed us to determine the absolute configuration of 2 as 2R, 4bS, 6aS, 12bS, 12cR, 14R, 14aR and to name it as 14R-hydroxy-β-aflatrem.Compounds (1–3) were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines, including lung cancer cell A549, cervical cancer cell Hela, liver cancer cell Hep G2, and breast cancer cell MCF-7 with various concentrations for 48 h and then performed methyl thiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assays. Compound 1 displayed better inhibitory activities against Hela, Hep G2, and MCF-7 cells, with IC50 values of 12.54, 15.06, and 26.56 µM, respectively (Table 2). The most active, Compound 1, was selected for further research.Apoptosis, which occurs normally during development and aging, is a homeostatic mechanism for maintaining tissue cell populations and an important strategy for treating cancer. Apoptosis leads to cell death with cell nuclear pyknosis and apoptotic body production, which was observed via fluorescence microscopy after Hoechst 33258 staining. As shown in Figure 5A, untreated cells showed uniform blue fluorescence, but Hela cells treated with 1 for 48 h showed clear apoptotic signals, with shrinkage of chromatin, fragmentation of nuclei, and bright blue fluorescence, and apoptotic bodies appeared in apoptotic cells.We further investigated the effect of 1 on apoptosis using the mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit (JC-1). Decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was a hallmark event in the early stage of apoptosis. The decrease in membrane potential could be easily detected by the shift of JC-1 from red to green fluorescence, and the shift of JC-1 from red to green fluorescence could also be used as an indicator of the early stage of cell apoptosis. Treatment of Hela cells with 0, 6.25, 12.50, and 25.00 µM concentrations of 1 for 48 h showed a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential with increasing concentration (Figure 5B). Further analysis of the expression of proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes via real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR that 1 could up-regulate pro-apoptotic genes BAX and Caspase-3 but down-regulate anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-xL and XIXP (Figure 5C). These results indicated that compound 1 promoted cell apoptosis.Wound healing is one of the hallmarks of tumorigenesis. As shown in Figure 6A, treatment of cells with compound 1 for 48 h significantly inhibited the migration ability of Hela cells. In line with the wound-healing assay, a transwell assay displayed that the level of cell invasion was strikingly decreased after 48 h treatment with 1, although cell viability was unaffected (Figure 6B). These results indicated that 1 was also able to antagonize cell migration and invasion in the Hela cells, with potential activity to inhibit the metastasis of tumor cells.\\', \\'ref_44:**introduction** Terpenes represent one of the most diverse and structurally complex class of biomolecules generated by nature.[1–5] Miscellaneous bioactivities arise from this vast diversity of natural products that are of profound industrial interest. In contrast to chemical synthesis of terpenes, terpene synthases (TPSs) offer a sustainable route to produce these bioactive molecules at an industrially relevant scale using biotechnology principles. A well-established TPS model is the terpene cyclase CotB2, a bacterial diterpene synthase derived from the cyclooctatin biosynthetic gene cluster of *Streptomyces melanosporofaciens.* Cyclooctatin shows potent anti-inflammatory activity, thus the elucidation and control of cyclooctatin biosynthesis is of high interest for the pharmaceutical sector. CotB2 is responsible for the synthesis of the intermediate cyclooctat-9-en-7-ol.[6] It catalyses the cyclization of the linear, aliphatic substrate *E*,*E*,*E*- - [a] *S. Himpich,<sup>+</sup> N.

Here we investigate the catalytic mechanism of CotB2 variant V80L in a holistic, biochemical, structural, and computational biology approach. We were able to identify an altered product profile compared to CotB2WT for the substrates geranylgeranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate. Moreover, we solved the crystal structure, and shed further light on terpene synthase chemistry by modelling of the substrate and intermediate binding. geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP), and represents the first committed step in the biosynthesis of cyclooctatin. Initially, it was reported that the only substrate of CotB2 is GGDP.[6] Recently, it was demonstrated that CotB2 can also cyclize farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) as an alternative substrate.[7] In addition to the cyclization activity, a prenylation activity was detected for CotB2, with indole as a substrate in presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate or geranyl diphosphate.[8] CotB2 has been identified to perform a highly specific regioand stereochemical reaction. Further, several mutagenesis studies revealed, that this highly specific biosynthesis cascade can be reprogrammed by single amino acid substitutions, with a focus on aromatic amino acid side chains in the active site generating alternative diterpene products with diverse bioactivities.[9–11] Further structural and biochemical characterization and structure-based mutagenesis approaches, can pave the way for new drug lead alternatives to cyclooctatin.[9–12] CotB2 belongs to class I TPSs, that initially generate an allylic carbocation by the release of pyrophosphate in a trinuclear Mg2<sup>+</sup>-metal cluster. The members of this class comprise two distinct motifs, an aspartate-rich DDXXD motif binding the diphosphate group of the substrate and a NSE/DTE motif, which supports correct positioning of the substrate with a trinuclear Mg<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> cluster. Upon binding of the substrate and three Mg<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> cations, TPSs undergo a conformational change from an open to a closed conformation. Biochemical, and structural investigations of CotB2 and variants, revealed the importance of the last 13 C-terminal amino acids. Upon closure of the active site, this initially unstructured loop forms a lid over the active site.[11] Thereby a C-terminal RY-pair establishes interaction with the substrate and the aspartate-rich as well as the NSE motif. This closed conformation was shown to be a prerequisite for enzymatic activity, underlined by the fact, that the CotB2 variant terminating at R294 lacking the last 12 Cterminal residues (CotB2<sup>Δ</sup><sup>C</sup> ) is an inactive variant, defective in binding the substrate, hence not capable of catalysis.[11] Even though two Mg2<sup>+</sup> cations were bound to the structure, we failed to crystallize CotB2<sup>Δ</sup><sup>C</sup> in its closed conformation in line on a molecular level, we subsequently initiated a structural characterization of CotB2V80L.**Keywords:** terpene synthase **·** protein structure **·** biocatalysis **·** green chemistry **·** computational chemistry **·** QM/MM calculations [1] D.

These results indicate that the TPS family has undergone expansion throughout the evolutionary history of land plants, and different species may show a difference in the expansion mechanism ([Chen et al., 2011](#page-12-3); [Jiang et al., 2019](#page-12-2)). We also annotated 32 *CfTPS* genes, and the results showed that all TPSs in the TPS-a clade encode sesquiterpenes, and all TPSs in the TPS-b clade encode monoterpenes (**[Table 1](#page-4-0)**). All the *CfTPS* in the TPS-e/f clade were annotated as diterpene synthases. This is consistent with a recent study in which most TPS genes in the TPS-a subfamily were determined to be sesquiterpene synthases. TPS-e/f encoded monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and diterpene in a recent study ([Chen et al., 2011](#page-12-3)). Sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and monoterpenes are important to emit floral scents to attract pollinators and defend against environmental stress ([Huang et al., 2021](#page-12-7)). <span id=\"page-9-1\"></span>![](_page_9_Figure_10.jpeg) heatmap was produced in Tbtools ([Chen et al., 2018](#page-12-8)). The tissues were leaves (L), pseudobulbs (Ps), petals (Pe), sepals (Se), labellum (La), and gynostemium (Gs) in wild *C. faberi*. The fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments (FPKM) values are listed in [Supplementary Table S9](#page-12-17). Each full-length TPS had two conserved domains, including the N-terminal domain containing the RRX8W motif and the C-terminal domain containing two highly conserved aspartate-rich motifs: DDxxD and NSE/DTE ([Starks et al., 1997](#page-13-26); [Jiang et al., 2019](#page-12-2)). DDxxD and NSE/DTE are significant in the metal-dependent ionization of the prenyl diphosphate substrate, and the RRX8W motif is essential in the cyclization of monoterpene synthase ([Bohlmann et al., 1998](#page-12-24); [Chen et al., 2011](#page-12-3); [Jiang et al., 2019](#page-12-2)). The secondary \"R\" in the TPS-a subfamily is not conserved ([Martin et al., 2010](#page-13-8)). TPS-b contains the conserved RRX8W motif, which is related to monoterpene formation. TPS-c does not include the DDxxD motif ([Chen et al., 2011](#page-12-3); [Jiang et al., 2019](#page-12-2)). Motif RxR was also conserved in TPS-a and TPS-b subfamilies. In this study, multiple sequence alignments showed that 28/32 *CfTPS* had highly conserved DDxxD motifs, 16/32 *CfTPS* had RRX8W motifs, 16/32 *CfTPS* had NSE/DTE motifs, and 9/32 *CfTPS* had RxR motifs. The RRX8W motif was not found in 11 *CfTPSs* in the TPS-a and TPS-b clades, and it was absent in the TPS-e/f subfamily. The results indicated that motif loss might have appeared during family evolution in *C. faberi* and that different subfamilies have different motif features.<span id=\"page-10-0\"></span>![](_page_10_Figure_2.jpeg) Different elements were observed in promoter areas of *CfTPS* genes. Most of the *cis*-elements were in the phytohormone responsiveness group, and the number of MYCs associated with MeJA responsiveness contained most of this group. The results indicated that the expression patterns of *CfTPS* may be regulated by MeJA treatment and may respond to multiple environmental stresses ([Chaiprasongsuk et al., 2018](#page-12-28)). In recent studies, MeJA was shown to regulate TPS gene expression in *D. officinale* and *C. sinensis* ([Yu et al., 2020](#page-13-11); [Zhao et al., 2020](#page-13-27); [Zhou et al., 2020](#page-13-12)). However, this needs to be further investigated in *C. faberi*. The *K*a/*K*s ratio analysis indicated that the TPS gene family in *C. faberi* mainly underwent negative selection, making it more stable during the evolution. GO annotation analysis of *CfTPS* genes indicated that molecular function contained most genes, and genes were mostly enriched in lyase activity, magnesium binding, and terpene synthase activity. Expression pattern analysis indicated that *CfTPS* <span id=\"page-11-0\"></span>![](_page_11_Figure_2.jpeg) <span id=\"page-11-1\"></span>![](_page_11_Figure_3.jpeg) RT-qPCR primers of *CfTPS* are listed in [Supplementary Table S12](#page-12-17). genes were mainly expressed in the floral organs of *C. faberi*, indicating that they were related to floral scent. We selected four *CfTPS* genes with the highest transcript levels in floral organs for qRT-PCR analysis at three flowering stages. The results showed that they all belonged to the TPS-b clade and were mainly expressed in the full flowering stage. According to our annotation, four genes were all annotated as monoterpene synthases, which may play essential roles in floral scent and attracting pollinators in *C. faberi*. Enzymatic assays suggested that *CfTPS18* could convert GPP to β-myrcene, geraniol, and α-pinene. In recent reports, *DoTPS10* in *D. officinale* can convert GPP to linalool *in vitro* ([Yu et al., 2020](#page-13-11)). *DoGES1* in *D. officinale* can catalyze geraniol *in vitro* and *in vivo* ([Zhao et al., 2020](#page-13-27)). Linalool and geraniol belong to monoterpenes which play essential roles in floral scents. TPS that catalyze terpenes can also be found in *V. vinifera*, *M. domestica*, and *Litsea cubeba* ([Martin et al., 2010](#page-13-8); [Nieuwenhuizen et al., 2013](#page-13-9); [Chen et al., 2020](#page-12-29)). To better understand terpenes production and function in *C. faberi*, more studies of expression profiles should be developed.\\', \\'ref_46:The WRKY domain, which determines the molecular structures and functions of all WRKY proteins, consisted of the WRKYGQK and zinc finger motifs. The WRKYGQK motif was conserved in almost all TcWRKY factors, except for several subgroup IIc WRKYs, which was WRKYGKK instead in TcWRKY34, TcWRKY49, TcWRKY51, and TcWRKY55 (Fig. 2). The WRKYGKK sequence is the most common variant present in Group IIc not only in Taxus but also in soybean, Solanum lycopersicum, Lotus japonicus, and Brassica oleracea var. capitata. In addition to the conserved domains/motifs, WRKY proteins contain many diverse conserved domains, such as B3 domain, NAC (named after NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 proteins) domain, zinc finger_SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein, Toll–interleukin receptor (TIR), leucine-rich repeat (LRR), paired amphipathic helix repeat (PAH), cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), and kinase domain. Aside from the Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding domain (CaMBD), all of Group IId TcWRKYs and AtWRKYs also contain the plant zinc finger cluster (Plant_zf_clust, PF10533) domain (Fig. 3). This result is in accordance with previous reports. Group IIe and IId are commonly considered one subgroup, although Group IIe has no CaMBD. According to our results, Group IIe contains a peptide that is highly similar to the Plant_zf_clust domain of Group IId, such that they share similar functions and relationships (Fig. 3). TcWRKY57 also contains an HSF-type DNA-binding (HSF_DNA-bind, pfam00447) domain at its N-terminal (44 aa-133 aa) (Fig. 3). TcWRKY24 (Group IId) contains the HARF (RTGHARFRR [A/G] P) motif, whose function has not been clearly determined, in its CaMBD (Fig. 3). Several TcWRKY proteins also contain the LxxLL motif, which participates in many protein–protein interactions associated with different aspects of transcriptional regulation, i.e., TcWRKY12 (LSQLL, Group I), TcWRKY20 (LYQLL, Group III), TcWRKY24 (LIRLL, Group IId), TcWRKY32 (LVRLL, Group I), TcWRKY33 (LSPLL, Group I), TcWRKY40 (LIQLL, Group IId), and TcWRKY48 (LSPLL, Group I) (Fig. 3, supplement S2). The NCBI BLASTP results showed that TcWRKY3 and TcWRKY60 contain a leucine zipper (pfam15294) domain at the N-terminal (93 aa-147 aa), which is also detected in AtWRKY6 (IIb) (Fig. 4b). Overall, some novel conserved domains were detected in TcWRKY proteins. However, current conserved domains detected in WRKY proteins, such as LRR, were not identified in TcWRKYs. Moreover, completed sequences need to be further identified to clarify the molecular structure of WRKYs in Taxus. Notably, several Group IIb TcWRKYs contain the ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, which is a strong repression domain present in various repressors. TcWRKY4/27/52 has the LKLDLY-type EAR motif, whereas TcWRKY3/16/60 has the LKLALS-type EAR motif. TcWRKY3/60 also has an LSLGLN-type EAR motif at the C-terminal of the LKLDLY-type EAR motif (Fig. 4). Several AtWRKYs also contain the EAR motif, i.e., AtWRKY14 (IIe) and AtWRKY18 (IIa) had the DLNxNP-type EAR motif, whereas AtWRKY9 (IIb) has two LSLSL-type EAR motifs. According to our results, AtWRKY36 (IIb) contains the LKLLLS-type EAR motif (Fig. 4). Notably, no Group IIa or IIe TcWRKYs contains any EAR motif.A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the three experimental datasets to determine the potential roles of the 61 TcWRKY genes in plant responses to various environmental stresses (Fig. 5). NA denotes the newly isolated cells, whereas CA denotes the 10 year long-term subcultured cells; the taxol content between these two samples was highly different. Methyl jasmonate acid (MeJA) and gibberellin (GA) are plant endogenous hormones. Most TcWRKYs changed significantly in the three experimental datasets (Fig. 5). Of 61 TcWRKYs, 50 were changed significantly, 43 were downregulated after MeJA treatment for 15\\\\u2009h, and only TcWRKY3/60 (Group IIb) and TcWRKY17/18/49/55/56 (Group IIc) were increased. Of 55 differentially expressed (DE) TcWRKYs, 45 were downregulated after GA treatment for 3\\\\u2009h. TcWRKY4/27/52 (Group IIb), TcWRKY7/8 (Group IIc), TcWRKY22/37 (Group I), TcWRKY44 (Group IId), and TcWRKY25/36 (Group IIa) were induced by GA treatment. Of 57 DE TcWRKYs, 42 were downregulated in NA than in CA. TcWRKY7/8/11/17/46/56 (Group IIc), TcWRKY10/25/50/36 (Group IIa), TcWRKY14/19/43/41 (Group IIe), and TcWRKY44 (Group IId) were upregulated in NA. A total of seven TcWRKYs, one from each subgroup, i.e., TcWRKY26 (Group I), TcWRKY47 (Group IIa), TcWRKY52 (Group IIb), TcWRKY8 (Group IIc), TcWRKY44 (Group IId), TcWRKY41 (Group IIe), and TcWRKY20 (Group III), were selected. The expression patterns of these TcWRKY genes responding to MeJA and SA treatments were determined. Results showed that the seven TcWRKYs had different response patterns to MeJA and SA treatments. After MeJA treatment, TcWRKY8, TcWRKY20, TcWRKY26, TcWRKY41, TcWRKY44, and TcWRKY47 significantly increased at 3\\\\u2009h, reaching 12.1, 11.0, 2.6, 11.2, 16.5, and 10.1 times, respectively. Meanwhile, at 6\\\\u2009h, their expression levels decreased in varying degrees, with only TcWRKY20 and TcWRKY47 remaining >2 times higher than the control. Moreover, TcWRKY52 was insensitive to MeJA treatment (Fig. 6a). TcWRKY8, TcWRKY20, TcWRKY26, TcWRKY41, and TcWRKY52 were significantly inhibited at 6\\\\u2009h after SA treatment. By contrast, although TcWRKY44 and TcWRKY47 were reduced at 3\\\\u2009h, they were significantly enhanced at 6\\\\u2009h by 3.3 and 4.8 times, respectively (Fig. 6b). Overall, only TcWRKY44 and TcWRKY47 were induced by MeJA and SA treatments. According to previous reports, Group IId and IIe were grouped together as Group IId\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009e and verified to function redundantly in other plants. Therefore, TcWRKY44 was selected for further studies to test the functions of Group IId\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009e WRKYs on taxol biosynthesis. Then, six TcWRKYs were overexpressed in the T. chinensis cell lines. Our previous research verified W-box as the key cis-element of promoters of DBAT and T5H. TcERF12 and TcERF15, which encode regulators of taxol biosynthesis, also contain W-boxes in their promoters (unpublished work). When these TcWRKYs are overexpressed, the expression levels of DBAT, T5H, TcERF12, and TcERF15 change in varying degrees (Fig. 7). TcWRKY8, TcWRKY20, TcWRKY47, and TcWRKY26 could increase the expression levels of the DBAT (3.1, 2.7, 5.4, and 2.2 times), T5H (4.6, 2.8, 4.1, and 1.5 times), and TcERF15 (3.2, 4.7, 5.5, and 1.4 times) genes. However, only TcWRKY20 and TcWRKY26 could also increase TcERF12 by 2.8 times. By contrast, TcWRKY47 and TcWRKY8 inhibit TcERF12 by 0.4 and 0.8 times, respectively. Meanwhile, TcWRKY44 and TcWRKY52 inhibit the expression levels of the DBAT (0.7 and 0.2 times), T5H (0.4 and 0.3 times), and TcERF12 (0.5 and 0.4 times) genes significantly. TcERF15 is also downregulated by 0.3 times in TcWRKY44-overexpressing cell lines but upregulated by 2.0 times in TcWRKY52-overexpressing cell lines. The results show that the overexpression of different TcWRKYs exerts different effects on the expression of taxol-biosynthesis-related genes.\\', \\'ref_47:Trichothecenes are one of the major groups of secondary metabolites produced by species of the genus Fusarium and covering more than 200 compounds. The chemical structure and the possible biosynthesis pathways of trichothecenes are relatively well known. Several questions regarding the toxicity mechanisms of trichothecenes remain unanswered, but some of these mechanisms have been identified in eukaryotes. Trichothecenes are cyclic terpenoids which can be further subdivided into simple and macrocyclic forms. Simple trichothecenes are a family of tetracyclic or tricyclic sesquiterpenes with various substituents. FHB is caused mainly by F. graminearum and F. culmorum which produce type B trichothecenes—DON with its acetylated derivatives, 3-acetyl-DON (3-Ac-DON) and 15-acetyl-DON (15-Ac-DON), and nivalenol (NIV). Fungi that are less frequently noted on cereal spikes include F. sporotrichioides and F. poae which produce type-A trichothecenes-T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin. Type-B trichothecenes suppress appetite, induce vomiting and weaken the immune system. T-2 toxin and other type-A trichothecenes damage the skin and mucous membranes, promote vomiting and diarrhea, suppress appetite, lead to hemorrhaging and neurological disorders. Trichothecenes often disrupt life processes in mammalian cells. These metabolites cause various human and animal diseases classified as mycotoxicoses. Goossens et al. demonstrated that the intake of feed contaminated with 903 ± 85 μg kg−1 of T-2 toxin inhibited the activity of porcine liver enzymes within 14 days. At the cellular level, trichothecenes disrupt nucleic acid synthesis, mitochondrial function, membrane integrity, and cell division. Trichothecenes may also induce apoptosis in animal cells. DON and T-2 toxin bind to the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome and block protein synthesis. The biosynthesis of trichothecenes begins with the cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to form trichodiene, which then undergoes a series of oxygenation, isomerization, cyclization, and esterification reactions to form T-2 toxin, NIV, or DON. The transformation pathway was described in a previous study. Proteins that participate in the biosynthesis of trichothecenes are encoded by TRI1-TRI16 genes grouped in three clusters. F. graminearum sensu stricto and F. sporotrichioides were the first model species where the main TRI cluster was characterized. In both species, the main TRI cluster is composed of 12 genes responsible for the synthesis and modification of the trichothecene skeleton. The cluster can include seven genes (TRI8, TRI7, TRI3, TRI4, TRI5, TRI11, TRI13) encoding enzymes that catalyze 10 trichothecene biosynthetic reactions, two genes (TRI6 and TRI10) encoding transcriptional regulators, one gene (TRI12) encoding a transport protein, and two genes (TRI9 and TRI14) with uncertain functions. Both species have two additional TRI loci: the single gene TRI101 locus encoding C-3 acetyltransferase and a locus containing two genes—TRI1 encoding C-8 oxygenase and TRI16 encoding C-8 acetyltransferase. An analysis of the fungal genome revealed that those loci are positioned on different chromosomes. The presence of the TRI5 gene, which encodes the enzyme participating in the isomerization and cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate to trichodiene in Fusarium isolates, determines their ability to produce trichothecenes. The chemotypes of Fusarium isolates can be determined by analyzing the polymorphism of TRI3, TRI7, TRI12, and TRI13 genes in the main TRI cluster and TRI1 in additional TRI loci containing genes responsible for the synthesis of various types of trichothecenes. For example, the development of the NIV chemotype of F. graminearum requires the expression of TRI7 and TRI13 genes, whereas their absence leads to the development of the DON chemotype. TRI1 was verified to be responsible for the difference in hydroxylation at C-8 and allows to distinguish DON chemotypes from chemotypes defined as NX. The NX chemotypes due to the lack of a ketone group at C-8 are classified as type-A trichothecenes.The most common biologically-modified products of DON are DOM-1, 3-epi-DON, and 3-keto DON (Figure 2a). The modification products of T-2 toxin that are most frequently described in literature include HT-2 toxin, T-2 triol, T-2 tetraol, neosolaniol (NEO), 3-acetyl T-2 toxin, and 4-deoxy T-2 toxin (Figure 2b). Trichothecenes are modified by acetylation, deacetylation, de-epoxidation, epimerization, glucosylation, and oxidation. Trichothecene modification products are generally described as less toxic for humans and animals. In a study by Pierron et al., bacterial de-epoxidation or epimerization of DON altered the interaction between the mycotoxin and the ribosome, which prevented the activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and reduced toxicity. At the cellular and subcellular level, DON exerts toxic effects by binding to the ribosome, which inhibits the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids, triggers ribotoxic stress, activates kinases, MAPKs, and their downstream signaling pathways. The products of DON’s microbiological modification do not activate this pathway, which eliminates symptoms of acute or chronic poisoning in humans and animals. Mycotoxin glucosides in plants are referred to as masked mycotoxins because they are not always detected with the use of the existing analytical methods and may be hydrolyzed during digestion in animals or humans. Analytical methods based on liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) are widely used for the determination of mycotoxins and their plant metabolites. Many plant biotransformation products of mycotoxins are difficult to detect by conventional analytical methods, and no regulatory limits have been set for them in food commodities. Trichothecene glucosides have been isolated from Fusarium infected plant material. The group of masked mycotoxins comprises not only some specific mycotoxins, such as DON and zearalenone, but also other Fusarium mycotoxins. DON degradation is observed in aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Aerobic bacteria degrade the mycotoxin by oxidation to 3-keto DON with isomerization to 3-epi DON. Anaerobic bacteria and aerobic bacteria decompose DON by de-epoxidation to DOM-1 (Table 2). Soil from arable fields, water, cereal leaves and spikes can act as reservoirs of bacterial strains with the above properties. Bacteria isolated from soil where Fusarium-infected cereals were grown can rapidly degrade DON, but only on selected media and within a broad range of temperatures (12–40 °C) and pH (6.0–7.5), which suggests that those microorganisms could be applied in cereal production in temperate and warmer climates. Bacteria of the genera Nocardioides and Devosia can degrade DON to 3-epi-DON and 3-keto DON. After seven days of incubation, Nocardioides bacterial strains isolated from wheat rhizosphere degraded 90% of DON to 3-epi-DON and two unidentified compounds in seven days. In a study by Sato et al., 13 tested bacterial isolates of the genera Nocardioides and Devosia degraded DON at a concentration of 100 μg mL–1 to concentrations below the limit of detection (0.5 µg mL–1). According to the cited authors, the application of the tested isolates led to the production of various metabolites, which points to the cooperative catabolism of DON in the environment: the biodegradation products of one isolate were degraded by another isolate. According to Ito et al., bacteria of the genus Marmoricola obtained from wheat spikes sprayed with DON or inoculated with F. graminearum effectively reduced DON contamination levels in wheat and barley grain. The cited studies demonstrated for the first time that bacteria of the genus Marmoricola are capable of degrading DON. They also revealed that Marmoricola strains can be effectively used to reduce DON levels in feeds containing wheat and barley grain. Cserháti et al. reported that 32 isolates of Rhodococcus bacteria were capable of degrading a broad range of mycotoxins, including trichothecenes. The mechanism that was implicated, but not proven, in the degradation process was the high metabolic activity of bacteria containing large nucleoids and linear megaplasmids. These structures encode for oxidases and other enzymes which enable bacteria to compete for energy and carbon derived from organic compounds. In the above study, the concentrations of T-2 toxin were reduced already 24 h after the bacterial suspension had been introduced to the substrate. The trichothecene-degrading potential of bacteria from cropped soil can be utilized to protect crops or introduce genetic modifications to cereals to increase their resistance to pathogens of the genus Fusarium. The introduction of Biomin® BBSH 797 for detoxifying trichothecenes in animal feed was a commercial success on the EU market. This product contains bacterial strain Eubacterium BBSH 797 which is isolated from bovine rumen fluid and has the ability to degrade several trichothecenes. In recent years, bacterial consortia have been used to transform Fusarium mycotoxins. Ahad et al. demonstrated that a bacterial consortium containing low levels of Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, including Alkaliphilus crotonatoxidans, Bacillus spp. and Blautia coccoides, the aerobic species of Stenotrophomonas (Gram-negative), was highly effective in de-epoxidizing eleven trichothecene mycotoxins. They suggested that the soil-derived bacterial consortium contained more than 30% of unidentified bacterial species. The bacterial consortium was characterized by a rapid and stable ability to de-epoxidize DON after 48 h of incubation. Vanhoutte et al. developed a biological test involving Lemna minor L. which is eliminated under exposure to DON concentrations higher than 1 mg L−1. When microorganisms derived from soil and activated sludge were incorporated into a macronutrient solution for plant growth, DON concentrations of 5 and 50 mg L−1 were effectively neutralized and modified. In addition, the metabolites 3-epi-DON and the epimer of de-epoxy-DON (3-epi-DOM-1) were found as biotransformation products of both consortia. Trichothecenes are toxic for eukaryotic fungal cells, therefore, fungi producing those mycotoxins have developed mechanisms that protect them against the harmful effects of trichothecenes. In the cells of Fusarium pathogens, trichothecenes are biosynthesized by intermediate products of C-3 acetylation, where acetylation is controlled by TRI101 and TRI201 genes encoding trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase. Acetylation of C-3 carbon (DON ⇒ 3-Ac-DON) reduces DON toxicity. Under exposure to trichothecenes, the activity of trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase was also reported in the cells of fungi of the genera Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, Blastobotrys, and Trichomonascus which do not produce those compounds. Yeasts belonging to the Trichomonascus clade can degrade T-2 toxin in three ways: by acetylating C-3 carbon, by hydrolyzing the isovaleric group, or by glycosylating C-3 carbon. All three biotransformation products—3-acetyl T-2 toxin, NEO and T-2 toxin glucoside—are significantly less toxic than T-2 toxin. Interestingly, in the group of the 23 analyzed species of yeasts capable of converting T-2 toxin to 3-acetyl T-2 toxin, only three species of Blastobotrys muscicola, B. robertii, B. peoriensis converted T-2 toxin to T-2 toxin 3-glucoside through glycosylation, whereas Trichomonascus petatosporus and four species of the genus Blastobotrys transformed T-2 toxin to two compounds: 3-acetyl T-2 toxin and NEO. Filamentous fungi such as Alternaria alternata, Rhizopus microsporus var. rhizopodiformis and Aspergillus oryzae metabolized DON into hydrolyzable conjugated DON. He et al. demonstrated that Aspergillus tubingensis (strain NJA-1) was capable of hydrolyzing DON, but the metabolites participating in this process and the underlying mechanism of action have not been identified. Kosawang et al. studied the hyperparasitic fungus Clonostachys rosea IK726, which is resistant to DON, and demonstrated that the fungus produces several synergistic proteins to activate a number of defense mechanisms against the toxin. A more detailed study revealed that DON induces a transcriptome representing genes that encode metabolic enzymes in C. rosea cells, including cytochrome P450 oxidase, cytochrome c oxidase, and stress proteins. The ThiJ/PfpI protein family was most strongly induced in the group of proteins activated by DON. Genes encoding other stress proteins were also expressed under the influence of DON. A recent study by Tian et al. demonstrated that fungi of the genus Trichoderma have the same defense mechanisms as plants when exposed to F. graminearum, where DON is degraded to D3G.\\', \\'ref_48:Based on the previous results, the main focus was on the eutectic consisting of terpene compounds because only such ones previously enabled sufficient chromatographic efficiency regarding the investigated working solution. Recently, multiple new DESs based on terpenoids emerged. They can be found both in scientific papers and in professional (mostly industry-orientated) databases. However, none of those DESs was tested as a component of a TLC mobile phase up to date. In the experiment, the inclusion parameters for the primary DES were: at least one of the compounds should be a terpenoid, and the second component should be a nature-occurring molecule. Furthermore, the best performing of the previously investigated hydrophobic DESs were included (E4, E9, E13). All the selected primary DESs (E1–E13, Table 1) could be described as hydrophobic and belonging to the type-V eutectic solvents. Additionally, some choline chloride-based DESs (type-III, hydrophilic) were included as possible polar modifiers of the mobile phases (E14–E17). Considering that in the last experiment, the combination of choline chloride (ChCl) with sugars resulted in excessive viscosity, this time, organic acids and phenol were selected as a co-eutectics. A detailed explanation of other preferable parameters in selecting DES, such as low viscosity or stability during the chromatographic process is discussed in the previous article. All the investigated DESs are gathered in Table 1.Where possible, the molar ratio of eutectic mixtures was based on literature data. In the absence of such information, the default equimolar ratio was applied. The preferred obtaining procedure was P1, as it is considered to be the simplest and most sparing; in the case of not forming the stable and homogenous liquid, P2 was applied. Solvent-mediated liquefaction (P3) was treated as the last resort. According to the literature, the differences in the obtaining method do not affect DES properties.During the optimization procedure, it was observed that the visualization of bands could be substantially improved by heating the developed plates. NADES are generally perceived as non-volatile liquids, and the information is repeated in numerous articles (—to name only a few). Most likely, the claim is valid mainly for the sugar-, sugar alcohol- and amino acid-based DES. Given that terpenes are generally volatile, it was expected that DESs composed thereof might also share the feature. The assumption was supported by the observation that terpene-based DESs are fragrant. The literature data confirms the volatility of the mentioned eutectic liquids. Therefore, it was checked if heating could remove mobile phase leftovers from the chromatographic plate. The results showed that heating over 100 °C allows at least partial evaporation of the mobile phase, but the best results were achieved by heating the plate at 150 °C for 5 min. After the procedure, the plates were “dry” and practically odorless. However, traces of mobile phase leftovers were still detectable at 254 nm due to the fluorescence indicator in plates, even when prolonged time (up to 2 h) or increased temperature (up to 200 °C) was used. That can be considered a limitation in the use of eutectic TLC. However, at 366 nm, no interferences were visually observed. Based on the results presented above, an additional attempt was made to spray-derivatize the heated plate with the Draggendorf’s reagent to determine if spray-derivatization is possible in eutectic TLC. The procedure was successful; orange bands were formed as expected, but the derivatization was not included in the final protocol. The optimized system underwent validation according to the ICH guidelines. Validation details are presented in the supplementary material (Table S1). The obtained results draw attention to the linearity range, which starts from 1 ng of pure compound per band. This value is many times lower than the already-existing classic TLC method for quantification of the investigated alkaloids. The optimized method was subsequently tested with the real sample obtained from the Chelidonium maius herb and proved to be efficient. The content of the five investigated alkaloids is presented in Table 4.The amount of the investigated alkaloids is comparable to the results found in the literature data, which provides additional confirmation that eutectic TLC is a valuable alternative to conventional TLC.In the preliminary results, the development time was limiting the usefulness of the eutectic TLC—in the case of a single analysis, times reaching two hours were not acceptable for a routine procedure. However, the issue was successfully overcome by choosing optimal DES selected from a growing number of possibilities, just as predicted in the previous article. Thus, one of the most serious limitations of the method was avoided. Moreover, post-development heating of plates allowed for minimization of the plate impregnation effect by mobile phase leftovers in the case of terpene-based DESs. That, in turn, enabled attempts of spray-derivatization, which further increases the functionality of eutectic TLC. From what it seems now, eutectic chromatography would improve separation possibilities compared to traditional TLC due to additional interactions with a eutectic matrix. It suggests that the eutectic TLC may be a good choice for difficult samples compared to already existing complicated approaches, such as multigradient or 2D TLC. Furthermore, eutectic solvents as mobile phases do not require high investment because creating a DES in most cases is extremely simple (requires just mixing or/and heating). Thus, eutectic TLC gives new separation opportunities without creating an exclusionary equipment barrier.\\', \\'ref_49:1. introduction Terpenoids are the most structurally diverse family of natural products (NPs) and are widely distributed in all kingdoms of life. They are close to human life and have various applications as flavours (e.g. menthol), food colourants (e.g. carotenoids) and medicines (e.g. the antimalarial agent artemisinin and the antimitotic agent Taxol) [[1\\\\\\\\]](#page-9-0). Terpenoids are constructed from five-carbonisoprene units, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate, through head-to-tail coupling reactions and to give linear C5n isoprene diphosphates as activated precursors. The diverse scaffolds of terpenoids, with multiple rings and stereogenic centres, are generated via a multi-step cyclization cascade of linear C5n isoprene substrates by terpene synthases (TPSs) [\\\\\\\\[2](#page-9-0)]. Over decades, two classes of canonical TPSs have been categorized according to their protein sequences, enzymatic structures and functional mechanisms on how the initial carbocation is © 2023 The Authors.

Class I TPSs catalyse ionization-initiated cyclization to generate a carbocation by leaving a pyrophosphate group through the conserved DDxxD/E motif. Class II TPSs initiate cyclization by protonation of a double-bond or epoxide moiety in an isoprene substrate via the conserved DxDD (DxDTT) motif. In recent years, there have been a growing number of non-canonical TPSs that catalyse TPS-like cyclization, in which the enzymes differ in sequence or structure from the canonical TPSs; however, like the canonical TPSs, they catalyse cyclization through the generation of carbocation by taking isoprene-derived molecules as precursors [[4](#page-9-0)]. Exploring and characterizing new non-canonical TPSs will provide more insights for enzymatic tools to generate chemical and structural diversity and to understand how these enzymes evolve for terpenoid biosynthesis.The 50 μl reaction mixture contained 100 mg ml−1 microsomal fractions of Tps1H, 100 μM compound 1, 2 mM NADPH, NADPH regeneration system (Corning Gentest™) (2.5 μl of solution A and 0.5 μl of solution B), 5 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The reactions were incubated for 16 h at 30°C and were then extracted by ethyl acetate (100 μl × 3). The extracts were evaporated, dissolved in methanol and analysed by LC-MS. The 50 μl scale reaction mixture contained 10 μM Tps1D, 2 μM 5 and 100 μM S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The reactions were incubated for 16 h at 30°C and were then extracted by ethyl acetate (100 μl × 3). The extracts were evaporated, dissolved in methanol and analysed by LC-MS.\\', \\'ref_50:Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the modifications of biologically active compounds, ranging from small molecules, such as camphor, to bulky fatty acids and carotenoids. These biological modifications, which mainly include monooxygenation, have been found to be beneficial for humans and other species. In the human body, CYPs play an important role in the production and metabolism of hormones, such as estrogen, testosterone, cholesterol, and vitamin D, and metabolize various drugs (e.g., bilirubin) that are poisonous to humans. Another notable feature of CYPs is their ability to transform medically useful polyketide peptides from polyketide synthases (PKSs), which may expand the diversity of small-molecule libraries for drug-discovery screening. The pharmaceutical industry has focused on this exceptional property of CYPs to change the biological activity and physical properties of compounds. The modification of an inactivated C-H bond by CYPs may increase the solubility of compounds and convert them into active forms. More than 1000 bacterial CYPs have been discovered and divided into approximately 150 families according to sequence similarity. Bacterial CYPs have many advantages as biocatalysts. As indicated above, bacterial CYPs are composed of diverse homologues; even one bacterial genome can possess several homologues, indicating that bacterial CYPs can modify a vast range of substrates. Unlike their eukaryotic counterparts, bacterial CYPs are soluble and can be obtained at a much higher yield. Moreover, it is known that bacterial CYPs are more active than those from eukaryotes. However, bacterial CYPs have also shown disadvantages, such as the inaccurate region and/or stereo-selectivity of modifications and thermolabile properties.Biochemical and structural studies have investigated and revealed that, although the primary protein structure for bacterial CYPs is not conserved, the secondary and tertiary structures of CYPs are similar to each other. Sequence alignment studies have shown that the substrate recognition sites (SRSs) composed of five loops are neither conserved nor structurally rigid with various amino acid sequences. The substrate selectivity or preference among diverse substrates of CYPs is thought to be overcome with highly flexible loops and divergent sequences around SRSs. However, the distinct rules for the structure-based substrate recognition of CYPs remain unclear. In the CYP101 family, there are nine CYPs that are mostly from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans DSM12444 and Sphingobium yanoikuyae B2, except for CYP101A1 (P450cam), which is from Pseudomonas putida, and CYP101D3, which is from Sphingomonas sp. SKA58. CYP101D1, CYP101D2, and CYP101A1 catalyze the oxidation of camphor, while CYP101B1 and CYP101C1 use ionone as a substrate. Although intensive structural studies have been conducted, the selectivity between these two substrates of the CYP101 family has not been fully elucidated. It is, therefore, necessary to analyze diverse CYP structures to better understand the mechanisms underlying substrate recognition. In this study, we report the biochemical characterization and crystal structure of CYP101D5 from Sphingomonas echinoides at a resolution of 3.2 Å. We explored the oxidation of terpenes and flavonoids by CYP101D5. The characterization of the products indicated that CYP101D5 hydroxylates and dehydrogenates various substrates. A structural analysis and comparison among the CYP101 subfamilies showed substrate-dependent residues and surface charge distribution at the substrate binding cavity. The results presented in this paper provide valuable structural information for selecting CYPs to modify or produce biologically important compounds.\\', \\'ref_51:The catalytic mechanisms of terpene synthases share several common characteristics. Catalytic reactions of terpene synthases are multistep cascade reactions with multiple carbocation intermediates and carbocation rearrangements occur through a 1,2-hydride shift and/or alkyl shift to form new skeleton backbone products. Class II terpene synthases have the characteristic DXDD motif in which the middle aspartic acid generally acts as the catalytic acid that initiates the reaction by protonation, and the catalytic base is variable. The mechanisms underlying class II diTPSs resemble other terpene synthase reaction mechanisms, but also have their own characteristics. In plants, three stereoisomers of CPPs are all obtained via the intermediate labda-13E-en-8-yl+, whose stereochemistry depends on the pro-chiral conformation of the substrate GGPP. However, due to the absence of syn-CPS structure, the specific structural and mechanistic differences in the diterpene synthases that produce the three stereochemically distinct CPPs remain to be elucidated. For example, while class II diTPSs usually deprotonate directly, they also terminate by capturing a water molecule. Two studies investigating the histidine-asparagine dyad in ent-CPP producing diterpene synthase (ent-CPS) and tyrosine-histidine dyad in (+)-CPP producing diterpene synthase ((+)-CPS) show that mutating histidine to alanine produces hydroxylated derivatives of CPPs. Another study, however, found that changing the corresponding histidine (H251) to alanine in syn-CPS OsCyc1 did not alter its product to hydroxylated CPP. Due to the lack of structural information for syn-CPSs, there is no structural explanation for why OsCyc1-related amino acid mutations do not produce hydroxylated CPPs. In addition, the common or individual mechanisms of different stereochemical CPPs producing CPSs remain elusive.The crystal structure of plant ent-CPS from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCPS) complexed with a substrate analog revealed the substrate binding mode for ent-CPS. The apo state structure of abietadiene synthase from Abies grandis (AgAs) and substrate binding mode structure of miltiradiene synthase from Selaginella moellendorffii (SmMDS) showed the structures of (+)-CPSs. However, the structure of plant syn-CPS remains absent. Here, we set out to uncover the structure of OsCyc1 and explore structural and mechanistic differences in CPSs that produce stereochemically different CPPs using structural biology, mass spectrometry, molecular docking, and bioinformatics methods. In summary, we solved the crystal structure of wild-type OsCyc1, together with three cryo-EM structures of OsCyc1 in different oligomeric forms and a cryo-EM structure of the OsCyc1D367A mutant in complex with the substrate GGPP. Importantly, we obtained a mutant that produces ent-CPP in addition to the primary product syn-CPP.\\', \\'ref_52:The distribution of PgOSC genes on nine chromosomes in Platycodon grandiflorus was predicted based on gene assembly information published previously. Not all chromosomes of Platycodon grandiflorus, PgOSC family genes are specifically distributed across only five chromosomes, including four OSC genes on chromosomes 2 and 8, five OSC genes on chromosome 4, and only one OSC gene each on chromosomes 2 and 7 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, PgOSC genes are predominantly distributed in the form of gene clusters on the chromosomes of Platycodon grandiflorus. The gene clusters on chromosomes 4 and 8 contain up to four paralogous OSC genes, whereas the two gene clusters situated on chromosome 1 comprise only two members each. The clustering distribution of PgOSC family genes implies their functional similarity, indicating that they may share common biological roles and regulatory mechanisms.To explore the phylogenetic relationships between the OSC proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA7 software using OSC proteins sequence from A. thaliana (six), S. barbata (five), Platycodon grandifloras (15), T. coreanum (five), Panax ginseng (12), respectively. A total of 43 OSC protein sequences, originating from five diverse species, were categorized into four distinct subfamilies (Fig. 2). Four OSC proteins belonged to the subfamily I are all from A. thaliana, these may be related to the different evolutionary directions of A. thaliana and medicinal plants. Subfamily III contains the largest number of PgOSC proteins (six) and a small amount of proteins from other species. In addition, subfamily II encompasses 14 proteins, while subfamily IV comprises 16 proteins and the majority of which originate from Platycodon grandiflorus and Panax ginseng.To elucidate the collinear relationship among OSC family gene species, we conducted a collinearity analysis employing the genomes of A. thaliana, Panax ginseng, S. miltiorrhiza, and Platycodon grandiflorus. Within this analysis, the OSC family members were emphasized through the utilization of red lines. As shown in Fig. 3, There is no collinearity between the OSC genes of Platycodon grandiflorus and A. thaliana, suggesting that they may not have a common ancestral gene. However, both Panax ginseng and S. miltiorrhiza, renowned for their medicinal properties, exhibit a distinct collinear relationship with Platycodon grandiflorus, such as PgOSC15 (PGRA_01400, Chr 2) in Platycodon grandiflorus and EVM0005942.1 (Chr 5) and EVM0039524.1 (Chr 12) in Panax ginseng; PgOSC9 (PGRA_07650 Chr 4) in Platycodon grandiflorus and EVM0056770.1 (Chr 3) and EVM0062132.1 (Chr 19)in Panax ginseng. These findings suggest that the OSC family genes of medicinal plants, including Platycodon grandiflorus, Panax ginseng, and S. miltiorrhiza, are more intimately related in the evolutionary process compared to those of A. thaliana. Unfortunately, hampered by the limitations of incomplete genomic data available in public databases, we were unable to carry out an intra-species collinearity analysis of Platycodon grandiflorus.In order to reveal the structural characteristics of PgOSC family genes, we analyzed the exon–intron structures and the conserved motifs of 15 PgOSC genes using the MEME online tool and TBtools software. As shown in Fig. 4A, All 15 PgOSC proteins shared seven common motifs (motif 1 to motif 7), Motif 8 is present in all PgOSC gene family, with the exception of pgosc15. The exon-intron structures of PgOSC genes were analyzed by the CDS and genome sequences. As shown in Fig. 4B, The OSC family genes of Platycodon grandiflorus typically exhibit intricate gene structures, characterized by diverse combinations of numerous exons and introns. The length of PgOSC family genes surpasses 10 kb, excluding PgOSC2, PgOSC7, and PgOSC10. The extended intron structure accounts for the augmented gene length and implied that these genes may undergo more extensive differentiation and accumulate longer-term variations, thereby elevating the recombination frequency during OSC gene replication. This phenomenon is conducive to the evolution of organisms. However, given the intricate nature of the gene structure, it is imperative to take into account the quality of the database. This necessitates the corroboration of sequencing results from diverse sources to ensure the reliability of the data.In order to further study the characteristics of tertiary structure of OSC protein in Platycodon grandiflorus, we conducted homology modeling analysis using the SWISS-MODE online tool. As shown in Fig. 5, The fundamental structure of OSC protein comprises a small β-fold block that is enclosed within two dense clusters of α-helices and the irregular curl shuttling through it seem to maintain the stability of the entire structure. Within the PgOSC family, significant variations in the number of central β-sheets exist among different members, potentially influencing the functional properties of these proteins. Furthermore, the stereoscopic structure of PgOSC12 and PgOSC13 distinctly differs from other members in Platycodon grandiflorus, consisting of a unique complex that integrates four fundamental PgOSC structures. Determining whether this distinctive architecture indeed bestows PgOSC12 and PgOSC13 with superior catalytic efficiency necessitates meticulous experimental validation.To obtain the predictive information of subcellular localization of PgOSC family proteins in Platycodon grandiflorus, we utilized the protein sequence of PgOSC to predict its subcellular localization using the WOLF PSORT website. The subcellular localization prediction of PgOSC family members are shown by heatmap. As shown in Fig. 6, Through clustering analysis, it becomes evident that PgOSC proteins exhibit three distinct patterns of subcellular distribution within cells. One pattern involves localization in mitochondria and peroxisomes, encompassing PgOSC1, PgOSC4, PgOSC13. Another pattern is found in the cytoplasm and nucleus, with high credibility in prediction results, such as PgOSC2, PgOSC5, PgOSC7 PgOSC11, PgOSC12, PgOSC15. Lastly, the remaining PgOSC family members are distributed across chloroplasts, vacuoles, Golgi apparatus, and other organelles.Cis-elements are important for gene transcription, to acquire information of the Cis-elements on PgOSC gene promoters , a 2000 bp DNA sequence upstream of each gene translation start site extracted from the Platycodon grandiflorus genome database were used to make a prediction through the PlantCARE website (Fig. 7). A moderate level of adversity can promote the accumulation of secondary metabolites. We found that the PgOSC family contains a rich set of cis-acting elements that respond to drought, low temperature, and hypoxia, which are beneficial for the accumulation of triterpenoids. In addition, hormone response elements involved in auxins, abscisic acid, gibberellins, and jasmonic acid indicate that hormones remain important factors in regulating the growth and development of Platycodon grandiflorus and the accumulation of secondary metabolites. Details of cis-acting elements in the promoter region of PgOSC genes shown in Table S4.To ascertain the tissue expression pattern of PgOSCs, we employed qRT-PCR to assess the expression levels of PgOSC family genes across leaf, steam, root, and root beard of Platycodon grandiflorus. As expected, the expression level of PgOSC family genes was higher in the roots of Platycodon grandiflorus than in its stem, leaf and root beard tissues. There was no significant difference in the expression of OSC family genes between stems and leaves (except PgOSC8) (Fig. 8) . These results suggest that The root of Platycodon grandiflorus may function as the primary site for triterpenoids synthesis, which aligns with the utilization of the root specifically for medicinal purposes, rather than other tissues of the plant.Moderate stress conditions can stimulate the accumulation of secondary metabolites in plants.To clarify the relationship between the synthesis of triterpenoids in Platycodon grandiflorus and stress conditions, we subjected one-year-old plants to various types of stress treatments, including heat, drought, and salt. Subsequently, we used qRT-PCR to detect changes in the expression of PgOSC genes. Excitingly, salt stress emerged as a prominent factor, exhibiting a robust induction effect on most genes of the PgOSC family (excluding PgOSC3, PgOSC8, PgOSC15) (Fig. 9). This result suggests that salt stress effectively promotes the accumulation of triterpenoids in Platycodon grandiflorus. In addition, drought stress specifically induced the expression of PgOSC14 and PgOSC15.Triterpenoids are compounds that commonly occur in plants, either in their free state or combined with sugars in the form of glycosides or esters. Possessing a diverse array of biological activities, they serve as pivotal effective components in numerous Chinese medicinal materials. For instance, ginsenosides possess the ability to foster protein biosynthesis, modulate metabolic functions, strengthen immune responses, and effectively suppress tumor growth. The multifaceted functionalities of saikosaponin encompass its potent anti-inflammatory properties, along with its capability to effectively reduce cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in the plasma. Aescin possesses anti-exudative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-congestion properties, thereby exhibiting significant therapeutic potential in addressing a range of physiological conditions. Glycyrrhizin exhibits adrenocortical hormone-mimetic effects, and exhibits prophylactic potential against liver cirrhosis, atherosclerosis, and ulceration. OSC family genes encode oxidized squalene cyclase, a pivotal enzyme serving as a branching point in the biosynthetic pathways of sterols and a diverse array of saponins within organisms. OSC possesses the remarkable ability to catalyze the formation of sterol or triterpene skeletons, characterized by their distinct parent ring structures, and subsequently, through a cascade of enzymatic reactions, these skeletons give rise to a plethora of functionally diverse compounds. In A. thaliana, a total of 13 OSC genes have been identified, all capable of catalyzing the synthesis of triterpenoid products. These products include cycloartenol, lanosterol, β-amyrin, marneral, thalianol, and arabidiol, demonstrating the diverse biosynthetic capabilities of these enzymes within the plant species. Heterologous expression of OSC genes in Oryza sativa leads to the synthesis of a range of products, including β-amyrin, parkeol, and isoarborinol, among others.\\', \"ref_53:Earlier we had reported that a multiproduct terpene synthase MtTPS5 (Fig. 1) from Medicago truncatula produces 27 products from FDP.11,12 We had also previously proposed the complex mechanistic pathway controlled by the MtTPS5 using a combination of techniques including labelling experiments.11 In brief, the reaction cascade is initiated by the formation of a highly reactive farnesyl carbocation by the disassociation of diphosphate moiety. The C1 to C11 ring closure affords the humulyl cation, which generates terpenoids such as α-humulene and β-caryophyllene (Scheme 1). Most of the products require the initial C1 to C10 closure generating the germacren-11-yl cation which is further cyclized to products like germacrene D and germacrenyl based alcohols. The other key cationic intermediates are (2Z,6E)-germacren-1-yl cation and cadinan-7-yl cation, leading to about 80% of products. These intermediates are generated by isomerization of FDP to nerolidyl diphosphate (NDP). Even alteration of a single amino acid has a dramatic effect on the product profile; alteration of tyrosine to phenylalanine in MtTPS5 prevents the formation of a key intermediate via protonation of germacrene D. The tight control of the enzyme leads to optically pure products resulting from cyclization steps and hydride shifts. Hence, it is of vital importance to understand the electrostatic interactions within active site. One possibility is to link the structure with complex catalytic cascade by using alternate substrates.13 Substrate analogues have been used successfully to probe the specificity of the enzymes and obtain a substrate-bound crystal structure of enzymes.14–16 Natural biosynthesis allows these substrates to carry only methyl substituents, but synthetic approaches can provide various analogues of the natural substrates. Especially, substitution with sulphur has been used quite successfully for co-crystallization with different terpene synthases.17,18 In a recent example from Heaps et al.,14 chlorinated substrates have been shown to be alternative co-substrates for farnesyl diphosphate synthase and also acting as inhibitors when both substrates were chlorinated. Fluorinated substrates have been successfully used to study the cyclization mechanism of several terpene synthases, in particular the aristolochene synthases.19 Thus, non-natural substrates have shown great potential as substrates or inhibitors to probe mechanisms and can be further utilized for the investigation of multiproduct terpene synthases.Based on the information obtained from mechanistic studies of MtTPS5,11 we have designed a set of functional analogues of prenyl diphosphates for this enzyme that could destabilize the developing allylic carbocation. The GDP analogue (3-BrGDP) and FDP analogue (3-BrFDP) (Fig. 2) were considered because of their geometrical similarity and virtually identical van der Waals radius and volume (ca. 2.0 Å,20 cf. also Fig. 6) with the methyl group at C3 position of natural substrates. The highly electronegative bromine atom can strongly influence the stability of the neighboring carbocationic species but imposes no additional steric effect in comparison with the corresponding natural substrates. These analogues could either provide novel sesquiterpenes that could be further utilized to investigate mechanistic aspects of the MtTPS5, or they could act as potent inhibitors of MtTPS5. In case of inhibition it can be used to provide an active site resolved crystal structure like in the case of aristolochene synthase with farnesyl-Sthiolodiphosphate.21 There is a lack of definitive understanding about the structure of multiproduct terpene synthases due to the absence of their crystal structures. These easy to synthesize inhibitors with identical sterical features could prove to be valuable tool for understanding the complex cyclization sequences in the active sites of these terpene cyclases.Protein expression Strains of E. coli (BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)) with recombinant vectors of MtTPS512 and N-terminal His8-tag were grown to A600 = 0.5 at 37 °C in LB-medium with kanamycin (50 μg ml−1). After induction with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), cultures were shaken overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and incubated with lysozyme. After disruption of the cells by sonication, cell debris were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was passed over a column of Ni2+-NTA-Agarose (QIAGEN, Germany), equilibrated with lysis buffer. After being washed twice with washing buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole), the protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole). The purified protein was desalted into a TRIS-buffer (50 mM TRIS, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) by passing through a NAP 25 column (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden), diluted to reach a concentration of 0.2 and 1 mg ml−1 and stored at −20 °C.Kinetic characterization of 3-bromo analogues as inhibitors of mttps5 For kinetic studies, terpene synthase activity was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm as a consequence of the consumption of NADPH coupled to the release of pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate was detected using a coupled-enzyme system supplied as a pyrophosphate reagent by Sigma-Aldrich. This reagent was reconstituted in buffer (16.7 mg in 1 ml 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8). Assay reaction mixtures were prepared in 96-well microplates with 50 μl of pyrophosphate reagent, 90 μl of buffer (0–16 μM inhibitor, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT) and 10 μl of various concentrations of FPP. Similarly, a blank reaction mixture without FPP (instead, 10 μl of buffer was used) was prepared, and both reaction mixtures were preheated at 30 °C for 5 min. Next, 5 μl of enzyme (0.2 mg ml−1) was added to both mixtures to start the reactions. The activity was determined as the difference between the decrease in absorbance per minute of the sample and of the blank. Apart from spectrophotometry based measurements, Assays (1 ml final volume) were initiated by addition of purified MTTPS5 solution (600 nM). Assays contained 0.1–5 μM farnesyl diphosphate, 0–3 μM inhibitor, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and were warmed to 30 °C prior to addition of enzyme solution. After incubation for 90 min. each assay was stopped by addition of 100 mM EDTA and 100 μL of pentane containing 1 ng μL−1 of dodecane as an internal standard to trap the reaction products. After vortexing for 10 s, the pooled hexane extracts were vortexed with silica (50 mg) the sample was centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 5 min and then the hexane was decanted into a vial and the activity quantified. KM and KM(app) values were determined by a nonlinear fit of the data to the equation V = Vmax[S]/(KM + [S]) using Origin 8G. Mode of action of the inhibitors was determined by examination of double reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[S]. Ki values were determined using plots of [I] versus KM(app) once each inhibitor was observed to be competitive.Synthetic procedure 2-((7-Methyloct-6-en-2-yn-1-yl)oxy)tetrahydro-2H-pyran (2a).34 The alkyne (2-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)tetrahydro-2H-pyran) (2.00 g, 14.3 mmol) was dissolved in dry DMI (20 ml). The solution was cooled to 0 °C, and n-butyllithium (1.39 M in hexanes, 10.3 ml, 14.3 mmol) was added by syringe over 15 min. Then stirred for 30 min, and further the 5-bromo-2-methylpent-2-ene 1a (2.00 g, 9.52 mmol) in dry DMI (10 ml) was added. The reaction was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 5 h. Sat. aq. NaCl (50 ml) was added and the solution was extracted with petroleum ether (3 × 50 ml). The combined organic phase was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacuo to give yellow oil which was heated to 70 °C under vacuum to distill off most of the excess alkyne. The remaining oil was chromatographed on silica gel (9 : 1 hexanes–diethyl ether) to give 1.264 g of 2a (63%) as a colorless oil data: (lit.34) 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 5.12–5.14 (1H, m), 4.79 (1H, t, J = 3.3 Hz), 4.22 (2H, app q), 3.79–3.85 (1H, m), 3.49–3.53 (1H, m), 2.17–2.21 (4H, m), 1.68 (3H, s), 1.60 (3H, s), 1.50–1.91 (6H, m); 13C NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 132.9, 122.8, 96.5, 86.4, 75.7, 61.9, 54.5, 30.2, 27.3, 24.6, 25.3, 19.3, 19.1, 17.7.

First step in synthesis (2E)-2-((7,11-dimethyldodeca-6,10-dien-2-yn-1-yl)oxy)tetrahydro-2H-pyran (2b) was the conversion of homogeraniol to (2E)-9-bromo-2,6-dimethylnona-2,6-diene (1b) by following procedure of Oehlschlager et al.35 (2E)-9-Bromo-2,6-dimethylnona-2,6-diene (1b).35 To an icecooled solution of triphenylphosphine (1.5 g, 5.5 mmol) in 10 mL of CH2C12, bromine was added dropwise until a permanent yellow color appeared. A few milligrams of triphenylphosphine were added to consume excess Br2 and then pyridine (0.8 mL, 10 mmol) was added and stirred for 10 min.

Furthermore, its solution-structure, despite extensive Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies, has provided little insight into its hydrogen-bonding behavior, thus far. Hydrogen-bonding interactions are often an important part of biological activity. In order to study these interactions, the structure of T-2 toxin was compared in both the solution- and solid-state using NMR Spectroscopy. It was determined that the solution- and solid-state structure differ dramatically, as indicated by differences in their carbon chemical shifts, these observations are further supported by solution proton spectral parameters and exchange behavior. The slow chemical exchange process and cross-relaxation dynamics with water observed between the hydroxyl hydrogen on C-3 and water supports the existence of a preferential hydrogen bonding interaction on the opposite side of the molecule from the epoxide ring, which is known to be essential for trichothecene toxicity. This result implies that these hydrogen-bonding interactions could play an important role in the biological function of T-2 toxin and posits towards a possible interaction for the trichothecene class of toxins and the ribosome. These findings clearly illustrate the importance of utilizing solid-state NMR for the study of biological compounds, and suggest that a more detailed study of this whole class of toxins, namely trichothecenes, should be pursued using this methodology.All of the one-dimensional 13C spectra of T-2 toxin are presented in Figure 6. The solution 13C-spectrum (Figure 5A) was assigned on the basis of chemical shifts and multiplicities determined by a series of distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) experiments (Data not shown), performed using 45°, 90°, and 135° observation pulses as described by Doddrell et al.. The heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum confirms both the proton and carbon assignments. Furthermore, the assignment of carbons without attached protons was confirmed by the heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) spectra. The carbon assignment and the cross-peaks of note in the HSQC and HMBC spectra are summarized in Table S5. The heteronuclear correlation methods allow for the unambiguous assignments of all the carbonyl resonances, including those of the carbonyl and methyl carbons of the acetyl side chains, which confirm the assignments previously identified by Savard and Blackwell.The solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) spectra, obtained by direct polarization (DP; Figure 6B) and cross polarization (CP; Figure 6C), were collected in approximately the same experimental time as the solution spectrum. While the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the DP spectrum is comparable to that of the solution-state spectrum, the S/N is much higher in the CP spectrum compared to either the solution or the DP spectra. It is remarkable that, although the resolution in the solution-state spectrum is expectedly better, the differences between the solid- and solution-state line-widths are as small as 4 Hz (as can observed in Figure 7). This exceptional resolution in the solid-state spectra was made possible by the fast spinning (22 kHz), the high power multiple pulse decoupling, as well as the microcrystallinity of the sample. Under less favorable conditions, line-widths of hundreds of Hz are not unusual. The most significant observation in solid-state, when compared with the solution data, is that all the carbon resonances are twinned. This is consistent with the findings of the X-ray study of T-2 toxin by Gilardi et al., where they observed two molecules in the unit cell that differ primarily in the confirmation of the isovalerate side-chain. No distinction can be made at this stage between which signals belong to which molecule, as no carbon-carbon correlation information is available, due to the low sensitivity of the natural abundance carbon signal, as well as the long T1 relaxation of carbon. A complete assignment will be possible once carbon chemical shift calculations using the Gauge Invariant Plane Augmented Wave (GIPAW) methodology, currently being implemented in our group using the ABINIT modeling environment, are combined with the carbon-carbon correlations provided by the time demanding 13C INADEQUATE experiments at natural abundance (which will be the subject of a future contribution).At this stage some very interesting observations can be made when comparing solution to solid carbon chemical shifts, as shown in Figure 8. There is no simple correspondence between the carbon chemical shifts of solution to those of the solids (i.e., no fixed difference in frequency), which suggests that they have significant differences in their conformations and in their immediate chemical environment. These differences in the carbon chemical shifts were reconciled through the analysis of close contacts observed in the X-ray structure from Gilardi et al.

The atmosphere was replaced with carbon monoxide and allylic chloride (3.3 mmol) in 5 ml of ethanol was added under CO. The reaction mixture was stirred at 25◦C for the reported time. The reaction was followed by GC. At the end of the reaction, the mixture was filtered and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel with hexane/AcOEt as eluent to provide the carbonylated product.One of the referee\\'s has commented on the fact that the observed optical activity of the carbonylation compound 6 arising from the allylic chloride 11 was lower than that coming from the carbonate 1, which would not be consistent with a complete retention of configuration. As a matter of fact, the synthesis of perillyl chloride from β-pinene has given in our hand a product whose specific rotation ([α] 20 D = −56◦) does not necessarily correspond to a homochiral compound, due to: (i) the nature of the starting β-pinene (ee = 93%) and (ii) to the stereochemistry of the opening into the perillyl chloride, for which there is no information about the retention of configuration in the original paper [17]. The only reference related to the specific rotation of perillyl chloride gives a specific rotation [α]D = −60◦ [18]. However, we feel that we cannot take this value into consideration to evaluate the purity of our chloride. In any case, if there were a racemization during the carbonylation of perillyl chloride, this process would imply necessarily the formation of an internal symmetrical π-allylic group and a subsequent isomerization into the external one and carbonylation (that correspond formally in Scheme 3 to the migration of the double bond from position 2–3 to 2–7). As it has been shown that the carbonylation of 12 occurs under the same conditions giving 7 and that this compound 7 has not been detected in the perillyl chloride carbonylation, this racemization process is to our opinion unlikely. Further studies will be made in due course to analyze the optical purity of 11 and generally speaking to the other related compounds, due to the lack of information in the literature. Although the reaction is different, it has been frequently reported that in Suzuki cross coupling reaction of aryl halide with aryl boronic acids catalyzed by Pd, totally different results are obtained according the nature of the countercation, when carbonate was used as base, however, no explanation has been given to rationalize this effect [22].\", \"ref_57:Illigerate F (1) was isolated as colorless oil and had a molecular formula of C19H24O3 on the basis of positive ESIMS (m/z 323.1612 [M þ Na]+, calculated for C19H24O3Na, 323.1623), indicating eight degrees of unsaturation.

In the NMR spectra, the carbons observed at dC 134.4 (s, C-1\\'), 128.1 (d, C-2\\' and 6\\'), 128.9 (d, C-3\\' and 5\\'), 130.3 (d, C-4\\'), combined with proton resonances at dH 7.46 (2H, m), 7.31 (3H, m) indicated a mono-substituted benzene ring. The NMR data of 1 showed the characteristic NMR features for a ester carbonyl (dC 166.9, s), a trans-double bond [dH 7.63 (1H, d, J ¼ 16.2 Hz, 6.39 (1H, d, J ¼ 16.2 Hz). 1,4 substituted cyclohexene was deduced from 1H-1H COSY correlations from H-2 [dH 5.74 (1H, brs)] to H-3 [dH 1.88 (2H, m)], H-3 to H-4 [dH 1.50 (1H, dddd, J ¼ 11.5, 10.2, 5.0, 2.3 Hz)], H-4 to H-5 [dH 1.91 (1H, m), 1.23 (1H, m)], and H-5 to H-6 [dH 2.09 (2H, m)]. Further comparison of NMR data of 1 with illigerate C (4), an analogue from the same plant, suggested 1 is the ester of a cinnamic acid and a monoterpene (Dong, Cai, Li, Wang, et al. [2017]). The main differences between the two compounds were that 1 has one more methylene while 4 has an oxymethine. The HMBC correlation from H-7 to C-9\\' (dC 166.9, s) suggested the cinnamic acid unit was linked to C-7, from H-9 and 10 to C-4 and C-8 indicated the two methyls was located at C-4. Hence, the planar structure of compound 1 was elucidated as (4-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl) cyclohex-1-enyl) methyl cinnamate. The relative configuration of 1 was deduced from the coupling constants in 1H NMR. The coupling constants of H-4/H-3ax (J ¼ 11.5 Hz) and H-4/H-5ax (J ¼ 10.2 Hz), both were axial–axial coupling constants, indicated that H-4 was located in axial position of the chair conformation for cyclohex-1-enyl ring. The absolute configuration of 1 was assigned by comparing rotation with known analogue. An analogue, (S)-8-hydroxy-p-menth-l-en-7-yl benzoate, which has the rotation of -45.2 (c 0.85, CHCl3), was determined to S configuration (Beerli and Borschberg [1991]). For compound 1 contained only one chiral center, and also with a negative value for its rotation, -65.4 (c 0.036, CHCl3), the configuration of C-4 was identified as S. Consequently, the structure of Illigerate F(1) was as shown in Figure 1.Illigerate G (2) was isolated as light yellow oil. The molecular formula C19H26O3 was deduced from positive ESIMS (m/z 325.1772 [M þ Na]+, calcd for C19H26O3Na, 325.1780), indicating seven degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum displayed absorptions of C ¼ O (1703 cm-1) group. The 13C NMR (DEPT) spectrum exhibited 19 carbon signals attributed to four quaternary carbons (including one carbonyl, two olefinic carbons and one oxygenated quaternary carbon), seven methines (six olefinic carbons and one oxymethine), six methylenes (one oxygenated), and two methyls. The 1H and 13C NMR data of compound 2 were similar to those of 1, except that two methylenes (dC 30.9, dH 2.57 (2H, t, J ¼ 8.0 Hz); dC 35.8, dH 2.88 (2H, t, J ¼ 8.0 Hz)) replaced the trans-double bond at C-7\\' and 8\\' of 1, which is supported by the HMBC correlations of H-7\\'/C-9\\', H-8\\'/C-1\\', H-7\\'/C-2\\' and C-6\\'. The equatorial position of 2-hydroxypropan-2-yl group at C-4 was deduced from the coupling constants of H-4 (11.6, 11.2, 4.9, 2.4 Hz). Since compound 2 also has a negative rotation, -59.9 (c 0.39, CHCl3), the configuration of 2 was assigned to 4S. Consequently, the structure of 2 was defined as that shown in Figure 1.\", \\'ref_58:1. introduction Terpenes are organic compounds based on isoprene core. Depending on the number of isoprene subunits in the structure, they are classified as: hemiterpenes (one isoprene unit, C5), monoterpenes (two isoprene units, C10), sesquiterpenes (three isoprene units, C15), diterpenes (four isoprene units, C20), sesterpenes (five isoprene units, C25), triterpenes (six isoprene units, C30), tetraterpenes (eight isoprene units, C40), and polyterpenes (more than 8 isoprene units, > 40C) [1,2]. They are isolated mainly from plants [3], but some of them are found in fungi [4], bacteria [5] and insects [6]. Monoterpene skeleton may be linear, monocyclic or bicyclic, with various functional groups, such as hydroxyls, carbonyls and carboxyls, attached. Cyclodextrins, along with calixarenes [7], cucurbiturils [8] and pillararenes [9] belong to the class of macrocyclic receptors able to bind various organic molecules both in solution [10] and in the solid state.[11] Native cyclodextrins (a, b, and gCDs) are toroid-like shaped oligosaccharides built from glucose subunits. Due to their dual character: hydrophobic inner cavity and hydrophilic outer space they are applied for solubilization of compounds characterized by poor solubility in water.

Both camphors formed 1:1 complexes of the same association constant (350 M1 ) with bCD. Crystal structures of aCD complexes with camphor enantiomers were described by Bethanis et al.[22] Complexation of camphor with bCD and its derivatives was also studied by Ciobanu et al.[23] In the present Letter solid state complexes of bCD ([Fig. 1a](#page-1-0)) and both camphor enantiomers ([Fig. 1](#page-1-0)b) are presented and characterized by single crystal X-ray crystallography.

These secondary metabolites are biosynthesized in plants from three molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which is a product of the condensation reaction of one molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and two molecules of isopentenyl diphosphate (PPI) catalyzed by farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDS). PPI and DMAPP are synthesized in two independent metabolic processes, the mevalonate (MVA) and the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathways, which are localized in cytosol and chloroplasts, respectively. The first step in the biosynthesis of SLs is FPP cyclization catalyzed by sesquiterpene synthases (STPSs), resulting in the formation of γ-lactone, a precursor of lactones found in the Asteraceae family. STPSs are mainly localized in the cytosol and are characterized by plasticity, demonstrating the ability to reuse the substrate. The cyclization reaction is followed by a series of oxidations and hydroxylations carried out by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Then, the structure of C15 can be modified by other enzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenases, reductases, and acyl transferases. The diversity of STPSs and cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and their broad enzymatic activity results in a great diversity of SL structures. The biogenetic scheme for SLs was proposed first by Herz in 1977, and a few years later, Seaman arranged the different types of carbon skeletons into four columns that determined the successive stages of biogenesis. SLs present in arnica flowers belong to the group of pseudoguayanolides. The chemical structure of the most of the natural SLs is complex, so their laboratory production generally involves multistep synthesis. For the flagship H compound, a few different strategies of organic synthesis were proposed with a small overall product yield, especially if the stereochemistry of a naturally occurring compound is of interest (for example H 6.6%). Therefore, the research effort to increase SLs biosynthesis in plants is even more important.Numerous SLs found in the plant, not just in Asteraceae, accumulate in specialized tissues, such as glandular trichomes, oil bodies, and resin channels, as well as in organs, e.g., in flowers, leaves, others in roots or fruits, and even in the whole plant. The exact place of synthesis in cells, tissues, or plant organs has not yet been determined. Most likely, it is characteristic of the species. Recognition of the place of lactone biosynthesis is of fundamental importance for determining the physiological function of these compounds and their role in the life of the plant, but it may also facilitate the isolation of enzymes related to the biosynthesis of these compounds. Information regarding the presence of genes involved in the biosynthesis and accumulation of these compounds is valuable. This knowledge may prove also important in metabolic engineering efforts to increase the biosynthesis of SLs because pathway redundancy and involvement of multiple intracellular compartments make genetic transformation difficult. Manipulation of a single enzymatic step often brings unpredictable effects and sometimes leads to defective plants, such as in tomato transgenic plants with overexpression of phytoene synthase. A positive example of genetic modification and elimination of unwanted components in peppermint was the introduction of the antisense version of (+)-menthofuran synthase (+) and the introduction of elite transgenic lines. Otherwise, the production of artemisinin in tobacco plants was achieved by introducing two mega-biosynthetic pathways separately into the chloroplast and nuclear genome.SLs present in the studied taxa, Arnica montana L., A. montana cv. Arbo, and Arnica chamissonis Less., are mainly H esters (helenanolides) and DH esters (dihydrohelenanolides) with carboxylic acids. The anti-inflammatory activity of these compounds has been demonstrated in cellular immune responses to infections, stress, free radicals, UV radiation, and other factors. Lyss et al. proved that H and DH inhibit the activity of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NF-κB) of activated B cells, T cells, and epithelial cells in response to four different stimuli, eliminating gene expression controlled by NF-κB. Hall et al. proved that the activity of these compounds is conditioned by the presence of an α-methylene-γ-lactone group and a hydroxyl group at C-6 carbon (Figure 1). Esterification or elimination of the C-6 hydroxyl group significantly reduces the anti-inflammatory activity of H. In addition, the presence of a ring of β-unsaturated cyclopentenone and α-epoxy-methylenecyclopentenone also determines the anti-inflammatory effect of the compound; however, Jacobs et al. showed that helenalin acetate (HA) is a stronger inhibitor of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPβ) than NF-κB. HA is the first highly active low-molecular inhibitor of transcription factor C/EBPβ that inhibits C/EBPβ through a direct binding mechanism. Both H and HA contain two α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups (Figure 1). These electrophilic moieties are known to undergo Michael addition reactions with nucleophiles, such as thiol cysteine residues. Both compounds inhibit the activity of DNA binding to the transcription factor NF-κB by covalently modifying the Cys38 at the p65 subunit of NF-κB. Jakobs et al. have shown that the activity of the lactones may depend on both reactive groups. To prove this, they investigated the inhibitory potential of two similar SLs, chamissonolid and 11α, 13-dihydrohelenalin acetate, both having only one of the reactive groups of HA in their structure. It turned out that these compounds were practically inactive compared to HA. The above studies confirmed that the specific spatial structure of these molecules, and not just the mere presence of two reactive groups, determine inhibitory activity. On the other hand, studies have revealed that C/EBPβ is the regulatory link between granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling pathways and that C/EBPβ-deficient macrophages exhibit serious impaired proliferation of these cells, in which this complex stimulates fatty acid absorption and fat cell differentiation, and defective lipid metabolism is the primary cause of lung disease (PAP) and atherosclerosis.\\', \\'ref_60:The topic is Screening filamentous fungi for biocatalytic transformation of lupeol to produce bioactive derivatives. The following filamentous fungi were found capable of biotransforming lupeol: Aspergillus ochraceus and Mucor rouxii. The abilities of these fungi were demonstrated only when the fungi cultures were developed in the Koch’s K1 medium. In addition, the biotransformation products were only detected after a specific incubation time, indicating the influence of the incubation time on the biotransformation reactions. Medium composition usually plays an important role in biotransformation processes, since different nutrients may affect the functional and structural development of the fungi. In addition, the type and concentration of cosolvents used to dissolve a water insoluble substrate in the culture medium may affect the microorganism growth, as well as the bioconversion yield. Substrate addition should be always performed in such a way that exactly the same amount of substrate, dissolved in the cosolvent, should be added to the cultures, at a concentration previously determined, in order to avoid toxicity problems. The time course of the biotransformation process is another key issue and is dependent on the growth characteristics of the microorganisms, the culture conditions, the substrate concentration and the type of reaction. The seed medium was used in order to increase the biomass of the cultures and only after the end of the growth phase, the biomass of each culture was transferred to Czapek and Koch’s K1 media, which were used in the biotransformation step. The choice of this strategy is due to the fact that the enzymes produced during the stationary phase are less specific than those produced during the growth phase. The glycosyltransferases produced in the secondary metabolism, for example, are capable of catalysing reactions with a larger number of substrates when compared with those produced in the primary metabolism. The obtained results suggest that the protocol presented here is useful, but should be performed in different biotransformation media.The biotransformation of lupeol by A. ochraceus and M. rouxii afforded two compounds in each culture, which were detected in the cultures developed for more than seven days. These compounds were the only derivatives detected under GC-MS operating conditions. The GC retention times (RT) of the produced derivatives varied according to the fungus, as well as the relative intensities of some ions, including the molecular ion. The GC retention time of lupeol was 35.4 min. The mass spectra of lupeol and its biotransformation products were initially obtained at 70 eV, which is the electron beam energy used for most spectrum libraries. However, at this energy, the mass spectra of all the biotransformation products were identical, in despite of their different retention times. Peaks of the molecular ions of such compounds could be observed only when the beam energy was set at 35 eV. The mass spectra obtained displayed a series of ions similar to those observed for lupeol, such as the fragment ions with m/z 189 and m/z 207, which is considered characteristic for the fragmentation of triterpenes with a lupane skeleton bearing a hydroxyl group in position 3. The electron ionization mass spectra of lupeol (RT = 35.468) and of the derivatives 2 and 3 produced by A. ochraceus (retention times of 46.5 and 48.8 min) and those produced by M. rouxii (4 and 5, retention times of 46.0 and 48.0 min) are shown in Figure 2. The identification of the biotransformation products mostly have been made on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data. However, due to the complexity of the reaction media obtained from the fungi used in this study and the small amounts of the obtained extracts (range from 5 to 10 mg), the isolation of the lupeol derivatives and their characterization by NMR was not possible. Hyphenated techniques, such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have played a key role in the analysis of low amount of complex samples that require separation previously to the identification. GC-MS takes the advantage of the possibility of fast identification based on the comparison with library spectra obtained at 70 eV, reason for why this technique was used herein. Furthermore, the fragmentation pathways of lupeol and other pentacyclic triterpenes using electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) have been extensively reported in the literature. According to those studies, the fragmentation of lupeol is initiated by C-14–C-27 cleavage and consequent •CH3 elimination, as shown in Figure 3. The fragment ions m/z 411 and m/z 383 can eventually not be observed, once they can easily decompose in other fragment ions with lower m/z. Otherwise, the fragment ions m/z 207 and m/z 189 have been proposed to be formed as a result of two competitive pathways, which can be used to diagnose the presence of substituents in A, B, C, D or E rings.MS spectra of the biotransformation products of lupeol produced by A. ochraceus and M. rouxii were initially obtained at 70 eV, and hence compared with the MS spectrum of lupeol, as previously discussed in this paper. At this energy, all the MS spectra were very similar in the m/z range from 55 to 207. However, the MS spectra of the biotransformation products differ from the corresponding spectrum of lupeol due to the presence of an ion with m/z 384 in place of m/z 426. In principle, this could indicate that these biotransformation products are isomers with molecular weight 384, but exhibiting very different retention times in GC. Otherwise, this could also indicate that the molecular ions of such compounds decomposes into fragment ions with lower m/z during the flight from the ion source to the analyzer due to the high residual energy content that is transferred to the molecular ion. Thus, in order to confirm the molecular weight of these compounds, MS spectrum of lupeol and its biotransformation products were obtained using lower electron beam energy. The maximum energy that allowed observing the molecular ions of such compounds was found to be 35 eV. At this energy, the fragmentation pattern of lupeol was observed to be very similar to that of 70 eV, although minor fragment ions, such as M•+–•CH3 and M•+–•CH3-C2H4 have not been observed. These spectra revealed that the biotransformation products of lupeol exhibit different molecular ions and structures, as discussed below. Compounds 2 and 3 were produced by A. ochraceus and exhibited retention times of 46.5 and 48.8 min, respectively. Analysis of the MS spectrum of compound 2 (Figure 2) revealed that its molecular ion (m/z 384) is 42 mass units lower than lupeol. This mass difference can be due to the elimination of the isopropenyl group at C-19 as propene and subsequent formation of a double bond between C-18 and C-19 (Figure 4). This structural modification can be supported by the intensity of the fragment ion m/z 147 in the MS spectrum of compound 2, which is higher than in the MS spectrum of compounds 3, 4, 5 and lupeol (see Figure 2). Eliminations of alkyl groups and other size chain have been previously reported to be promoted by this fungus. Otherwise, the molecular ion of compound 3 (m/z 424) is two mass units lower than that of lupeol (m/z 426), which can be associated with the formation of a double bond. Taking into account that the fragment ions with m/z 207 and m/z 189 did not show mass decrease in comparison with those of lupeol, it is proposed that the double bond is formed between C-11 and C-12 of ring C, as shown in Figure 3. The presence of a double bond in A, B, D or E rings would result in the formation of fragment ions with m/z 205 and m/z 187, which are not observed in the spectrum of compound 3. Desaturation by double bond formation has been reported to be promoted by other fungi, but this has not been reported for A. ochraceus. Compounds 4 and 5 were produced by M. rouxii and exhibited retention times of 46.0 and 48.0 min, respectively. The MS spectrum of compound 4 is very similar to that of lupeol, however, its molecular ion (m/z 442) is 16 Da higher than lupeol. This indicates that compound 4 contains an oxygen atom more than lupeol. The presence of the fragment ions m/z 207 and m/z 189 lead us to suggest that this atom is likely bound at C-11 or C-12 of the ring C moiety, as shown in Figure 3. Finally, the molecular ion of compound 5 (m/z 526) is 100 mass units higher than the corresponding ion of lupeol (m/z 426). This mass difference is proposed to be due to two addition oxygen atoms and to a prenyl group. Hydroxylation by Mucor rouxii has been previously reported and genes involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis were isolated from Mucor circinelloides. The fragmentation pattern of compound 5 is similar to that of lupeol, despite differences between their structures. This similarity, together with the ions m/z 207 and m/z 189, can indicate that both the oxygen and the isopentenyl groups are also in the C ring, as shown in Figure 4. The time courses of these biotransformations were followed by GC-MS and the relative ratio between the substrate and its transformed products was determined on the basis of the peak area of GC. Biotransformation experiments were carried out for 240 h and each flask was taken every 24 h, extracted with ethyl acetate, and analyzed by GC-MS. The results are reported in Figure 5 and Figure 6. Lupeol was 38.0% and 46.0% consumed by A. ochraceus and M. rouxii, respectively, in 10 days. The relative ratios of compounds 2 and 3 with respect to lupeol were 17.3% and 11.1%, respectively, after 7 days incubation, increasing to 19.0% of compound 2 and remaining unchanged until the 10th day. The major product in the biotransformation of lupeol by M. rouxii was compound 4 and its relative ratio with respect to lupeol was 26.5% after 10 days incubation. The relative ratio of compound 5 with respect to lupeol was 16.0% on the 7th day remaining unchanged until the 10th day.\\', \\'ref_61:The four alkynyl sterols shown in Fig. 2 were available for use in our studies. Alkynyl-cholesterol (a-Chol) and alkynyl-7-dehydrocholesterol (a-7-DHC) had been previously reported, the starting material for the synthesis of both being 3β-hydroxy-5-cholenic acid. The starting material for preparation of alkynyl-lanosterol (a-Lan) was lanosterol itself, while alkynyl-lathosterol (a-Lath) was prepared starting from ergosterol. In both of these syntheses, the double bond in the tail of the starting material was oxidatively cleaved and the aldehyde so generated was subjected to coupling with an appropriate Grignard reagent, which was then reduced with lithium aluminum hydride, see Fig. 2B and C. Details of the syntheses of a-Lan (four steps) and a-Lath (eight steps) are provided in Supporting Information (Appendix A, Appendix A). Cells were grown in the presence or absence of alkynyl sterols for 24–48 h and lipids isolated as described in Materials and Methods. Alkynyl sterols and endogenous sterols were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC-MS, the alkynyl analogs eluting earlier than the natural compounds. Like their natural counterparts, a-Lath and a-Chol did not separate under any of the HPLC chromatography conditions attempted. These two sterols could be separated by GC however, and a combination of the HPLC-MS and GC was required for a complete analysis of a-sterol and natural sterol product mixtures. The HPLC retention times for the a-sterols under the conditions described in Materials and Methods were a-7-DHC, 3.8 min; (a-Lath and a-Chol), 4.1 min; and a-Lan, 4.8 min. For comparison, natural cholesterol elutes at 9.1 min under the same chromatography conditions.In Neuro2a cells, both a-Lath and a-Lan undergo bio-conversion to a-Chol as the major product when incubated with the cells for 24 h at concentrations <10 μM. Our initial experiments were carried out with a-Lath at concentrations of 5 μM and 10 μM in Neuro2a cells, the a-sterol profiles found were as follows: For 5 μM a-Lath incubation for 24 h, mole fractions of a-Lath remaining=0.16; a-7-DHC=0.10; and a-Chol=0.74. For 10 μM a-Lath incubation for 24 h, mole fractions of a-Lath remaining=0.32; a-7-DHC=0.21; and a-Chol=0.47. The natural sterol levels found after 24 h incubations with a-Lath were somewhat suppressed compared to levels found in controls, the total sterol levels (a-sterols+natural sterols) totaled 70–80% of the natural sterols found in control cells. Higher concentrations of a-Lath had a larger effect on reducing the total sterol levels. The alkynyl sterols made up 25% and 40% of the total sterol levels at a-Lath concentrations of 5 and 10 µM, respectively. After the exploratory experiments with a-Lath in Neuro2a cells, subsequent studies were carried out with a-Lan at 0.1, 1.0, 5.0 and 10 μM in both Neuro2a and Dhcr7-deficient Neuro2a cells. Fig. 3 presents a typical HPLC-MS chromatogram for a product mixture derived from an experiment of 10 μM of a-Lan incubated in Neuro2a for 24 h. Under these conditions a-Chol is the major alkynyl sterol found in the product mixture, panel E in Fig. 3. The starting material in the experiment, a-Lan (panel A, Fig. 3), is always detected in the mix of alkynyl sterols found as is a-7-DHC, (panel D in Fig. 3). Only trace amounts of other alkynyl sterols, including a-Lath, were found in product mixtures but the two alkynyl compounds shown in panels B and C in Fig. 3 were always detected. The structures assigned to these products are tentative, they have not been independently synthesized, but the diene shown in panel C is the biosynthetic product of CYP51A1 demethylation of a-Lan and this diene is the immediate biosynthetic precursor to the alkene shown in panel B of the Fig. 3. The major alkynyl sterols found in control or Dhcr7-deficient Neuro2a cells after 24 h incubation with a-Lan are a-Lan, a-7-DHC and a-Chol. Fig. 4 shows the alkynyl sterol mole fractions determined from incubations at 5 and 10 μM a-Lan in both cell types. Incubations at 0.1 and 1 μM give similar qualitative results to the incubations carried out at higher concentrations but with more complete consumption of a-Lan at the lower concentrations, the mole fraction at 24 h of a-Chol in control Neuro2a cells approaching 1.0. In a similar way, incubation with 0.1 μM a-Lan in Dhcr7-deficient Neuro2a cells for 24 h gave an alkynyl sterol distribution with a-7-DHC close to 1.0. Total sterol levels (alkynyl + endogenous) in the experiments with a-Lan dropped to about 90% of the endogenous levels in control cells.To determine the utility of alkyne sterol surrogates in a variety of cell culture models, we cultured human fibroblasts with a-Lan. a-Chol biosynthesis from a-Lan was compared in control fibroblasts and fibroblasts from two different cholesterol disorders, SLOS and Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). NPC is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids. Table 1 shows the alkynyl and natural sterol distribution in human fibroblasts incubated with a-Lan for 6 days. The results from experiments with control fibroblasts are similar to those described for the a-Lan in Neuro2a cells. For control fibroblasts as with control Neuro2a cells most of the alkynyl sterol was found as a-Chol (85%) with only fractional a-Lan (8%) and a-7-DHC (7%) found after 6 days of incubation. In contrast, in SLOS fibroblasts, most of the alkynyl sterol (83%) was found in the a-7-DHC fraction after 6 days. We conclude that the results of studies in human fibroblasts parallel those found in control and Dhcr7-deficient Neuro2a cells. a-Lan is converted into a-7-DHC in SLOS fibroblasts while in control and NPC cells, a-Chol is the major product formed. Total cholesterol accumulation in NPC is significantly increased compared to control fibroblasts, a result that accurately reflects the defect described for this disorder.The alkyne functional group serves as a tag that can be used to concentrate covalent sterol-protein adducts formed from the alkynyl sterol precursor. This strategy, which is presented in Fig. 5A, involves incubation of Dhcr7-deficient Neuro2a cells with a-Lan or a-7-DHC for 24 h followed by treatment of the cell lysate with a biotin azide under Huisgen-Sharpless click conditions. The click reaction links any sterol alkyne-protein covalent adducts formed with biotin, which can then be visualized by the use of streptavidin immunoblotting. In the experiments described in Fig. 5A, a photo-cleavable biotin azide (see Supporting information, Fig. S1 for the structure) was used in the click-reaction step and the protein mixture treated with streptavidin beads. This was followed by a pre-wash of the beads to remove un-adducted proteins and the covalent a-sterol protein adducts were then subsequently released by photolysis of the streptavidin beads with a small hand-held UV lamp. As shown in Fig. 5B, a total of 833 proteins were identified as being significantly enriched in the photorelease fractions for the treatment of Dhcr7-deficient Neuro2a cells with 5 μM a-7-DHC or 10 μM a-Lan, 423 of those adducted proteins were found in the incubations of both alkynyl sterols. The alkyne sterol tag used in these studies permitted the identification of adducted proteins and allowed for a preliminary ranking and classification of those proteins. The enrichment factor (log2 [protein spectral counts for treated cells/protein spectral counts for control cells]) was used to compare the enrichment of the 423 common proteins adducted in the a-7-DHC and a-Lan experiments. Inspection of the enrichment factor data shown in Fig. 5C suggested that the adducts identified from a-7-DHC were more highly enriched than the same adducts found in the a-Lan study, even though the concentration of a-Lan used was 10 μM, twice that used with a-7-DHC. Enrichment data of selected proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, (LSS, LBR, NSDHL and CYP51), for example, showed them to be more highly adducted in the a-7-DHC experiment than was found in experiments with a-Lan, see Fig. 1 for the protein function and Fig. 5C for relative enrichment. The enrichment factors for the 423 proteins found common to the a-7-DHC and a-Lan experiments and the ranking of each protein based on enrichment are presented in Table S1 in Supporting information. A comparison of a-7-DHC and a-Lan protein ranks in various protein classes is presented in the Discussion Section.\\', \\'ref_62:Bearing in mind the mechanism proposed for the reactions mediated by these two reagents, we surmised that these species could well intervene efficiently in the homocoupling of allylic halides (Scheme 1). In a previous paper19a we described the first results of a new catalytic method for the homocoupling of allylic bromides mediated by TiIII, including the enantioselective preparation of onocerane derivatives **1** and **2**. We describe here the complete development of the process, the ability of ZrIV to catalyze these homocouplings in the presence of manganese metal (to our knowledge no precedence of ZrIV catalyzing these kind of processes can be found in the literature), and finally, new applications toward the synthesis of symmetric terpenes, such as the preparation of advanced key-intermediates in the syntheses of (+)-cymbodiacetal (**3**)20 and dimeric *ent*-kauranoids (**4**), such as xindongnin M (**4a**),21 and an improved synthetic way to prepare squalene (**5**) (Figure 1).**Acknowledgment.** This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology, Projects BQU 2002-03211 and CTQ2006-15575-C02-01.

However, most diterpenoid compounds cannot be produced commercially due to their low concentrations in the native host. An efficient diterpenoid-producing yeast cell factory would be of broad interest as it could be used to produce a variety of high-value diterpenoid compounds in a cost-effective manner. In yeast, terpenoid synthesis begins with the common precursors IPP and DMAPP, which are derived from the MVA pathway in the cytoplasm. The diterpenoid precursor GGPP is systematically synthesized by Erg20p and Bts1p in S. cerevisiae. Erg9p plays a vital role in the distribution of FPP flux between FPP-derived terpenoid products and sterols. In our previous study, the ERG9 promoter was replaced with MET3p in S. cerevisiae to produce levopimaradiene, a type of diterpene produced by plants at a titer 8.5-fold higher than that produced by its parental strain. However, this strategy needs the addition of methionine, which could be metabolized by the cell. In this study, a well-established sesquiterpene-producing yeast platform, LW03, was used to produce 13R-MO by overexpressing CfTPS2 and CfTPS3, but the titer of 13R-MO did not increase significantly.In our previous study, LW03 was found to accumulate squalene (3.73 mg/g CDW) during fermentation anaphase, although ERG9 was controlled by HXT1p, an efficient promoter for repressing ERG9 transcription under glucose-limiting conditions. To block squalene synthesis, a PEST (rich in Pro, Glu/Asp, Ser, and Thr) sequence was added to the C-terminal of Erg9p (LZJ2) to trigger endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. This strategy improved the titer of the sesquiterpene nerolidol by 86% and decreased the level of squalene to that of the wild-type control strain. Indeed, the squalene content of the LZJ2 strain was decreased to 0.12 mg/g CDW, but the 13R-MO titer remained low and the FOH and GGOH titers increased by 3.53-fold and 1.87-fold, respectively. The level of FOH and GGOH accumulation often reflects the intracellular content of the FPP and GGPP pools. The increases observed in the FPP and GGPP pools indicate that combining the regulation of transcription and protein destabilization effectively reduces FPP consumption by Erg9p and redirects the carbon flux from squalene to FPP and GGPP.In S. cerevisiae, the diterpenoid precursor GGPP is synthesized by the condensation of FPP and IPP by Bts1p. The coupling of FPP and GGPP synthesis was found to be an important limitation of diterpene production. Selection of GGPP synthases from different sources and overexpression of native BTS1 were all attempted to improve the supply of GGPP. An Erg20p mutant (Erg20F96Cp) was constructed to produce GGPP, and was found to efficiently produce diterpenes and carotenoids. To draw the FPP pool to GGPP, BTS1 and ERG20F96C were co-expressed in LZJ3 causing an increase in FOH, GGOH, and 13R-MO production compared with the parental strain LZJ2. Although Erg20F96Cp produced GGPP, no obvious effect on FPP formation was observed in vitro. To further combine FPP and GGPP synthesis, Bts1p was fused with Erg20p or Erg20F96Cp; the two fusion proteins were able to effectively draw FPP to GGPP, resulting in a decrease in FOH accumulation of approximately 50% compared with the parental strain LZJ3. The Bts1-GGGS-Erg20F96Cp fusion protein was found to be more effective for GGPP production and led to about threefold GGOH production when compared with Bts1p and Erg20F96Cp co-expression. The 13R-MO titer was also increased to 23.21 mg/L. Erg20p and Bts1p fusion is an efficient method of improving diterpene production, and in our study the fusion of mutant Erg20p (Erg20F96Cp) and Bts1p enabled FPP and GGPP to be coupled more efficiently.In plants, GGPP is synthesized in plastids through the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway. A plastid transit peptide located at the N-terminal of diterpene synthase was found to influence its catalytic activity when the enzyme was expressed in S. cerevisiae. In this study, the N-terminal plastid transit peptides of CfTPS2 and CfTPS3 were truncated according to the predictions of the ChloroP software, and the resulting enzymes were integrated into the δ sites of LZJ6. 13R-MO production increased by 7.6-fold (176.8 mg/L) compared with the level produced by the parental strain LZJ5. The accumulation of GGOH and FOH decreased significantly, which indicated that the precursor pool was successfully converted to 13R-MO. The two limiting-nodes, tHMG1 and BTS1-GGGS-ERG20F96C, were further over-expressed in LZJ7, resulting in a higher level of 13R-MO production (328.15 mg/L).\\', \\'ref_64:The chemical structure of PLA changed upon irradiation in the UV-C range, which was confirmed by comparing the FTIR spectra of the irradiated samples with the spectrum of the unirradiated fibrous PLA material (Figure 5). It is noticeable that irradiation increased the absorption bands of stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups. The terminal hydroxyl groups in nonirradiated PLA fibers showed a relatively small absorption peak at 3505 cm−1. However, with increasing photodestruction time, an increasing number of ester bonds in the polymer chain were broken and, as a result, the number of terminal hydroxyl and carboxyl groups increased, while absorption in the 3600–3100 cm−1 region increased significantly.Table 2 presents the assignment of the main absorption bands in the FTIR spectra of the fibrous PLA samples according to. The FTIR spectrum of the sample irradiated for 0.5 h revealed not only an increase in the absorption intensity of the hydroxyl groups, but also a broadening of the stretching vibration band of the carbonyl groups at 1774 cm−1, which is also associated with depolymerization and the appearance of new terminal groups in the polymer. At this irradiation time of 0.5 h, fibers without stabilizer additives began to demonstrate pronounced fragility.The sample irradiated for 4 h became a sticky film, without a fibrous structure. Its FTIR spectrum (Figure 5f) was characterized by a significant intensity of a group of absorption bands in the range of 3600–3100 cm−1 and a band at 1047 cm−1, belonging to the stretching and bending vibrations of OH groups, respectively.The FTIR spectra of the materials with added photostabilizers, PLA/DIBP(1) and PLA/NICA(1), demonstrated the same patterns in the growth of absorption bands upon irradiation. The integration of absorption in the region of 3600–3100 cm−1 was carried out and the effect of photodestruction on stabilized and non-stabilized fibers was compared based on the FTIR spectra. In this case, the integrated absorption intensity in the region of 1890–1530 cm−1 was chosen as an internal standard. The ratios of the integral intensities of the FTIR spectrum regions 3600–3100 and 1890–1530 cm−1 for each irradiation time interval (0–2 h) form the dependences presented in Figure 6, quantitatively reflecting the photodestruction processes taking place in the chemical structure of the polymer. After 0.25 h of irradiation, the photoprotective effect of the studied low-molecular additives became visible, namely the samples with additives showed lower values of relative absorption intensity in the region of 3600–3100 cm−1, despite the fact that the nonirradiated fibers with additives had higher absorption values. In Figure 6, a surge in this value for the non-stabilized sample subject to 1 h of irradiation is clearly visible, leading to a sharp increase in the fragility of the fibers. However, the difference in this value for between 1 and 2 h of irradiation was not significant. For example, in, a similar sharp increase in the absorption band at 3400 cm−1 was observed after 1 day of irradiation of TiO2-loaded electrospun fibers of polylactide under UVA light.It is also noticeable that the additives, DIBP and NICA, slow down the formation of new hydroxyl groups during the destructive processes in the polymer. In the samples irradiated for 1 h, the difference in the content of hydroxyl groups between the stabilized and non-stabilized samples reached a maximum.Figure 7 shows the 1H spectrum of the non-irradiated PLA/DIBP(1) sample (Figure 7a). The 1H and 13C JMOD NMR spectra of the samples irradiated for 1 h are presented in Figure 7b,c. The spectrum of the irradiated PLA (Figure 7b) shows increased signals of terminal methyl groups at the chemical shifts of 1.0–1.49 ppm and 2.0–2.5 ppm. The peaks in the region of 4.0–4.5 ppm are presumably associated with the CH of the terminal lactoyl groups. Signals indicating the appearance of new terminal aldehyde groups are found at 9.8 ppm in the 1H spectrum.GPC chromatograms were obtained using a refractometric detector. The resulting molecular mass distribution curves (MMD) are presented in Figure 8. Table 3 shows the results of the number-average (Mn) and mass-average (Mw) molecular weight, as well as the degree of polydispersity (D), for the studied samples.A significant decrease in the molecular weight upon irradiation was noted both for the electrospun material not stabilized by additives and for the samples PLA/DIBP(1) and PLA/NICA(1). This decrease in the molecular weight of the polymer after irradiation with UV-C is associated with a decrease in the number of ester bonds between the PLA monomer units. For comparison, according to data in the literature, an intensity of 2.54 mW/cm2 of UV-C at 245 nm led to a decrease in the molecular weight of PLA by more than four times after 24 h of irradiation.Thermal analysis of the irradiated polylactide samples without additives, and with DIBP and NICA additives, was carried out in an air atmosphere heated to 450 °C. The DSC curves (Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11) for the irradiated and initial samples in the range of 25–170 °C demonstrate a number of phase transitions: a glass transition (Tg) of about 60 °C, cold crystallization (Tcc) at about 65–80 °C, and melting (Tmelt) at 110–140 °C. The appearance of a cold crystallization peak means that during the formation of fibers by electrospinning and upon cooling after stabilization at 60 °C, the conditions for crystallization were not achieved, i.e., the polymer structure was in a nonequilibrium state. In, the cold crystallization effect was interpreted as the result of incomplete/absent crystallization, with a lack of nucleation during cooling of the PLA.Table 4 presents the values of the thermal effects on the TG–DSC curves for the material without the addition of stabilizers. The most sensitive indicator to the effect of irradiation was the Tg value, which smoothly decreased from 60 °C to 43.3 °C over 1 h of irradiation, along with the fact that the corresponding values of ΔCp* practically did not change until 30 min of irradiation. A sharp drop in ΔCp* was detected after 1 h of irradiation for both the sample without additives (Table 4) and with additives (Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11). In samples irradiated for 2 h or more, signs of the glass transition in the thermograms are no longer present in the sample without additives and with the addition of NICA. However, for the PLA/DIBP(1) sample, it is possible that the glass transition effect remained after two hours of irradiation.In Figure 12, it can be seen that both the Tg and other thermal effects in the irradiated samples also change smoothly as a result of irradiation. For example, all values at the beginning of phase transitions shift to the region of low temperatures, and the change in heat capacity, enthalpy of the cold crystallization effect, and melting decrease from less irradiated to more irradiated samples.The UV protective effect, caused by the introduction of DIBP and NICA additives, is noticeable due to the higher Tg temperatures of the samples irradiated for 1 h (Figure 12). Just like with the FTIR analysis, the maximum difference between the Tg is observed after 1 h of irradiation.For example, in, when irradiating PLA films that were 10 µm thick, which is 20 times thicker than the fibers studied here, a significant difference in the Tg of nano-silver stabilized polylactide began to be observed after 20 h of UV-C irradiation.When the stabilized fibers were irradiated, signs of the glass transition phase transition were reliably identified even after 2 h of irradiation, except in the case of the sample with the lowest concentration of NICA, namely 0.06%, when no Tg effect was detected in a sample irradiated for 2 h.The decrease in the Tg during irradiation indicates that the polymer structure becomes less integrated, and the internal volume of the polymer increases, which is facilitated by an increase in the proportion of low molecular weight compounds formed. In this regard, it should be noted that the introduction of DIBP or NICA in various quantities has virtually no effect on the Tg, Tcc, and Tmelt of the nonirradiated samples. It should be noted that the melting peak of 136.3 °C was observed not only for the initial PLA, but also at up to 2 h of irradiation, although gradually decreasing in regard to the enthalpy value. A sharp decrease in the enthalpy of melting and the disappearance of the melting peak was observed after 2 h of irradiation (Figure 13), which means greater changes in the PLA structure than that revealed in with the same UV-C wavelength, but where the PLA was tested in the form of films. In those works, this peak disappeared after more than 4 h of UV-C exposure. In, there was a sharp decline in the value of the energy of melting after only 15 min of irradiation. Using ZnO as a photoprotector, the greatest difference compared to unprotected PLA fibers was detected after 4 h of irradiation. During photodecomposition of PLA with polybutylene adipate terephthalate as a photoprotector at 254 nm in, the Tg shifted to higher values, while the melting temperature decreased by several degrees.The PLA/DIBP(1) and PLA/NICA(1) samples showed the best results in regard to protecting the PLA from UV-C after 1 and 2 h of irradiation, based on the Tg values. For example, in, a noticeable photoprotective effect after 2 h of irradiation appeared when 3% or 5% of modified montmorillonite are introduced into polylactide.In, synergistic effects of photostabilization between UV absorbance and the antioxidant properties of polyphenols of plant extracts were noticed. However, DIBP and NICA were not very effective when used together, despite the shielding function of NICA and the antioxidant properties of DIBP. The analysis of the irradiated PLA/(DIBP + NICA)(0.1) sample revealed a significant decrease in the Tg at 1 and 2 h of irradiation (Figure 12a). The PLA/(DIBP + NICA)(1) sample showed a Tg at 5 °C less at 1 h of irradiation, which is noticeably worse in comparison with the PLA/DIBP(1) and PLA/NICA(1) samples; although, the total molar concentration of additives was equal in these samples.The polymer structure of nonirradiated electrospun PLA material undergoes thermal–oxidative destruction at 319.5 ± 0.6 °C, as determined by the beginning of a decrease in the mass on the TG curve. The duration of irradiation led to a decrease in the temperature at the onset of PLA decomposition, from 319.5 °C to 260.3 °C after 8 h of irradiation (Figure 14). The addition of 1 and 0.1 wt.% of DIBP decreased the onset temperature of PLA decomposition by 15.8 °C and 10.4 °C, respectively. The addition of NICA, on the contrary, promoted thermal stability of the polymer and increased the onset temperature of PLA decomposition by 6.3 °C in the PLA/NICA(1) sample and by 2.5 °C in the PLA/NICA(0.1) sample (Figure 14). However, both NICA and DIBP showed a more or less pronounced thermoprotective effect on the irradiated samples, which can be explained by the better preservation of the polymer structure of the fibers modified with additives after irradiation compared to fibers without additives.In, 0.8% of UV absorption groups of benzophenones in the PLA structure had a similar effect on the temperature of thermal decomposition in the samples irradiated for 2 h, namely a decrease in temperature by 7.2 °C, which is comparable to our results.The Py–GC/MS chromatograms (Figure 15) of the nonirradiated samples have a set of peaks in regard to substances typical of the pyrolysis decomposition of PLA. The most intense peaks in the chromatograms are the peaks of carbon dioxide, acetaldehyde, and lactides (see Table 5).When comparing the chromatograms of pyrolysis products of nonirradiated and irradiated PLA materials, it is noticeable that the most obvious changes appear in the RT range from 7.4 min to 8 min with increasing irradiation time, namely the intensity and number of peaks in this range increases. Analysis of the chromatograms showed that the relative total content of methyltartronic and 2-methyl-2-butenoic acids in pyrolysis products increased approximately 20 times after 1 h of UV-C irradiation (Figure 15, 1 h) and another 1.5 times over the next 7 h of irradiation (Figure 15, 8 h).In the RT region, from 12 min to 16.5 min, in the chromatograms (Figure 15) of irradiated PLA materials, there is an increase in the number and intensity of the peaks corresponding to two and three basic acids and their esters (C5–C8), with molecular weights from 146 to 246. Therefore, these groups of peaks were used to control the effectiveness of the photoprotective effect of NICA and DIBP. More detailed changes in the amounts of these pyrolysis products during irradiation, as well as the effect of the addition of photostabilizers, NICA and DIBP, were analyzed by plotting the dependence of the yield of pyrolysis products with the RT from 7.4 min to 8 min, and with the RT from 12 min to 16.5 min (Figure 16) on the irradiation time.The amount of acidic pyrolysis products with an RT from 7.4 min to 8 min (Figure 16) increases very quickly up to 1 h of irradiation; after 4 h of irradiation, the curve reaches a plateau with a slight increase. Acidic products may indicate autohydrolysis, explaining the abrupt transformation from a brittle to a sticky material. The polymer materials with NICA and DIBP additives showed a decrease in the yield of methyltartronic and 2-methyl-2-butenoic acids in pyrolysis products in the irradiation time range from 1 to 4 h, which indicates the preservation of the protective effect of these stabilizers at 4 h of irradiation. With 1 h irradiation, the greatest difference in the yield of these acids relative to pure PLA was shown by: PLA/DIBP(1), PLA/NICA(1), and PLA/DIBP(0.1). By 8 h, no significant difference was observed in the stabilized samples and the comparison sample.The appearance of products in the RT region from 12 min to 16.5 min (Figure 16) also depended on the photoprotector introduced into the polymer. Among the samples irradiated for 1 and 2 h, the samples PLA/DIBP(1) and PLA/(DIBP + NICA)(1) were different for the better: the yield of these thermal destruction products was the lowest.\\', \\'ref_65:Appropriate amounts of compounds 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b were separately weighed, and each compound was divided into two equal portions, placed in amber sample vials, and dissolved in methanol to obtain sample solutions with concentrations of 1.0 mg/mL. The solutions were sealed and separately stored at 30 °C and 45 °C. Each sample solution was analysed by HPLC every hour until tautomerization occurred. Then, the analysis was performed every 24 h until equilibrium was achieved. Chromatographic analysis was performed on a Waters 2996/Waters 2487 (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a YMC C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm) with acetonitrile-water (23–70) implemented as the mobile phase for isocratic elution. The flow rate was 1.0 mL·min−1, and the column temperature was 25 °C. The detection wavelength was 230 nm. The stability of 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b and the time taken to reach equilibrium under different temperatures were observed. Furthermore, the tautomerization mechanism of the two pairs of tautomeric diterpenoids was investigated, and transition state calculations for the reactions were conducted using density functional theory. Gaussview 5.0 was used to build the molecular structures of the tautomers. The transition state was found at the B3LYP/6–31 + g (d) level and was confirmed by vibration frequency analysis. Then, the minimum energy path (MEP) was determined by using intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations, and the imaginary vibrational mode of the transition state was studied. The stability of compounds 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b and their transition states were calculated by means of the density functional theory (DFT) method at the 6–31 + g(d) level. The calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package.In this paper, four undescribed 7,20-non-epoxy-ent-kaurane skeleton tautomeric diterpenes [1a (45\\\\u2009mg) and 1b (30\\\\u2009mg) and 2a (42\\\\u2009mg) and 2b (31\\\\u2009mg)] (Fig. 1) were isolated from the aerial parts of I. excisoides utilizing various chromatographic methods, including D-101 macroporous adsorptive resins, silica gel, sephadex LH-20 and semi-preparative HPLC. The structures of 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry in conjunction with published data of their analogues, as well as their fragmentation patterns. As the result, the four compounds were elucidated to be 1α,7α-dihydroxy-14β,20-diacetoxy-ent-kaur-15-one (1a), 1α,14β-dihydroxy-7α,20-diacetoxy-ent-kaur-15-one (1b), 1α,14β-diacetoxy-7α,20-dihydroxy-ent-kaur-16-en-15-one (2a), and 1α,7α-diacetoxy-14β,20-dihydroxy-ent-kaur-16-en-15-one (2b) (Fig. 1, Tables 1 and 2).Compound 1a was a white powder. The molecular formula of 1a was determined to be C24H34O7 on the basis of positive HRESIMS at m/z 457.21759 [M\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009Na]+ (calcd for C24H34O7Na+, m/z 457.21967). The UV spectrum of 1a showed an absorption maximum at 235\\\\u2009nm. The IR spectrum of 1a showed the presence of hydroxyl (3445\\\\u2009cm−1), carbonyl (1729 cm−1) and double bond (1649 cm−1) groups. The 1H, 13C-NMR and HSQC spectra of 1a, together with the results from an HMBC experiment showed the presence of one exocyclic double bond [δH 6.15 (1H, brs), 5.38 (1H, brs); δC 117.9, 146.3], two angular methyl groups [δH 0.88 (3H, s) and 0.81 (3H, s); δC 33.3 (q) and 21.3 (q)], one ketone carbonyl (δC 207.0) and two acetoxyl groups [δH 2.16 (3H, s); δC 171.3 (s), 21.5 (q); δH 1.99 (3H, s); δC 170.2 (s), 21.6 (q)]. In addition, the other carbon signals were assigned to six methenes including three oxy-methines (δC 81.7, 73.7, 78.2) and six methylene carbons including one oxy-methylene (δC 63.9), and three quaternary carbons (δC 61.7, 46.1, 33.1). Considering the diterpenoids previously isolated from the plant, 1a was tentatively presumed to be a 7,20-non-epoxy-ent-kaurane skeleton, substituted with two hydroxyl groups and two acetoxyl groups.The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data of 1a were nearly identical to that of henryin, a known diterpene, and the only difference found was in the moiety at C-14. The compounds 1a was a 14-acetylated compound of henryin. This hypothesis was further confirmed by the HMBC spectra of 1a. In the HMBC spectrum (Fig. 2), the correlations for δH 5.99 (H-14) with δC 146.3 (C-16), δC 207.0 (C-15) and δC 170.2 (-OOCCH3) revealed that the hydroxyl group at C-14 in henryin [δC 75.8; 4.78 (1H, s)] had been replaced by an acetoxyl group in 1a [δH 1.99 (3H, s); δC 170.2 (s), 21.6 (q)]. Thus, the basic skeleton of 1a was assumed to be 1,7-dihydroxy-14,20-diacetoxy-ent- kaur-16-en-15-one. The relative configuration of the substituents was highlighted in a NOESY spectrum. The correlations of H-1 with H-5 and H-9, Me-18 with H-5, H-7 with H-5 and H-9, and H-13 with H-14 and H-16 indicated that H-1, H-5, H-7 and H-9 were positioned on the same side and that H-13, H-14 and H-16 were on the other side (Fig. 3). To determine the absolute configuration, the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum of compound 1a was measured in MeOH and compared with the computed ECD spectra of 1a. The calculated curve matched well with that of the experimental curve (Fig. 4). According to the octant rule for saturated cyclopentanone, the negative Cotton effect at 247.94\\\\u2009nm, based on the n-π* transition of the saturated cyclopentanone moiety, indicated that the D ring was β-oriented (Fig. 4). Finally, the structure of compound 1a was elucidated as 1α,7α-dihydroxy-14β,20-diacetoxy-ent-kaur-16-en- 15-one (Fig. 1).Compound 1b was a white powder. The molecular formula of 1b was determined to be C24H34O7 by positive HRESIMS (m/z 457.21774 [M\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009Na]+, calcd for C24H34O7Na+, m/z 457.21967). The UV, IR, 1H, 13C-NMR, HSQC and HR-ESI-MS spectra of 1b, together with the results from an HMBC experiment, showed that 1b was an isomer of 1a. Comparing the NMR data of 1a and 1b (Table 1). It can be found that the substituents on C-7 and C-14 were exchanged in 1a and in 1b. An acetoxyl group and a hydroxyl group were at C-7 and C-14 in 1b, respectively. It was also found that in the HMBC spectrum (Fig. 2), there were correlations between δH 5.38 (H-7) and δC 51.8 (C-5), δC 45.6 (C-10) and δC 168.2 (7-CH3COO-), and δH 4.79 (H-14) and δC 55.7 (C-9), δC 205.7 (C-15) and δC 146.1 (C-16). Thus, the planar structure of 1b was assumed to be 1,14-dihydroxy-7,20-diacetoxy-ent-kaur-16-en-15-one. The same relative stereo-structure for 1a and 1b was deduced from their similar NOESY correlations (Fig. 3) and their almost identical 1H- and 13C-NMR data. In addition, compound 1b exhibited almost the same CD absorption as that of 1a. The calculated curve was in good agreement with that of the experimental curve (Fig. 4). Thus, the structure of 1a was determined to be 1α,14β-dihydroxy-7α,20-diacetoxy-ent-kaur-16-en-15-one (Fig. 1).Compound 2a was obtained as a white powder, and its molecular formula was determined to be C24H34O7 by positive HRESIMS (m/z 457.21756 [M\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009Na], calcd C24H34O7Na+, m/z 457.21967). The UV spectrum of 2a showed an absorption maximum at 235\\\\u2009nm. The IR spectrum of 2a showed the presence of hydroxyl (3445\\\\u2009cm−1), carbonyl (1730 cm−1) and double bond (1648 cm−1) groups. Together with the NMR data of 2a, the results showed 2a was also an analogue of 1a. Comparing the NMR data of compounds 1a and 2a (Table 1), it was found that the substituents on C-1 and C-20 were exchanged for 1a and 2a, respectively. The acetoxyl and hydroxyl groups were at C-1 and C-20 in 2a, respectively. In the HMBC spectrum (Fig. 2), δH 4.62 (H-1) correlated with δC 25.4 (C-2), δC 47.3 (C-10), δC 55.9 (C-9) and δC 169.1 (1-CH3COO-); δH 4.44 (H-20β) correlated with δC 55.9 (C-9), and δH 4.23 (H-20α) correlated with δC 84.1(C-1). Thus, the planar structure of 2a was assumed to be 1,14-diacetoxy-7,20-dihydroxy-ent-kaur-16-en-15-one. The relative configuration of the substituents of 2a was determined with the NOESY spectrum. The correlations of H-1 with H-5 and H-9, Me-18 with H-5, H-7 with H-5 and H-9, and H-13 with H-14 and H-16 indicated that they were positioned on the same side and that H-14, H-13, and H-16 were on the other side (Fig. 3). In addition, compound 2a exhibited almost the same CD absorption as that of 1a. The calculated curve matched well with that of the experimental curve (Fig. 4). Thus, the structure of 2a was determined to be 1α,14β-diacetoxy-7α,20-dihydroxy-ent-kaur-16-en-15-one (Fig. 1). Compound 2b was a white powder, and its molecular formula was determined to be C24H34O7 by positive HRESIMS (m/z 457.21799 [M\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009Na]+, calcd for C24H34O7 Na+, m/z 457.21967). The UV, IR and HR-ESI-MS spectra, together with the NMR data of 2b, showed that 2b was an isomer of 2a. Comparing the NMR data of compounds 2a and 2b (Table 1), it was found that the substituents on C-7 and C-14 were exchanged with each other. An acetoxyl group and a hydroxyl group were at C-1 and C-20 in 2a, respectively. In the HMBC spectrum (Fig. 2), δH 4.62 (H-1) correlated with δC 25.4 (C-2), δC 47.3 (C-10), δC 55.9 (C-9) and δC 169.1 (1-CH3COO-); δH 4.44 (H-20β) correlated with δC 55.9 (C-9); δH 4.23 (H-20α) correlated with δC 84.1 (C-1). The NOESY and CD experiments showed that the configuration of the substituents of 2b is the same as that of 2a (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, the structure of 2b was assumed to be 1α,7α-diacetoxy-14β,20-dihydroxy-ent-kaur-16-en-15-one (Fig. 1).\\', \\'ref_66:The final products were identified as new naproxen analogs. The structure of derivative 1 was established based on its spectroscopic data. Its molecular formula was determined as C16H18O3 on the basis of the ion peak at m/z 258.1256 [M]+ and 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1). The 13C NMR spectra (Supplementary Material S2) showed 16 resonances distributed as six singlets, six doublets, and four quartets. When compared to those of vulgarin, on the one hand, it could be observed that compound 1 lacked the two triplets, resonating in vulgarin at ẟC 23.0 and 34.6, and the three aliphatic doublets, resonating in vulgarin at ẟC 54.9, 79.9, and 52.7. On the other hand, compound 1 possessed two aromatic doublets, ẟC 124.7 and 123.2, and three more aromatic singlets, ẟC 133.6, 122.7, and 138.6, suggesting the aromatization of rings A and B and the opening of lactone ring, ring C. Moreover, compound 1 showed two oxygenated quartet resonances at ẟC 52.3 and 55.7. Those two carbons correlate, in the HSQC spectra (Supplementary Material S4), to two proton singlets resonating at ẟH 3.89 and 3.59, respectively, indicating the presence of two methoxy groups. The HMBC spectra (Supplementary Material S5) showed a correlation between the methoxy group resonating at ẟH 3.59 and assigned to C-16, and C-12 of the carbonyl group resonating at ẟC 175.3, proving the presence of a methyl ester group. The second methoxy group, on C-14, resonating at ẟH 3.89 as a singlet, showed a cross peak correlation, in the HMBC spectra, with an aromatic singlet carbon resonating at ẟC 154.3 which was assigned to C-1. Other HSQC and HMBC data showed the absence of the angular methyl group on C-14 in vulgarin.The data suggested a concerted sigmatropic 1,3 shift of the methyl group on C-14, from C-10 to the oxygen atom on C-1, during the dienone-phenol rearrangement, with the subsequent aromatization of ring A. The 1H NMR spectra of 1 showed five resonances in the aromatic region, one methine quartet in the aliphatic region (ẟH 3.84, H-11), in addition to three methyl singlets (ẟH 2.52, 3.59, and 3.89, H-15, 16, and 14, respectively), and a methyl doublet (ẟH 1.53, H-13).Likewise, derivative 2 was assigned the molecular formula C16H20O3 as derived from the molecular ion peak at m/z 260.1404 [M]+ and the NMR data (Table 1). The 13C NMR spectra (Supplementary Material S9) revealed that compound 2 was similar to 1, except for the presence of two triplet resonances, ẟC 24.4 and 21.0, which were assigned as C-8 and C-9, respectively. These assignments were aided by the HMBC spectra (Supplementary Material S12) that showed a correlation between C-8 (ẟC 24.4) and a proton resonating as a quartet at ẟH 3.30 which was assigned as H-11. Consequently, H’s-8 were assigned at ẟH 2.16. The COSY spectrum (Supplementary Material S14) showed coupling contours between H-8 and the other two protons resonating at ẟH 2.68 and 2.74, which were assigned as H’s-9. The C-9 (ẟC 21.0) assignment was concluded from the HMBC spectra. Other carbon resonances of 2 were identical, or close to those of 1 (Table 1).The derivatives were produced via an iodine-catalyzed aromatization mechanism, where molecular iodine (I2) decomposed to generate the acidic conditions (HI) needed for dienone-phenol rearrangement to occur, with the successive aromatization. The used protic solvent, MeOH, facilitated the formation of HI acid that protonated the oxygen of the carbonyl group, resulting in the four-centered concerted reaction, 1,3-methyl sigmatropic shift, that ended up with the formation a double bond between C-1 and C-10, as seen in the reaction scheme (Scheme 1).Additionally, the acid-catalyzed dehydration of the hydroxy group on C-4 led to the aromatization of ring A. Simultaneously, the iodine-catalyzed lactone opening produced a double bond between C-6 and C-7 in ring B, followed by esterification to afford the methyl ester as derivative 2 (Scheme 1). Furthermore, the intermediate iodirane may undergo several iodination and dehydroiodination steps that lead to a complete aromatization, followed by esterification to produce derivative 1 (Scheme 1).\\', \"ref_67:Terpenoids, the largest family of natural products, exhibit a diverse array of biological activities and potential applications in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. These compounds primarily originate from two basic C5 units: isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP, C5) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, C5). Prenyltransferases (PTs) catalyze the consecutive condensation reactions between allylic substrates and IPP units, resulting in acyclic precursors. These precursors are then transformed by terpene cyclases (TCs) into cyclic and acyclic terpenoids. Based on the differences in catalytic reactions that eliminate the prochiral proton from the C-2 position of IPP, PTs can be classified into two families, trans-PTs and cis-PTs. cis-PTs are further classified into four classes by the length of the carbon chain in their final products, including short-chain (C10-C20), medium-chain (C30-C60), long-chain (C65-C120), and rubber synthase (>C10,000). The first cis-PT identified is the undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS), a medium-chain cis-PT, from Micrococcus luteus B-P 26. UPPS utilizes farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and IPP in a chain elongation process to generate a C55 polyisoprenoid with di-E, poly-Z configuration, which acts as indispensable glycosyl carrier for bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. Subsequent research has uncovered additional cis-PTs, such as neryl diphosphate (NPP, C10) synthase (NDPS1), (Z,Z)-FPP synthase (zFPS), and nerylneryl diphosphate (NNPP, C20) synthase (NNPS). These cis-PTs utilize DMAPP to produce cis-prenyl diphosphates, which are then catalyzed by TCs to generate various cyclic terpenes including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes, some with unique carbon frameworks. This suggests the potential of cis-prenyl diphosphates as precursors in terpenoid biosynthesis, crucial for the diversification of terpene structures. However, to date, there has been no characterization of cis-PTs responsible for the biosynthesis of cis-C25 prenyl diphosphates.The primary and tertiary structures of cis-PTs are completely different from those of trans-PTs, such as FPP synthase, which consist entirely of α-helices. In contrast, the archetypal crystal structure of homodimeric UPPS reveals a novel \\'butterfly-like\\' topology, comprising of a pairing domain and a catalytic domain with a central six β-sheets flanked by seven α-helices. Furthermore, UPPS is characterized by a large hydrophobic cleft on the surface of each subunit, a structural feature hypothesized to accommodate the elongating prenyl chain during the condensation reaction. Rv1086 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the first characterized short-chain cis-PT and a (Z,E)-FPP synthase, provides insights into chain-length specificity. Investigations by Noike et al. highlighted residue L84\\'s significance in determining chain length, while L85 and L90 also appeared to contribute. This correlation was similarly observed in UPPS, where mutations at the corresponding sites resulted in varied prenyl chain lengths. Additionally, Ambo et al. discovered the significance of I59 in Rv1086 for substrate specificity and chain-length determination. These results suggested that site-directed mutagenesis at these critical residues allows for modulation of the product\\'s chain length and profile. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of cis-PTs, which produce a spectrum of products, represents a significant obstacle for the biosynthesis of cis-prenyl diphosphates derived terpenoids and the synthetic biology of cis-polyisoprenoids. Therefore, precise manipulation of cis-PT\\'s product specificity through engineering holds promise for solving these challenges. In this study, we report the identification and crystallographic determination of the first cis-geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus. ScGFPPS is shown to utilize DMAPP, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), and FPP as allylic substrates, catalyzing reactions with IPP to produce six distinct E-Z-mixed prenyl diphosphates. For the strategic bioengineering of ScGFPPS\\'s product distribution, we resolved the high-resolution crystal structure of NNPS from Solanum lycopersicum. Through target site-directed mutagenesis, we successfully obtained eight mutants of ScGFPPS that showed high product specificity.\", \\'ref_68:During the initial visual screening process, approximately 200 candidates were selected from about 8 × 105 colonies obtained by chemical mutagenesis of the zea1 strain with EMS on the basis of their yellowish-green coloration. After pigment profile analysis by HPLC, three mutants (mut6, mut9, and mut12) were selected on the basis of their relative zeaxanthin per chlorophyll a content (Figure S1). These mutants lacked neoxanthin, violaxanthin, and antheraxanthin, but accumulated considerable amounts of zeaxanthin, similar to the parental strain (zea1). From the preliminary results of zeaxanthin content and growth pattern, mut12 had the highest zeaxanthin content and growth, and was therefore used in all further experiments. This mut12 was renamed macular pigment mutant 3 (mp3) according to its pigment profile characteristics.Cell growth and zeaxanthin content in the wild type, and zea1 and mp3 mutants, were measured under three different light conditions. Increased irradiation promoted cell division in the wild type, zea1, and mp3 (Figure 4). Interestingly, the growth rate of mp3 was dramatically changed by light intensity (Table S2), increasing significantly from that at mid-light conditions. When the mp3 mutant was grown under low-light conditions (65–85 μmol photons·m−2·s−1), its specific growth rate was only 0.46 d−1; however, it increased to 1.18 d−1 under mid-light conditions (140–160 μmol photons·m−2·s−1). Much stronger light (580–620 μmol photons) did not further affect the growth rate of mp3 (1.21 d−1). This pattern was also observed in the wild type and zea1, as strong light did not affect the growth rate (0.97 d−1 and 1.11 d−1, respectively) in comparison with mid-light conditions. Specific growth rates were calculated during the same periods of the exponential phase for the wild type, zea1, and mp3. Carotenoid content is presented in Table 2. Dunaliella strains, investigated in this study, tended to have high pigment content under low-light conditions. However, zeaxanthin yield (mg·L−1) of the mp3 and zea1 strains under low- and mid-light conditions was higher than that under high-light conditions. Interestingly, mp3 had a 42% higher zeaxanthin yield than zea1 under high-light conditions (Figure 4D). Daily zeaxanthin productivity of mp3 was 0.271–0.400 mg·L−1, which was 3–4 times higher than the productivity of the wild type under all light conditions.To improve the yield of zeaxanthin and to determine its maximal yield, repeated fed-batch cultivation was performed in a 200 mL flask-culture system. Maximum zeaxanthin concentrations in repeated fed-batch cultures of mp3 and zea1 were 3.7 times and 3.4 times those in single-batch cultures, respectively (Figure 5B). This could be the result of the higher cell density observed in fed-batch cultures (Figure 5A). In detail, the maximum zeaxanthin yield of mp3 was 8 mg·L−1, which was about 20% higher than that of zea1 (6.5 mg·L−1). For a better comparison of zeaxanthin concentration between the two culture systems for the mp3 strain, the amount of pigment per 106 cells was calculated. Data analysis was performed with samples that had the highest zeaxanthin content during the experiment period. In fed-batch culture, it was 0.365 µg at 11 days after inoculation, which was about 15% higher than the content in single-batch culture (0.318 µg at 9 days), indicating that repeated fed-batch cultures may increase zeaxanthin yield and accumulation.\\', \\'ref_69:Heimionone A (1) was isolated as a yellow oil from the mycelial extracts of liquid cultures. Based on an HRESIMS analysis, its molecular formula was assigned as C22H28O5 according to the molecular ion cluster at m/z 373.2012 [M + H]+ (calcd. for C22H29O5 373.2023) indicating nine degrees of unsaturation. 1H NMR and HSQC data (Table S6) led to the identification of six methyls at δH 1.02 (s, H3-12), 1.13 (s, H3-11), 1.40 (d, J = 6.3 Hz, H3-15), 1.77 (s, H3-7′), 1.82 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, H3-6′), and 2.31 (s, H3-13), three oxymethines at δH 4.70 (q, H-14), 5.14 (s, H-9), and 6.12 (s, H-1), and five olefinic methines at δH 5.81 (d, J = 15.7 Hz, H-2′), 6.07 (q, H-5′), 7.35 (d, J = 15.7 Hz, H-3′), 7.56 (d, J = 9.8 Hz, H-4), and 7.69 (d, J = 9.8 Hz, H-5). The 13C and HMBC NMR data (Table S6) revealed the presence of 22 carbon resonances, including two carbonyl carbons (δC 187.5, C-7; 168.6, C-1′); ten sp2-hybridized carbons, comprising five nonprotonated carbons (δC 153.0, C-2; 152.4, C-3; 151.7, C-6; 146.1, C-8; 135.3, C-4′) and five methines (δC 152.6, C-3′; 139.2, C-5′; 138.6, C-5; 131.8, C-4; 115.1, C-1′); one quaternary carbon (δC 45.5, C-10); three methines (δC 84.2, C-9; 83.5, C-1; 67.8, C-14); and six methyl carbons (δC 26.1, C-15; 22.3, C-13; 20.7, C-12; 20.5, C-11; 14.8, C-6′; 11.9 C-7′). The carbonyl and sp2-hybridized carbons accounted for seven degrees of unsaturation, suggesting two rings in the scaffold of heimionone A (1). By analyzing the 1H-1H COSY data, the first spin system was given due to correlations between H3-13, H-5, H-4, H-14, and H3-15. Correlations between H3-11/H3-12, H2-9, and H-1 led to the identification of the second spin system. HMBC correlations from H3-13 to C-4/C-5/C-6/C-7/C-8 and H-4 to C-2/C-3/C-5/C-6/C-7/C-8 revealed a cyclohepta-3,5,8-triene-7-one ring. The 14-hydroxyethyl moiety was deduced from the HMBC correlations of H3-15 to C-3/C-14. Further HMBC correlations from H3-11 and H3-12 to C-1/C-9/C-10, from H-9 to C-2/C-8/C-10/C-11, and from H-1 to C-2/C-8/C-9/C-10/C-11 led to the identification of a dimethylcyclopentane substructure that was fused to the cyclohepta-3,5,8-triene-7-one ring across C-2 and C-8. HMBC correlations from H3-6′ to C-3′/C-4′/C-5′/C-7′ and from H-3′ to C-1′/C-2′/C-4′/C-5′/C-7′ revealed the presence of a 4′-methylhexa-2′,4′-dienoic acid partial structure that was fused to C-1 according to an HMBC correlation from H-1 to C-1′. The E ∆2′,3′ configuration was assigned according to the large coupling constants (J = 15.7 Hz) between the olefinic methines H-2′ and H-3′, while the ∆4′,5′ configuration was assigned as E due to the ROESY correlation between H-3′ and H-5′. Furthermore, this structural elucidation was supported by the comparison of the 1H and 13C data to the ones of daldinin F (Figure S17 and Table S11), which was reported to carry the same side chain as heiminone A. The relative configuration of the bicyclic core was obtained by the evaluation of ROE data. Due to the key correlation between H-1 and H3-12, these protons were arbitrarily assigned to the α face of the molecule. A correlation between H-9β/H-11 indicated an β orientation of these protons. Finally, the absolute configuration was determined by Mosher’s method. The derivatization of heimionone A (1) to its corresponding R- and S-MTPA esters at position C-9 and C-14 was done with S- and R-MTPA chloride. The pattern of ∆δS,R chemical shifts (see Figure 3) with positive values of H-4, H-5, H3-11, and H3-12, and negative ones of H3-13 and H3-15 determined the 1S,9R,14S absolute configuration.The yellow oil heimionone C (3) was isolated from the mycelial extracts of liquid cultures with a molecular formula of C22H30O4, implying eight degrees of unsaturation. Analysis of the 1H and 13C spectra showed similarities to those of 1 and 2. HMBC and COSY interactions confirmed the presence of the previously described dimethylcyclopentane substructure carrying a 4′-methylhexa-2′,4′-dienoc acid partial structure that was fused to C-1. A spin system was given based on 1H-1H COSY correlations among H3-14, H-6, H2-5, H2-4, H-3, and H3-15. Furthermore, HMBC correlations from H3-14 to C-6/C-7/C-8, H2-4 to C-3/C-5, and H3-15 to C-2/C-3/C-4 led to the identification of the 3,7-dimethylcycloocta-6,9-dien-8-one ring that was fused to the dimethylcyclopentane ring across C-2 and C-9 according to correlations from H-1/H-3/H3-15 to C-2 and from H-1/H-10/H3-12 to C-9. The relative configuration was deduced by an analysis of ROE data. Due to the key correlations among H-1α/H-4α/H-5α/H3-13/H3-15, these protons were arbitrarily assigned to the α face of the molecule. Correlations between H-3β/H-4β/H-5β and between H-10β/H3-12 indicated a β orientation of these protons. Finally, the absolute configuration was determined after heimionone C (3) was derivatized to its corresponding S- and R-MTPA esters at position C-10 in the course of Mosher’s method. The ∆δSR chemical shift pattern (see Figure 3) indicated R-configuration of C-10 and thus a 1S,3R,10R absolute configuration.Compounds 3–5 can be assigned to the asteriscanes according to their characteristic four methyl groups on the five-eight-membered ring system. Although the bicyclo [5.3.0] decane scaffold of 1 and 2 is part of daucane-, isodaucane, aromadendrane, lactarane-, africane, gualane-, nor-guaiane and pseudoguaiane-type sesquiterpenoids, the methyl pattern of 1 and 2 with its germinal demethylation of C-10 is different from those. Thus, the carbon backbone of 1 and 2 can be regarded as a new scaffold. Nevertheless, nardoguaianone E-I with similar structures were previously described after isolation from Nardostachys chinensis. Interestingly, asteriscane-type sesquiterpenoids have been isolated from the soft coral Sinularia capillosa.\\', \\'ref_70:The *ent*-8-labdene derivatives **1a** and **1b** were identified in 12 samples (WS-A/D and RS-1, 5/11). Four specimens (WS-F/ H and RS-3) contained the known clerodane derivative **2**, whereas the mono- and diacyl glycerides (**3a** and **3b**) with a halimane residue were identified in WS-E and RS-2. The stereochemistry of **2** is reported as 5*S*,8*S*,9*R*,10*S* in agreement with Baker, McClintock and coworkers who have recently determined the absolute stereochemistry of the related compound **8** in specimens of *A. kerguelenensis* collected along the Western Antarctic Peninsula.[6e] Together with **2**, the fractionation of the extract of RS-2 yielded two other terpene glycerides (**4** and **5**). Compound **4** (ESI<sup>+</sup> MS *m*/*z* 401.2658 for C23H38O4 + Na+) is a deacetylated isomer of (+)-anisodorin-1 isolated from the North Atlantic nudibranch *Anisodoris fontaini*. [8] The optical rotation of **4**, [*α*]D = +32, is in agreement with the dextrorotatory sign of anisodorin-1 and other known isocopalane glycerides.[9] Compound **5** showed an ESI<sup>+</sup> pseudomolecular ion at *m*/*z* 445.2930 (C25H42O5 + Na+). In addition to the resonances of the disubstituted glycerol (*δ* = 5.11, 2--H; *δ* = 4.31 and 4.23 ppm, 1--H2; *δ* = 3.75, 3--H2) and the acetyl residue (*δ* = 2.08 ppm), the <sup>1</sup> H NMR spectrum indicated the presence of five methyl groups and an AB system due to magnetically nonequivalent methylene protons (*δ* = 2.36 and 2.19 ppm, 14-H2) α to a carbonyl moiety. COSY and TOCSY cross-peaks between 12-H2 (*δ* = 1.36–1.19), 13-H (*δ* = 1.88 ppm), 14-H2 (*δ* = 2.37–2.18) and Me-16 (*δ* = 0.95 ppm) established the structure of the pendent alkyl chain of six carbons. On the contrary, the substitution pattern of the bicyclic ring was inferred from HMBC experiments, which indicated correlations between the allylic protons at *δ* = 2.04 (2-H2) and the olefin carbon atoms at 144.8 (C-4) and 120.2 ppm (C-3), as well as between the deshielded methyl group at *δ* = 1.58 (18-H3) and the quaternary carbon atom at *δ* = 38.5 ppm (C-5). The angular methyl group at *δ* = 1.04 (19-H3) showed a correlation with this last carbon atom together with C-10 (*δ* =45.6 ppm) and C-6 (*δ* = 30.1 ppm). The other methyl singlet at *δ* = 0.88 (C-20) revealed long-range cross-peaks with the methyne carbon atom at *δ* = 45.6 ppm (C-10) and the quaternary carbon atom at *δ* = 37.0 ppm (C-9). Finally, correlation of this signal with the methyl doublet at *δ* = 0.90 (C-17) completed the assignment in agreement with the presence of a clerodane skeleton analogous to that of palmadorin C (**9**).[6e] However, the amount of the purified compound was not sufficient for the determination of the absolute stereochemistry of **5**.The analysis of another specimen from the Ross Sea (RS-4) led to the identification of two unprecedented pairs of glycerides (**6a**/**6b** and **7a**/**7b**), both showing labdane residues related to compounds previously reported in terrestrial plants. The <sup>1</sup> H NMR spectrum of **6a** (ESI<sup>+</sup> *m*/*z* 443.2759 [M + Na+] for C25H40O5) contained five methyl singlets (*δ* = 0.75, 0.85, 0.87, 1.77 and 1.93), one acetyl group (*δ* = 2.08 ppm) and a distinct pattern of downfield shifted signals accounting for the glycerol (*δ* = 5.10, 2--H; *δ* = 4.29 and 4.26 ppm, 1--H2; *δ* = 3.75, 3--H2) and the olefinic protons 14-H (*δ* = 5.68 ppm) and 7-H (*δ* = 5.40 ppm). The methylene group at C-6 (*δ* = 1.98 and 1.85) correlated to this last signal and to the methine at *δ* = 1.20 (5-H). In agreement with the depicted structure of **6a**, HMBC crosspeaks between Me-17 (*δ* = 1.77 ppm) and C-6 (*δ* = 23.8 ppm), C-7 (*δ* = 122.4 ppm) and C-9 (*δ* = 55.2 ppm) defined the right side of the bicyclic residue. Other heterocorrelations of Me-20 (*δ* = 0.75 ppm) with C-1 (*δ* =39.1 ppm), C-5 (*δ* = 50.2 ppm), C-9 and C-10 (37.0), as well as of Me-18 (*δ* = 0.87 ppm) and Me-19 (*δ* = 0.85 ppm) with C-3 (*δ* =42.3 ppm) and C-5 (*δ* = 50.2 ppm), completed the assignment of the *trans* decaline ring. COSY and TOCSY couplings established the spin system 9-H/12-H and, together with the HMBC correlations of the substituted α,β-unsaturated ester residue, determined the structure of the side chain originating at C-9. The chemical shifts of C-9 (*δ* = 55.2 ppm), C-10 (*δ* = 37.0 ppm), C-17 (*δ* = 22.2 ppm) and C-20 (*δ* = 13.5 ppm) were in excellent agreement with the *trans*-*anti* configuration of the eperuane skeleton,[10] thus determining the relative stereochemistry of **6a**. The corresponding 2-eperuanyl-*sn*-glycerol (**6b**) (ESI<sup>+</sup> *m*/*z* 401.2669 [M + Na+] for C23H38O4) showed an identical pattern of signals with the exclusion of the protons at C-1- that, due to the absence of the acetyl group, were upfield shifted at *δ* = 3.84 and overlapped the resonance of 1--H2. The <sup>1</sup> H NMR spectra of the monoacyl glyceride **7a** (ESI+: *m*/*z* = 443.2767) indicated a 8(17),13-labdadiene derivative similar to verrucosin-5 (**10**), one of the glycerides previously described from the Mediterranean *Doris verrucosa*. [11] However, in addition to the differences of the glycerol resonances, the proton NMR spectroscopic data of the two molecules showed changes in the proton chemical shifts of Me-20 (*δ* = 0.93 in **7a**; *δ* = 0.69 in **10**) and 7-H2 (*δ* = 2.19 and 2.06 ppm **7a**; *δ* = 2.39 and 1.97 ppm **10**). Analysis of the 13C resonances demonstrated further differences in the two compounds. In particular, the axial orientation of the alkyl chain at C-9 could be inferred for **7a** on the basis of the upfield shift of C-5 (*δ* = 45.6 ppm in **7a**; 55.5 ppm in **10**) and C-7 (*δ* = 31.6 ppm in **7a**; 38.3 ppm in **10**). The stereochemistry of this substituent was also in accordance with the downfield shift of Me-20 (*δ* = 22.5 ppm in **7a**; 14.5 ppm in **10**), whereas the resonances of Me-18 and Me-19 remained substantially unaffected in agreement with the 5,10-*trans* configuration of a 9-*epi*-labdane residue. This assignment was further confirmed by the similarity of the <sup>1</sup> H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data between **7a** and 9-*epi*-*ent*-8(17),12*Z*,14-labdatriene reported by Garbarino and Molinari from a terrestrial plant of the genus *Calceolaria*. [12] The structure of **7b** (ESI+: *m*/*z* = 401.2663) was established by comparison of the <sup>1</sup> H NMR spectroscopic data with **7a** (see Table 2). The absolute stereochemistry of these compounds remains undetermined even if biogenetic considerations (Scheme 1) may suggest a 9-*epi*-*ent*-labdane skeleton.Extracts of the antarctic molluscs contained many other minor compounds that could not be identified unequivocally and therefore are not reported here. However, in line with the structure differences emphasized by the NMR results, chromatographic profiling of single individuals revealed variable mixtures of isomeric glycerides (not shown). When analyzed by LC–MS in positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mode, the terpenoyl glycerides of these fractions gave a distinct fragmentation pattern arising from cleavage of the ester functional group. As shown in Figure 1, the process resulted in the formation of terpene ions for the loss of 91 (C3H703) or 133 (C5H904) from mono- and diacyl glycerides, respectively. Secondary fragmentation depended on the structure of the terpene residues but generally α,β-unsaturated ester (i.e. **1**) or tricyclic skeleton (i.e. **4**) gave detectable ion products due to α-cleavage. NMR and MS information, together with differences in retention time and UV maxima, permitted us to discriminate between six different terpene residues in the chromatographic separation of the extracts of the 21 specimens (Table 3). Combination of these data with the random presence of the sesquiterpene austrodoric acid supports the existence of several diverse terpene chemotypes within the same population (Table 3). Except for the specimen RS-2, which contained derivatives with more than one skeleton, each nudibranch is univocally associated with a single type of terpene glyceride. However, different compounds with isomeric arrangements of the same skeleton were also identified in RS-4. Terpene glycerides are the major components of lipidic extracts of *A. kerguelenensis* (roughly 0.07 mg per mg of extract) and the combination of the above data is sufficient to define the terpene fingerprinting of the major metabolites occurring in the Antarctic specimens. However, we cannot exclude that minor derivatives could have been overlooked during this study. In two specimens (WS-I and WS-L, see Supporting Information), the chemical data were not sufficient to determine the structures of the compounds. Nevertheless, every specimen revealed presence of terpene glycerides thus confirming the strict specificity of the chemical pattern in these dorid molluscs.\\', \"ref_71:A number of structural and computational studies of terpenes have been conducted to explore the molecular basis in the terpene biosynthesis pathway.37−41 Based on the first crystal structure of cis-PTs reported by Fujihashi and co-workers,42 researchers articulated the enzyme\\'s architecture and the chain elongation mechanism.26,43 Notably, Tantillo and co-workers performed detailed quantum mechanical dynamics simulations of the terpene formation44,45 and proposed the reaction mechanism of a triquinane forming sesquiterpene synthase from chamomile by combining computations and deuterium-labeling experiments.46 Merz et al. explored the substrate selectivity and product regioselectivity of PTs in Orf247 as well as the conformational activation of FTase prior to the catalytic reaction.48 As GPPS is responsible for the critical initial stage of consecutive assemble chain elongation reactions, elucidating its catalytic mechanism is highly important and will help the development of new technology in generating novel natural productlike scaffolds. Unfortunately, there has been no report on the assembly mechanism of DMAPP and IPP catalyzed by GPPS until now. FPPS, as a well-studied and important target for the treatment of parasitic diseases such as Chagas disease and African trypanosomiasis,49−53 is referential for the mechanistic study of GPPS, since they share similar active site structures as discussed above. Figure 3 summarizes the catalytic mechanisms of IPPS proposed so far. Poulter et al. (Scheme 1 in Figure 3) were the first to suggest the essential \\'ionization−condensation−elimination\\' three steps for assembly reactions in 1970s, in which the heterolytic cleavage of the C1′−O7′ bond of DMAPP yields a cationic carbon which subsequently attacks the sp2 carbon C4 of IPP, and finally a hydrogen atom on C2 of IPP is eliminated to form GPP.12,13,54,55 Specifically, Cornforth and co-workers confirmed that the last elimination step is the deprotonation of IPP (HR of C2) based on the nonenzymatic experiment in aqueous solution (Scheme 1 in Figure 3).56,57 So far, three major reaction mechanisms for FPPS have been proposed (Scheme 2 in Figure 3), and none is widely accepted.32,34,57,58 The earliest one is the concerted mechanism (namely \\'one-step reaction\\'), where the ionization, condensation as well as elimination procedures were assumed to occur synchronously with only one transition state.56,58 The theoretically predicted reaction barrier is 26.4 kcal/mol with the difference of the C1′−O7′ and C1′−C4 bond distances chosen as the reaction coordinate.59 Alternatively, the \\'two-step reaction\\' mechanism treats the condensation step and the elimination step as concerted.59−61 The last mechanism is the \\'three-step reaction\\' mechanism, where the ionization−condensation−elimination processes are stepwise.32,34 All of the above three reaction mechanisms concur that the final eliminated proton is HR but not HS of IPP, and HR is then transferred to the PPV cleaved from DMAPP in the first \\'ionization\\' reaction.56 In this work, Born−Oppenheimer density functional QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations with umbrella sampling, a state-of-the-art approach to simulate enzyme reactions,62−65 have been performed to characterize the C5−C5 units (DMAPP and IPP) assembly reaction catalyzed by Mp-GPPS. Instead of favoring any of the three existing and controversial mechanisms for FPPS, our computations suggest that the protonation of DMAPP is the key as it triggers the subsequent ionization state is determined and the catalytic roles of the conserved residues and the two Mg2+ ions in the active site are delineated.Similar to our previous classical MD simulations, the crystal structure of MP-GPPS (PDB code: 3KRO) for the heterotetrameric geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) from mint (Mentha piperita) complexed with the nonhydrolyzable DMAPP analog dimethylallyl thiopyrophosphate (DMASPP) was selected for the present study at the QM/MM theoretical level. The spherical boundary condition was applied, and the atoms more than 22 Å away from the C1′ atom of DMAPP were fixed. Since the ligands coordinated to metal ions are not involved in the subsequent reaction steps after \\'ionization,\\' different QM/MM partition schemes were considered for different reaction steps/mechanisms to reduce computational costs (see Figure S1). For the ionization step, the QM part is composed of DMAPP, IPP, Asp83, Asp89, Lys180, two Mg2+ ions, and five water molecules coordinating with Mg2+ ions. For the condensation and elimination steps, the QM part involves DMAPP, IPP, His76, and Mg2+ ions. All the QM subsystems were treated by the density functional theory B3LYP with the 6-31+G* basis set for the oxygen atoms of DMAPP/IPP and the 6-31G* basis set for all other atoms. Benchmark tests confirmed the reliability of B3LYP/6-31(+)G* for this reaction. The QM/MM boundaries were described by the pseudobond approach with improved pseudobond parameters. All remaining atoms were described with the Amber99SB force field at the MM level. More detailed descriptions of the computational setups and procedures can be found in the Computational Methods section of the Supporting Information or similarly in our previous computational protocols. To track the reaction of assembling isoprenoid building blocks, various combinations of reaction coordinates (RCs) were chosen (see Figure S2), and all these density functional QM/MM simulations were performed with the modified QChem-Tinker programs.\", \\'ref_72:Linear PEG is the most widely used nonionic polymer because of its high aqueous solubility in the field of polymer-based drug delivery, but it is limited by its low drug-binding capacity. Here, 8arm-PEG-COOH was selected due to its high drug-loading capacity compared with linear PEG. The 8arm-PEG–DHA was synthesized by an esterification reaction between the carboxyl group of 8arm-PEG-COOH and the hydroxyl group of DHA. In addition, the targeting ligand, TF, was introduced to 8arm-PEG–DHA conjugate via a coupling reaction (Fig. 1a,b).Figure 2a–c show the 1H-NMR spectra of DHA, 8arm-PEG–DHA and TF-8arm-PEG–DHA, where the signals at 0.80–2.90 are attributed to the most characteristic peak protons of DHA, those at 3.40–3.85 (4\\\\u2009nH, –(CH2CH2O)n–) and 4.20 (2H, –CH2OC(O)O–) to the methylene protons of PEG, and those at 0.81–1.30 are attributed to the proton peaks of TF. The doublet around 4.78 (1H, CH) of DHA moving to 5.82 (1H, CH) in 8arm-PEG-DHA spectra indicated successful synthesis of ester bonds between PEG and DHA. In addition, the proton peaks of TF and 8arm-PEG-DHA were chemically shifted due to the steric effect. CH2 (non-repeat molecular of PEG-DHA) was shifted from 4.06 to 3.97 because the macromolecule as a TF was introduced to the carboxyl group of PEG in 8arm-PEG-DHA.Loading content of nanoparticle is an important factor to be considered for researches in vitro or in vivo. Compared to the traditional linear PEG, the drug-loading capacity was obvious increased due to the 8arm-PEG was selected. The mass ratio of 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs calculated by HPLC were 15.12% and 10.39%, and the molar ratio was 6.26\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.52, 93.39\\\\u2009±\\\\u20097.56, respectively (Table 1). For the determination a bradford protein assay with pure holo-transferrin as standard was applied for the determination of the average amount of TF that conjugated to the 8arm-PEG-DHA. The calculated coupling efficiency was 1\\\\u2009mg TF/2\\\\u2009mg 8arm-PEG-DHA conjugate.The synthesized polymeric conjugates, such as 8arm-PEG-DHA and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA, have amphiphilic characteristics due to the hydrophilic portion as a PEG and hydrophobic portion as a DHA. These amphiphilic characteristics can form nanoparticles by self-aggregation and consisted of a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell in an aqueous environment. As shown in Fig. 3, the particle size distribution and morphology of 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs (Fig. 3a,c) and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs (Fig. 3b,d) were indicated. The particle size distribution and morphology were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and TEM. 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs showed a unimodal and narrow particle size distribution (Fig. 3a,b), and had a spherical shape. The particle size was lists in Table 1. When TF was conjugated to 8arm-PEG-DHA, the particle size was increased from 112.42\\\\u2009±\\\\u200917.28\\\\u2009nm to 147.64\\\\u2009±\\\\u200921.36\\\\u2009nm. The increasing particle size of the nanoparticles was observed by both DLS and TEM.Generally, DHA has poor solubility in aqueous solutions; the solubility of DHA in water is less than 0.1\\\\u2009mg/mL. Therefore, the use of DHA can cause side effects due to the excipient, such as Cremophor EL (CrmEL). In this study, to overcome the poor solubility of DHA in aqueous solutions, the polymeric nanoparticles were prepared with PEG and TF, which are hydrophilic molecules. This resulted in an obvious increase in the solubility of DHA. The concentration of each sample (DHA, 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs, and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs) was based on the amount of that DHA (final DHA concentration: 10\\\\u2009mg/mL). The transmittances of DHA, 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs, and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs were 0.95%, 90.24%, and 96.70% at 210\\\\u2009nm, respectively (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 4, the hydrophilic molecular-introduced 8arm-PEG-DHA and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs showed a significant increase in solubility whereas the free DHA was opaque. In addition, TF-conjugated TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs showed higher solubility than the other samples, such as DHA and 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs. This shows that the hydrophilicity of DHA was increased due to the introduction of hydrophilic molecules, indicating that the prepared novel nanoparticles can obvious increase the solubility of DHA.The release of DHA from nanoparticles in PBS was analyzed to affirm that hydrolysis of the ester bonds would occur. The nanoparticles were first placed in PBS solutions to simulated biological fluids, and the rates of hydrolysis were measured by HPLC analysis. The stability of the nanoparticles was determined in PBS solutions at pH 7.4 and pH 4.5 to simulate the cytoplasmic/extracellular space and the lysosome, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a,b, 8arm-PEG–DHA NPs and TF-8arm-PEG–DHA NPs very slowly hydrolyzed and released the DHA at a weakly acidic or neutral pH without the common burst release phenomenon. However, the hydrolyzed DHA displayed a preferential release under weakly acidic conditions (pH 4.5). This accelerated release under acidic conditions was attributed to the re-protonation of the hydroxyl group of DHA. Providing the route that NPs after transferrin modification, they would be typically fuses to an early endosome, and then be trapped in lysosomal after cellular uptake through transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis, the acid-facilitated release can be a benefit to the enhanced cytotoxicity. However, in the presence of esterase, which is abundant in cytoplasm, all the nanoparticles quickly hydrolyzed and released the DHA. The resulting hydrolysis data appear in Fig. 5. The curves in Fig. 5 represent best first-order fits to the data, and the half-lives for these curves are given in Table 1.Once a method of measuring free DHA was established for drug released from the newly synthesized nanoparticles, it was necessary to confirm that the liberated drug maintained its cytotoxic activity. To examine the cytotoxicity of DHA and the nanoparticles, a CCK-8 assay was conducted after incubating cells treated with different formulations. The response of LLC and A549 cells were tested in vitro by seeding the cells and exposing them to various concentrations of PBS, free DHA, 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs for 24, 48 or 72\\\\u2009h. Analysis of in vitro cytotoxicity measurements showed that DHA (0.2\\\\u2009μg/mL) induced cell death, which was dependent upon length of incubation. As shown in Fig. 6a,b, the time-dependent cytotoxic effect of the TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs was evident, which indicated that 41.8% LLC and 62.7% A549 cells survival after 24\\\\u2009h, 23.4% LLC and 49.1% A549 survival after 48\\\\u2009h, only 19.2% LLC and 33.2% A549 survival after 72\\\\u2009h (the concentration equivalent to native DHA). As shown in Fig. 6c,d, the cell viability of 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs decreased with increasing DHA concentration, and there were no significant differences between the two nanoparticles to A549 cells. At the lowest concentration (0.2\\\\u2009μg/mL), 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs exhibited efficient anti-tumor effects. In particular, TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs showed the highest anti-tumor efficiency at all concentrations. This suggests that the TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs uptake by the cells is higher than 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs due to receptor-mediated endocytosis.To compare the potency of nanoparticles, a drug concentration corresponding to 50% death of the cells (IC50) was estimated from survival curves in Fig. 6c,d, obtained from replicate experiments. The IC50 of 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs were slightly greater than free DHA (Table 2), and ranked as 8arm-PEG-DHA\\\\u2009>\\\\u2009TF-8armPEG-DHA\\\\u2009>\\\\u2009DHA. The IC50 of 8arm-PEG-DHA and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA complex stated in this article refer to DHA equivalents. For example, the IC50 of TF-8arm-PEG-DHA complex is 1.17μg/ml means that the concentration contains 1.17\\\\u2009μg/ml of DHA and 11.26\\\\u2009μg/ml the whole TF-8arm-PEG-DHA complex, here the loading of DHA in the TF-8arm-PEG-DHA complex is 10.39\\\\u2009wt%.In order to further evaluate the role of transferrin in the cellular uptake of TF-8arm-PEG–DHA NPs, LLC cells and MLE-12 cells were employed as transferrin receptor (TFR) overexpressing cancer cells and TFR deficiency cancer cells, respectively. The cells were incubated with the nanoparticles (0.2\\\\u2009μg/mL) in culture medium containing increasing concentrations of free transferrin as described previously with minor modification. The cytotoxicity of TF-8arm-PEG–DHA NPs against LLC cells was inhibited by excess free transferrin, and the cell viability increased with increasing transferrin concentration (Fig. 7a). However, their cytotoxicity against MLE-12 cells did not change as a function of transferrin concentration (Fig. 7b). For instance, the cell viability of TF-8arm-PEG–DHA NPs against LLC cells was approximately 35.8% for TF-8arm-PEG–DHA NPs and free transferrin concentrations of 0.01\\\\u2009μg/mL, but it was about 68% in the presence of 100\\\\u2009μg/mL free transferrin. These findings suggest that free transferrin molecules prevent the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles by competitive binding to TFR on the cell surface.The cellular uptake of FITC labeled NPs were evaluated using flow cytometry. The TF-modified NPs showed significantly enhanced cellular uptake compared to non-targeted NPs suggesting the importance of TF modification (Fig. 8a,b). As shown in Fig. 8c, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs was 251.05, however, TF-modified 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs was 1250.60 (~5 fold compared with 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs), indicating that cellular uptake of NPs was significantly increased after TF modification.Longer blood circulation time can offer nanoparticles more opportunities to reach the tumor site, and thus enhanced the therapeutic effect. The determined drug concentration after hydrolysis under basic condition was actually the total DHA in plasma. The plasma clearance curves of free DHA and nanoparticles in mice were shown in Fig. 9a. Disappearance of DHA from the blood circulation after intravenous administration was very rapid with the plasma concentration below 20% of injected dose per gram (% ID/g) at 3\\\\u2009h. 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs removed a little slowly from the circulating system compared to free DHA, but the drugs were almost undetectable (8% ID/g) after 30\\\\u2009h. On the contrary, TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs exhibited a remarkable prolonged clearance with the drug levels of 16% ID/g at 30\\\\u2009h after administration. The half-time of free DHA in blood was only 1.3\\\\u2009h, while that of 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs, and TF-8armPEG-DHA NPs was significantly increased (5.9\\\\u2009h and 9.0\\\\u2009h, respectively), indicating that TF-8armPEG-DHA NPs could greatly prolong the circulation time in the blood (Fig. 9b).The results described above gave us great confidence to evaluate the anticancer effectiveness of nanoparticles in a mouse tumor model. During the treatment period, tumor growth of mice was not significantly inhibited by free DHA because of the poor solubility and bioavailability, as expected the tumor growth rates of mice treated with 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs were both slower than that of free DHA and control group, indicating favorable antitumor effects. Interestingly, TF-8arm- PEG-DHA NPs treatment exhibited greater tumor volume inhibition and survival benefit than 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs owing to the target ligand TF (Fig. 10a). As shown in Fig. 10b, the groups treated with free DHA and different nanoparticles showed varied levels of survival time and they were ranked as TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs\\\\u2009>\\\\u20098arm-PEG-DHA NPs\\\\u2009>\\\\u2009DHA, which was consistent with the results of tumor growth inhibition. The treatment with TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs resulted in 84.6% TGI (day 20) and 83.3% survival of animals (day 26). In contrast, the free DHA treatment resulted in 29.9% TGI (day 20) and 16.7% survival of animals (day 26) (Fig. 10a,b, Table 3). Importantly, in line with the literature, no signs of systemic toxicity were observed by monitoring general behavior, appetite and mice body weight (Fig. 10d). These results provide evidence that the combination of the PEG and the tumor cell targeting ligand of TF endowed TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs with significantly improvement in antitumor therapeutic efficacy.Although the nanoparticles showed significant therapeutic effects in vivo, whether it had non-negligible adverse effects remained a critical issue. During the early development, type-1 hypersensitivity is the most common type of the hypersensitivity reaction. Some of the natural anticancer drugs, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, and teniposide cyclosporine, were usually associated with a high incidence of type-1 hypersensitivity reaction. It has been demonstrated that IgE antibodies play an important part in mediating type-1 hypersensitivity responses. We thus selected IgE levels as the parameter for rapid evaluation of type-1 hypersensitivity reactions. The blood IgE levels of mice in different groups (DHA, 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs, and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs) are shown in Fig. 10e. Mice treated with DHA displayed a higher IgE level than the PBS group, which might be ascribed to the poor solubility. As expected, no significant change of IgE level was observed in the 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs groups, which explored the idea that the use of nanoparticles could reduce the risk of hypersensitivity reactions substantially. The blood of mice after treatment with different groups were also collected to test the white blood cell (WBC) count, which is often used as an indicator of hematologic toxicity. The total WBC count of mice treated with DHA showed an obvious decrease over the normal group (Fig. 10f). No discernible decrease in WBC number of the mice treated with 8arm-PEG-DHA NPs and TF-8arm-PEG-DHA NPs were observed, indicating that the nanoparticles could avoid severe hematotoxicity.\\', \\'ref_73:MeOR_X1 and MeOR_X2 were the putative proteins showing the highest identity compared to OR proteins from several plants (Table 1). Their potential implication in carotenoids accumulation was investigated. First, RNA was extracted from cassava roots using yellow genotype Y1. Then, RNA was reverse-transcribed and the genes MeOR_X1 and MeOR_2 were sequenced alongside MePSY2 and MePSY1 using the primers shown in S2 Table. Subsequently, their sequences were compared with the sequences of those genes found in the cassava reference genome to search for potential SNPs. For this, an alignment using Clustal Omega was carried out. In total, 13 SNPs were found in the CDS regions, 7 synonymous and 6 non-synonymous (Table 2). Non-synonymous substitution T580A was found in MeOR_X1, G3A and A152T in MeOR_X2, A1154C and A1213C in MePSY1, and C572A in MePSY2, respectively. The first SNP in MeOR_X2 (G3A) was positioned in the start codon ATG. The G3A substituted a methionine for an isoleucine residue generating MeOR_X2 G3A, with a new downstream start codon at position 172 which results in a protein which is N-terminally truncated by 57 amino acids. Interestingly, the new start codon coincided with the start of different OR proteins producing a protein with a MW of 34.4 kDa. Moreover, a cTP in MeOR_X2 was not predicted by ChloroP while a cTP was predicted for the protein encoded by MeOR_X2 G3A, similar to MeOR_X3 and MeOR_X4 (S3 Table). The second non-synonymous SNP in MeOR_X2 (A152T) was located in the sequence area deleted by the modification in the start codon. A full alignment can be found in S3–S6 Files.To study whether the non-synonymous SNPs were exclusive from yellow lines, a differential diversity analysis in a broad germplasm collection consisting of 330 genotypes including white lines and colored lines was carried out (S1 File). Approximately 10 million high-quality SNP variants were retained after filtering. Among them, 12 out of the initially identified 13 loci of interest were found. Among the white genotypes, the reference alleles predominated for MePSY1 and MePSY2. Conversely, in the yellow genotypes, the frequency of SNP1 (A1154C) of MePSY1 and, remarkably, SNP2 (C572A) of MePSY2 increased. On the contrary, the frequency of the alleles with the SNPs in the MeOR genes was high in both the white and colored genotypes, mainly in the homozygous form. The SNP3 (A1213C) could not be identified in the variation of the 330-sample population.To study the potential involvement of OR proteins in carotenoids accumulation, two yellow-fleshed cassava genotypes (Y1 and Y2, respectively) and one white-fleshed genotype 60444 (W) as a reference white line with poor carotenoids accumulation were used (Fig 2A). A higher carotenoids accumulation was confirmed in the yellow genotypes and β-carotene was the most abundant carotenoid (Fig 2B).The expression levels of MeOR_X1, MeOR_X2, MeOR_X4, MePSY1, and MePSY2 were analyzed by real-time qRT-PCR (Fig 2C). However, MeOR_X1.2 and MeOR_X3 were not amplified by real-time qRT-PCR using specific primer pairs, although endogenous controls (histidine and ubiquitin) were amplified as expected in the samples. The expression levels of MeOR_X1, MeOR_X2 and MeOR_X4 remained unchanged compared to the white roots. Likewise, the expression levels of MePSY2 remained unchanged for genotype Y2, while in Y1 a significant decrease was observed. Conversely, MePSY1 levels were up to 4-fold higher in both yellow genotypes compared to the white genotype. To study a possible alteration in β-carotene downstream metabolism, the expression levels of cassava BCH1 and 9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED3), the enzyme catalyzing ABA synthesis in cassava, were analyzed (S2 Fig). The expression levels of BCH1 were lower in both yellow genotypes compared to the white one although significantly only in Y2. NCED3 expression levels decreased up to 5- and 4-fold in the two yellow varieties, respectively.Protein amount was analyzed by western blot using polyclonal antibodies (Fig 2D). For OR, one band with a MW of approximately 29 kDa was observed in both the white and the yellow genotypes, with significantly higher amounts in the yellow ones (S3 Fig). On the contrary, one band corresponding to a MW of around 34 kDa was observed exclusively in the yellow genotypes. No changes were observed between the white and yellow genotypes for PSY proteins, which present similar predicted sizes of approximately 48 kDa (Fig 2D).To investigate a direct implication of OR for the accumulation of carotenoids in cassava, the cassava OR variant MeOR_X1 and the ZmPSY1 were overexpressed in cassava FEC from genotype 60444 individually or combined in a tandem arrangement (MeOR_X1+ZmPSY1). Maize PSY1 was used in expression and co-expression experiments as this PSY variant performed best in an array of PSYs from different taxa in rice endosperm and is frequently used in overexpression experiments. The transformation with just MeOR_X1 produced the least intense orange color compared with those transformed with ZmPSY1 and ZmPSY1 + MeOR_X1 (Fig 3A). The FEC co-transformed with MeOR_X1+ZmPSY1 showed the most intense orange color. Freshly isolated protoplasts were used to visualize the formation of crystals. No carotenoid crystal formation was appreciated in the FEC protoplasts from the control and MeOR_X1 lines. Conversely, crystals were formed in the ZmPSY1 line. Noticeably, a massive accumulation of carotenoid crystals was observed in the co-transformed with ZmPSY1 + MeOR_X1 (Fig 3B). FEC transformed with MeOR_X1 showed poor carotenoids accumulation, whereas the callus co-transformed with MeOR_X1+ZmPSY1 presented the highest carotenoids accumulation, up to 3-4-fold higher compared to the FEC transformed with ZmPSY1 alone (Fig 3C), β-carotene was the most abundant, but, interestingly, a higher level of other carotenoids was noted compared to the roots profile. While the expression levels of MeOR_X1 were comparable in callus transformed with MeOR_X1 alone and the callus co-transformed with MeOR1_X1 and ZmPSY1, ZmPSY1 levels were around 4-fold higher in callus co-transformed with MeOR1_X1 and ZmPSY1 compared with the FEC transformed with ZmPSY1 alone (Fig 3D). Thus, the levels of ZmPSY1 expression might explain most of the carotenoid content changes, while MeOR1_X1 co-expression levels had only a minor contribution.\\', \\'ref_74:**acid hydrolysis and determination of sugar configuration in compounds 1 and 2** Each compound (1 mg) was hydrolyzed with 2 M HCl (0.5 mL) for 1.5 h. After removing the solvent by nitrogen blowing, the residue was dissolved in pyridine (500 μL) and reacted with L-cysteine methyl ester HCl (5 mg) at 60 °C for 1.5 h. Then O-tolyl isothiocyanate (25 μL) was added to the mixture and reacted at 60 °C for an additional 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC (SunFire C18 5 μm, 4.6×150 mm; 20% CH3CN–0.1% formic acid water to 35% CH3CN–0.1% formic acid water, 0–25 min, 1 mL/min). The sugar was identified as D-glucose in compounds 1 and 2 (tR, 15.98–16.04 min) [authentic samples, D-glucose (tR, 16.35 min) and L-glucose (tR, 15.01 min)].Compound **2** had the molecular formula C25H34O13, as established by its HRESEMS ([M − H]−, *m/z* 541.1926, calcd for C25H33O13, 541.1921), The IR absorptions at 3431 and 1729 cm−1 indicated the existences of hydroxy and carbonyl groups. The <sup>1</sup> H-NMR spectrum of **2** (Table [1](#page-1-1)) displayed signals ascribable to an olefinic proton (*δ*H 6.28, s), five oxygen-bearing methines (*δ*H 5.21, dd, *J*=8.8, 4.2 Hz; *δ*H 4.99, m; *δ*H 4.34, d, *J*=6.2 Hz; *δ*H 3.70, m; *δ*H 3.57, d, *J*=4.2 Hz), two singlet methyls (*δ*H 1.43; 1.22), two doublet methyls (*δ*H 1.20, d, *J*=6.8 Hz; 1.17, d, *J*=6.8 Hz), and a glucose unit. The <sup>1</sup> H- and 13C-NMR data of **2** quite resembled those of compound N3 in the patent [[13](#page-7-10)]. The HMBC correlations from H-3 (*δ*H 4.34) to C-1′ (*δ*C 105.9), as well as from H-1′ (*δ*H 4.50) to C-3 (*δ*C 76.0), supported the connection of the glucose moiety at C-3. In the ROESY spectrum, the correlations of H-1/H-3, H-2/H-3, H-3/CH3- 18, H-5/CH3-18, H-6/CH3-18, and H-6/H-7 suggested the α-orientation of H-1, H-2, H-3, H-5, H-6, H-7 and CH3-18 (Fig. [2\\\\\\\\)](#page-2-1). Additionally, compound **2** showed Cotton effects (215.5 nm, Δ*ε* +9.6; 239.5 nm, Δ*ε* −0.7) similar to those of compound **1**, indicating the same absolute configuration of their core skeleton. Thus, the structure of nagilactone N3 3-*O*-β-d-glucoside was identified (Fig. [1\\\\\\\\)](#page-1-0). Compounds **3** and **4** were isolated as a 6:5 mixture. Both compounds were assigned the molecular formula of C19H24O7 by its HRESIMS *m/z* 363.1456 [M− H]− (calcd for C19H23O7, 363.1444), with 8 degrees of unsaturation. The 1 H-NMR spectra of **3** and **4** (Table [1](#page-1-1)) displayed two sets of almost superimposable resonances, each ascribable to two singlet methyls, two doublet methyls, a pair of geminal protons, a septet proton, four oxygenated methines, an olefinic proton, and two active protons. The septet proton and two doublet methyls indicated the presence of a typical isopropyl group in the structures of **3** and **4**. In the 13C-NMR spectra of compounds **3** and **4** (Table [2](#page-2-0)), two sets of resonances were also observed. After careful analysis, the 1 H- and 13C-NMR data of **4** inferred it as nagilactone B [[11](#page-7-8), [14\\\\\\\\]](#page-7-11). Thus, compound **3** was deduced to be a stereoisomer of **4**. The relative configuration of **3** was inferred from the ROESY experiment. The ROESY correlations of H-5/H-6, H-6/H-7 and H-6/H3-18 indicated that H-5, H-6, H-7, and H3-18 were on the same side and α-oriented. Furthermore, the ROESY correlations between H-1 and H-5, and between H-2 and H3-20, indicated the hydroxy groups at C-1 and C-2 as being β- and α-oriented, respectively (Fig. [2\\\\\\\\)](#page-2-1). Therefore, the structure of **3** was established as shown, and named 2-epinagilactone B. All the isolates were tested for their anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. First, MTT assay was carried out to evaluate the non-cytotoxic concentrations of these two compounds on RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. [3a](#page-3-0) and Supplementary Fig. S22, the maximum safe dosages for compounds **1**, **2**, and a mixture of **3** and **4**, were 1.25, 2.50 and 5.00 μM, respectively. Nitric oxide (NO), a key mediator and regulator of inflammatory responses, is mainly produced in macrophages by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The anti-inflammatory effect the podolactones was evaluated by LPS-stimulated NO production in RAW264.7 cells. The results showed compounds **1** and **2** significantly inhibited NO production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. [3b](#page-3-0)), with IC50 values of 0.18±0.04 and 0.53±0.03 μM, respectively. While, the mixture of **3** and **4** did not show inhibitory effects on LPS-induced NO production up to 10 μM (Supplementary Fig. S22). Indomethacin (IC50 4.21±0.32 μM) was used as a positive control. Further studies indicated compound **1** and indomethacin suppressed iNOS expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. [3c](#page-3-0)). The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway is a key regulator of inflammatory response. NF-κB dimers are located in cytosol under normal conditions, combining with its inhibitor protein IκBα. In response to inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS, NF-κB is activated through the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα by the IKK (IκB kinase) complex. The activated NF-κB dimer dissociates from IκBα and subsequently translocates to the nucleus, where it induces the expression of various inflammatory genes, including iNOS [\\\\\\\\[15](#page-7-12)]. As expected, LPS increased the phosphorylation of IKKα/β, IκBα, and p65 remarkably, which was reversed by compound **1** treatment (Fig. [4a](#page-4-0)). The immunofluorescent staining results showed compound **1** suppressed LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65 (Fig. [4](#page-4-0)b). These results demonstrated that compound **1** suppressed the activity of NF-κB signaling pathway to exert its anti-inflammatory effect. Taken together, compound **1** was found to suppress LPS-induced activation of IKKα/β, IκBα and p65, and prevent the translocation of NF-κB/p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus, resulting in reduction of iNOS expression. These data suggested podolactones might be a new class of inhibitors of the NF-κB signaling pathway.\\', \\'ref_75:Carotenoids are tetraterpenes serving a multitude of functions in plants as essential photosynthetic pigments, substrates for phytohormone biosynthesis and colorants of fruits and flowers contributing to sexual reproduction of plants (Yuan et al.; Baranski and Cazzonelli). Carotenoid biosynthesis in plants has become very well established and extensively reviewed in the past decades (Cazzonelli et al.; Wurtzel). In contrast, knowledge on carotenoid catabolism, initiated by oxidative cleavage of their polyunsaturated hydrocarbon backbone, has only improved more recently and is a key determinant of steady-state carotenoid levels. In most tissues, flux through carotenoid biosynthesis is by far higher than the steady-state levels observed, a fact that supports the significance and extent of carotenoid turnover (Simkin et al.; Lätari et al.; Koschmieder et al.). The research focus has long been on enzymatic carotenoid catabolism by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) and nine-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs), initiating biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), strigolactones and other novel bioactive compounds, but also leading to non-specific cleavage yielding apocarotenoids of different chain lengths (Hou et al.; Wang and Bouwmeester; Moreno et al.). Several lines of evidence have put a spotlight on non-enzymatic oxidative degradation. In chloroplasts, photooxidation was reported to be the predominant carotenoid degradation process, producing apocarotenoids as light stress signals (Simkin et al.; Beisel et al.; Ramel et al.; Lätari et al.). Moreover, knockout of CCD1 and CCD4 genes, previously thought to be key to carotenoid catabolism, barely affects steady-state carotenoid levels (Gonzalez-Jorge et al.; Lätari et al.). Lastly, in vitro and in planta investigations suggest that non-enzymatic carotenoid oxidation yields polymeric aggregates, called co-polymers, most likely representing the largest portion of degraded carotenoid in high carotenoid tissues such as carrot roots or Golden Rice endosperm (Britton; Burton et al.; Schaub et al.; Mogg and Burton). Co-polymers slowly decompose by scission to yield apocarotenoids and many short-chain metabolites upon secondary cleavage of remaining double bonds and further metabolism.Aiming at investigating this largely unknown metabolism downstream of apocarotenoid formation, we recently analyzed roots of Arabidopsis plants which accumulate dramatically increased amounts of β-carotene (Koschmieder et al.). This was achieved by overexpression of the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the carotenoid pathway, phytoene synthase (PSY), which is frequently applied also in biotechnological applications to increase the provitamin A content (Paine et al.; Welsch et al.; Bai et al.; Diepenbrock et al.). Using carotenoid-accumulating Arabidopsis roots, we found that β-apocarotenoids which represent reactive electrophile species (RES) with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moieties are metabolized by a set of enzymes so far known as detoxifiers of reactive carbonyl species (RCS; Fig. 1). These enzymes convert aldehydes/ketones into less reactive and less toxic alcohols, carboxylic acids or a,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Namely, these are aldehyde dehydrogenases ALDH3H1 and ALDH3I1, aldo–keto reductases AKR4C8 and AKR4C9 and the 2-alkenal reductase AER (Mano et al.; Yamauchi et al.; Mano). However, mechanisms responsible for subsequent metabolization of apocarotenoids or apocarotenoids modified by the enzymes identified remain unexplored. Glutathionylation of apocarotenoids at the α,β-unsaturated double bond by glutathione (GSH) S-transferases (GSTs) might represent an effective detoxification mechanism, which would tag apocarotenoids for further degradation as known for other compounds, e.g., oxilipins (Davoine et al.). Interestingly, 11 out of 23 Arabidopsis GSTs of the tau subfamily (GSTU) are reported to mediate glutathionylation of RCS such as acrolein or 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal in vitro (Mano et al.). However, the substrate specificity of most plant GSTs remains unknown. Additionally, non-enzymatic glutathionylation of many compounds such as oxylipins and alkenes occurs even at physiological pH without catalysts in vitro (Esterbauer et al.). Considering the above similarities between RCS and apocarotenoid metabolism and considering that β-apocarotenoids as well as many RCS are lipophilic hydrocarbons, the formation of apocarotenoid–GSH adducts appears plausible, but there is scarce experimental evidence for this. For instance, non-enzymatic glutathionylation of the C10 apocarotenoid citral in vitro was reported (Esterbauer et al.) and a specific GST was shown to be capable of binding zeaxanthin in human macula (Bhosale et al.). An alternative degradation mechanism for (apo)carotenoids is their oxidative cleavage into very short-chain compounds. We reported that transgenic Arabidopsis calli and roots accumulating β-carotene and β-apocarotenoids also accumulate the reactive carbonyl species methylglyoxal (C3) and glyoxal (C2) (Schaub et al.; Koschmieder et al.), potentially representing terminal oxidation products of β-carotene and/or carotenoids in general (Fig. 1). These products have been confirmed as oxidation products of β-carotene in vitro under ozonolysis (Benevides et al.). Upon oxygen exposure of synthetic β-carotene, many compounds including methylglyoxal, glyoxal and the central metabolites pyruvic acid and succinic acid were reported to appear, their occurrence coinciding with β-carotene co-polymerization (Mogg and Burton). However, methylglyoxal and glyoxal are ubiquitous, highly cytotoxic compounds produced both enzymatically and non-enzymatically from several pathways which complicates their traceability from an apocarotenoid origin (Yadav et al.; Hoque et al.). Methylglyoxal and glyoxal are mainly detoxified via the GSH-dependent glyoxalase pathway yielding D-lactate and glycolate which are further fueled into the tricarboxylic acid and the Calvin–Benson cycle via the photorespiratory cycle, respectively (Thornalley; Maurino and Engqvist; Dellero et al.; Welchen et al.; Modde et al.; Schmitz et al.). In this work, we aimed at further investigating the largely unknown carotenoid metabolism downstream of apocarotenoid formation, based on our previously reported model system of transgenic Arabidopsis roots which over-accumulate β-carotene and β-apocarotenoids (Maass et al.; Álvarez et al.; Koschmieder et al.). We conducted comprehensive in vitro investigations as well as mass spectrometry-based metabolite analysis and transcriptome analysis in transgenic Arabidopsis roots to address the possible occurrence of non-enzymatic and GST-mediated enzymatic glutathionylation of β-apocarotenoids. A combination of different experimental approaches was used to further investigate the origin and fate of methylglyoxal and glyoxal from carotenoid degradation in planta and also the role of GSH in their detoxification. Our results suggest continuous breakdown and partial recycling of carotenoid-derived carbon via primary metabolic pathways and unravel a hitherto unrecognized function of enzymes predominantly associated with photorespiration in heterologous tissues.\\', \\'ref_76:CPK protein sequences of Arabidopsis and Glycine max were provided as direct queries against the G. uralensis genome to perform BLASTP and hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify the GuCPK gene family members. A total of 23 GuCPK genes were identified; hereinto, eight sequences of GuCPK2, GuCPK6, GuCPK9, GuCPK10, GuCPK13, GuCPK16, GuCPK17, and GuCPK22 showed spliced error as the incomplete assembly of the G. uralensis genome. According to the eight partial GuCPK sequences, we designed gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table S1) to obtain the full-length open reading frame (ORF) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All the 23 GuCPK ORF sequences were provided in Supplementary Table S2. The GuCPK ORFs ranged from 1482 to 2097 bp, and the encoded proteins of amino acids (aas) were in the range of 493 to 698 aa with molecular weight (MW) from 55.77 to 78.45 kDa, and the isoelectric points (pI) were from 5.18 to 9.22, and of the subcellular location predictions to the plasma membrane (Supplementary Table S3). Multiple sequence alignment analysis indicated that all of the 23 GuCPKs had high conserved domains, including a DLK motif, an autoinhibitory domain, and four Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs (Figure 1A), and a three-dimensional structure of these domains was performed to highlight the corresponding regions (Figure 1B). Our bioinformatic analysis revealed that 17 GuCPK proteins (the 23 GuCPKs except GuCPK8, GuCPK11, GuCPK13, GuCPK15, GuCPK18, and GuCPK20) harbored potential N-myristoylation sites, and 12 GuCPK proteins (GuCPK3, GuCPK4, GuCPK6, GuCPK7, GuCPK8, GuCPK10, GuCPK14, GuCPK16, GuCPK18, GuCPK21, GuCPK22, and GuCPK23) contained S-palmitoylation sites (Supplementary Table S3). For genomic location analysis, the 23 GuCPK genes were anchored onto 23 different scaffolds in the G. uralensis genome; four paralogous gene pairs (GuCPK1/GuCPK6, GuCPK4/GuCPK16, GuCPK8/GuCPK23, and GuCPK13/GuCPK15) were found to be segmentally duplicated (Figure 2). In order to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of GuCPK gene family members, a total of 96 CPK proteins from G. uralensis, Arabidopsis, and G. max were used to construct the phylogenetic tree, which indicated that the CPKs were clustered into four major groups (groups I–IV) (Figure 3). The GuCPK proteins had 12 conserved motifs distributing on different positions (Figure 4A). The exon/intron organization analysis indicated that the GuCPK members of different groups showed diverse gene structures (Figure 4B). This demonstrated that GuCPKs in the same group had highly conserved motif distributions and similar exon/intron structures. To investigate the expansion of the CPK gene family in G. uralensis, syntenic analysis of G. uralensis, Arabidopsis, and G. max was performed using the Circos software to visualize the results. Four segmental duplication events were identified, and the paralogue gene pairs were defined as the syntenic genes (GuCPK1/GuCPK6, GuCPK4/GuCPK16, GuCPK8/GuCPK23, and GuCPK13/GuCPK15), while no tandem duplication events were discovered as the incomplete assembly of the G. uralensis genome (Figure 5). The Ka/Ks ratio was used to evaluate the selection pressure for the duplicated GuCPK paralogue gene pairs. The results of the Ka/Ks ratios of the duplicated GuCPKs indicated that they have undergone purifying selection (Table 1). Meanwhile, the evolutionary rates of these duplication pairs were assessed by calculating the Tajima relative rate. The results showed that GuCPK4/GuCPK16 and GuCPK13/GuCPK15 had prominently accelerated evolutionary rates (Table 2).To investigate the regulatory feature of GuCPK genes, the isolated 1.5-kb sequence upstream of the translational start site of the GuCPKs was selected to analyze the constitutions of cis-acting elements. Besides the core elements of the putative TATA box and CAAT box, the GuCPK promoters mainly showed the regulatory elements of phytohormone responsiveness and stress responsiveness (Figure 6, Supplementary Table S4). The promoters of GuCPK1, GuCPK13, GuCPK15, GuCPK17, GuCPK19, and GuCPK22 contained an ACGT-containing abscisic acid (ABA) response element (ABRE) involving in the ABA responsiveness, suggesting potential regulation in the ABA-signaling pathway. The ethylene-responsive element (ERE) was detected in the promoter regions of GuCPK3, GuCPK10, GuCPK13, GuCPK15, GuCPK16, and GuCPK19, indicating the function of these genes in the ethylene-signaling pathway. Additionally, the gibberellin (GA) responsive elements (GARE and P-box) were found in seven GuCPK promoters. One or two v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) binding sites involved in flavonoid biosynthetic gene regulation elements (MBSI) were present in more than half of GuCPK promoters, providing a potential regulation function of GuCPK genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. TC-rich elements that participated in defense and stress responsiveness were discovered in nine GuCPK promoters that were classified in Cluster I and Cluster II. Moreover, the elements of anaerobic induction (ARE) and low-temperature responsiveness (LTR) were also observed in five GuCPK promoters. Several light-responsive elements, including mineralocorticoid response element (MRE), I-box, G-box, Box-I, AE-box, and 3-AF1 were shown in nearly all GuCPK promoters. These results demonstrated that GuCPK genes might perform diverse functions to regulate plant development and respond to environmental stresses through their involvement in hormonal signal transduction. Tissue-specific expression patterns of GuCPKs in different G. uralensis tissues were performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (Figure 7), with the gene-specific primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. The results that were visualized by qRT-PCR based heatmap showed that GuCPKs exhibited diverse tissue-specific expression features. GuCPK16 and GuCPK8 displayed the most accumulated expressions in roots, and GuCPK1, GuCPK9, GuCPK5, and GuCPK10 indicated higher expression in roots than in leaves and stems, implying their potential important functions in root development and related physiological metabolic process. GuCPK14, GuCPK6, and GuCPK2 demonstrated increased expressions in leaves, suggesting their possible role in leaf developmental and physiological process. In terms of the expressions in stems, GuCPK17, GuCPK9, GuCPK15, GuCPK8, as well as GuCPK1 and GuCPK11 indicated specific or dominant expressions. GuCPK13, GuCPK12, GuCPK7, GuCPK6, and GuCPK2 were enriched in roots and leaves than in stems. GuCPK22, GuCPK3, GuCPK23, and GuCPK21 were preferentially expressed in leaves and stems than in roots (Figure 7). Furthermore, the expression patterns of the GuCPK duplicated paralogous gene pairs were analyzed. The four duplication pairs had diverse expression profiles in different tissues, suggesting the four paralogous gene pairs shared their potential functional divergence after duplication events.\\', \\'ref_77:We initially designed a strain of S. 6803 to express the bisabolene synthase from A. grandis (Fig. 1), with the sequence codon optimized by GenScript for expression in S. 6803. This strain used the IPTG-inducible Ptic2op promoter and the RBS inherited from that promoter. After five days of growth in shake flasks under continuous light, this strain had produced 1.1 ± 0.08 mg/L bisabolene. According to the metabolic network of S. 6803 available in KEGG, the native terpenoid synthase pathway uses one enzyme to catalyze the production of geranyl pyrophosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. We hypothesized that this may result in low concentrations of farnesyl pyrophosphate in the cell, and that co-expression of a farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase may increase the production of bisabolene. We cloned the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase from E. coli, codon optimized by GenScript, into an operon downstream of the bisabolene synthase gene. Denoted ‘GS1x’, this engineered strain produced bisabolene at 1.6 ± 0.2 mg/L when grown in 45 mL BG-11 in shake flasks for five days. Since the strain that expressed both genes had a significantly higher bisabolene titer, we included farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase in all future strains.To further increase the product titer of bisabolene, we attempted to increase the expression of bisabolene synthase in S. 6803 by testing different codon optimized sequences and RBS sequences. In these designs, Ptic2op initiated transcription (when induced by addition of IPTG) of a bicistronic operon including a GenScript codon optimized sequences for A. grandis bisabolene synthase and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase from E. coli. This sequence, along with constitutively expressed lacY and lacI for Ptic2op induction/repression, was integrated into the slr0168 neutral site containing the mazF counterselection cassette. This cassette replaced the nickel-inducible counter-selection marker (mazF) and the kanamycin resistance gene, such that no selection marker was present in the final strain. No growth defects were observed due to either the presence of a dodecane layer or due to the expression of bisabolene synthase and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (see Supplementary Fig. 1). During the exponential growth phase, the specific growth rates were all between 0.09 and 0.11 hr−1, corresponding to a doubling time between 7.3 h and 6.1 h. Five codon optimization strategies were tested (the sequences are given in Table S2). The GenScript optimization of bisabolene synthase was described above, denoted ‘GS.’ IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies) codon optimization tool was utilized to optimize the bisabolene synthase gene, denoted ‘IDT,’ for S. 6803. A bisabolene synthase gene optimized by DNA2.0 for expression in Synechococcus p. PCC 7002 was provided as a gift from Dr. Fiona Davies. Strains using this sequence are denoted ‘2.0’. The free software, EuGene, was utilized to design two additional codon optimizations. One utilized only the harmonization algorithm, denoted ‘EuH’, which considers the codon usage frequency of the native host organism and attempts to match that frequency in the design for the target organism. This function was likely impaired by a lack of published gene sequences from A. grandis. Only 16 gene sequences were available from the Dendrome Project (now available at treegenesdb.org) to calculate codon usage for the native organism. Another sequence, denoted ‘EuHCR’, utilized the harmonization, codon context, and remove repeats rules. The five sequences have between 73% and 80% sequence identity. The codon adaptation index (CAI) compares the codon usage of a given gene sequence to the codon usage frequency of the organism. The GenScript optimization had the highest CAI at 0.89, while the DNA2.0, IDT, and EuH each had CAI between 0.76 and 0.71. The EuHCR-optimized gene had a CAI of 0.64. We measured the bisabolene titer of five strains of S. 6803 expressing each of the codon optimizations using identical promoters (Ptic2op) and the RBS inherent to the that promoter. After five days of growth in continuous light, the bisabolene titer of these strains varied from 0.1 ± 0.2 mg/L for the EuHCR strain to 1.6 ± 0.2 mg/L for the GenScript-optimized strain (see Fig. 2). The EuH, DNA2.0, and IDT optimized strains, which had similar CAI, also had similar bisabolene titers of 1.0 ± 0.2, 0.8 ± 0.2, and 0.7 ± 0.1 mg/L, respectively. Bisabolene titer and CAI were well correlated with an R2 value of 0.85 determined for the linear regression.RBSs were designed using the RBS Calculator forward engineering tool (free energy version v1.1) using the pre-sequence ‘GATAACAATT’ corresponding to the sequence of the Ptic2op promoter just 5′ of the RBS and transcription start site. The first 30 nucleotides of codon optimized bisabolene synthase sequence were entered as the gene sequence (see Table 1). Two RBSs were designed for each codon optimized gene sequence with a target expression level of 2000 (arbitrary units), or about ten times the expression level predicted by the RBS Calculator for the GS1x strain. After we constructed strains based on these designs, the RBS Calculator was revised (free energy version v2.1), and we recalculated predicted expression levels using the updated calculator. The translation initiation rates predicted by both versions of the calculator for each RBS used in this study are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Utilizing different RBSs for each codon optimization allowed us to reach a bisabolene titer of 7.9 ± 0.6 mg/L for one strain (2.0–10xB), though most strains generated titers between 0.4 and 2.7 mg/L, and the bisabolene concentration was below the detection limit in two cases (HCR10xA and HCR10xB) (see Fig. 3). Within each set of strains that used the same codon optimized bisabolene synthase, RBS sequences designed to have higher translation initiation rates either increased or decreased the bisabolene titer from the base case titer for that codon optimization. For example, one RBS sequence designed to have 10-fold higher expression than the base case GenScript codon optimization strain had a statistically similar titer, while the other actually had a lower titer of 0.9 ± 0.2 mg/L compared to 1.6 ± 0.2 mg/L. The strain with an RBS designed to have expression 100-fold higher than that for the same base case strain did achieve a higher bisabolene titer of 2.5 ± 0.4 mg/L. The two designed RBS for the EuHCR codon optimization resulted in strains that failed to produce detectable levels of bisabolene (corresponding to a titer of 0.01 mg/L). The RBS Calculator-predicted expression level only poorly trended with bisabolene titer (Fig. 4b). We compared the measured bisabolene titer to the relative bisabolene concentration for these strains using Western blotting to validate the assumption that bisabolene titer could be used as a proxy for gene expression. Bisabolene titer and relative bisabolene synthase concentration were well correlated (see Fig. 4). The relative bisabolene synthase concentration did not correlate as well with the RBS Calculator v2.1-predicted translation initiation rate, though this version did improve upon the previous version. A final Western blot containing a serial dilution of purified bisabolene synthase was used to estimate the fraction of total protein represented by bisabolene synthase in these samples. For the highest expressing strain, 2.0–10xB, bisabolene synthase was only 0.4 % of the total protein. The presence of bisabolene synthase and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase in the 2.0–10xB strain was also verified using LC-MS/MS (data not shown).Previously explored an important, but often overlooked, aspect of cyanobacterial metabolic engineering. Engineered strains are often tested in shake flasks under continuous light, though industrial cultivation is likely to occur outside and be subject to diurnal light fluctuations. They found that strains successfully engineered to produce higher titers of free fatty acids in continuous light lost all advantage over wild type cells with regards to titer when grown in 12:12 light-dark cycles. Since bisabolene is not produced by wild type S. 6803, we could only explore the impact of light-dark cycles on the mutant strains. Two strains, GS1x and 2.0–10xB, were grown in 12:12 light dark cycles for either 5 days or 10 days. When grown for 5 days in light-dark cycles, the titer of each was less than half of what it had been when grown for the same time period in continuous light (0.6 vs. 1.6 mg/L for GS1x and 2.6 vs 7.8 mg/L for 2.0–10xB, see Fig. 5). Growth in light-dark cycles for 10 days exposed the cultures to the same total amount of light as the 5-day continuous light cultures, and these cultures ended up with cell densities closer to the 5-day continuous light cultures than the 5-day light-dark cycle cultures. Both strains achieved higher titers of bisabolene (2.7 mg/L for GS1x and 9.7 mg/L for 2.0–10xB) when grown in 10-day light-dark cycles. The statistical significance of these comparisons is unclear when comparing on a specific titer basis. The specific titer of GS1x grown for 10-days in a light:dark cycle was higher than the 5-day continuous light culture, whereas, for 2.0–10xB, the 10-day light:dark cycle cultures had a similar titer to the cultures grown for 5-days in continuous light. Only for 2.0–10xB was the specific titer when grown in a 5-day light-dark cycle significantly different than when grown in a 5-day continuous light condition. The best-performing strain, 2.0–10xB, was grown in a 3 L photobioreactor containing 1.5 L BG-11, aerated with 200 mL min−1 5% CO2-enriched air, following the reactor setup and operation described by including simulated outdoor sunlight exposure for the photobioreactors. After six days, the titer reached 7.4 ± 0.8 mg bisabolene/L and plateaued (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the titer increased during stationary phase and reached 22.2 ± 1.0 mg bisabolene/L at 36 days. There was no significant stripping bisabolene from the dodecane layer due to the bubbling of gas through the reactor (data not shown).\\', \"ref_78:Deep administration of drugs to the nasal cavity approached nasal mucosa, leading to direct transmission of drug into the brain via the olfactory pathway, which consists of olfactory neurons with ability to carry drugs from olfactory mucosa to the brain. As reported, nanoparticles, as excellent platforms for direct delivery of drug to the brain after intranasal administration by protecting drug from biological and chemical degradation and inhibiting the efflux of P-glycoprotein, were designed to encapsulate and deliver various therapeutic agents across the olfactory pathway to the brain. It is unknown if the designed MC-PLGA-TP-NP was involved in the intracellular transport. We assumed that it could be based on literature mentioned above. Herein, we performed the transcellular permeability study on MC-PLGA-TP-NP through Caco-2 cells. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) shows the time profiles and the calculated Papp of TP or MC-PLGA-TP-NP permeation through the Caco-2 monolayer seeded on Transwell plates. The results demonstrated that free TP molecules exhibited better transcellular permeability than MC-PLGA-TP-NP at the beginning, whereas the amount of MC-PLGA-TP-NP increased sharply after incubation for 30 min. The level of determined TP in the basal chamber of the MC-PLGA-TP-NP group was 1.5-fold higher than that of the TP group at 120 min (Figure 3(a)). The Papp of free TP calculated using the equation of Artursson and Karlsson was 8.219 ± 1.145 × 10−6 cm/s, which was consistent with the data from Gong et al.. Obviously, The Papp of MC-PLGA-TP-NP was much higher (11.79 ± 2.242 × 10−6 cm/s, Figure 3(b)), indicating that the designed nanoparticles could enhance the transcellular permeability of TP. According to the design of Transwell™ permeable supports, it is expected that drug permeated by passive absorption through transcellular or paracellular mechanisms can be observed in the basolateral compartment. In this study, it is believed that the amount of TP determined in the basal chamber for both free TP and MC-PLGA-TP-NP can be attributed to the combination of passive transcellular and paracellular absorption mechanisms. In contrast, the higher TP amount in the basal chamber from MC-PLGA-TP-NP indicated that the multiple chemical coatings on the surface of nanoparticles can open intercellular junctions to accelerate the transcellular permeability of TP.Aβ peptides, predominantly Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42, are derived from the separation of the amyloid precursor protein. Plenty of evidence have shown that an abnormal deposition of Aβ peptides in plaques of the brain tissue could cause the loss of neurons and synaptic lesions, which was considered the primary cause of the pathogenesis of AD. At least partially, Aβ neurotoxicity is induced by oxidative stress. Hence, therapeutic effort for attenuating the oxidative stress could be beneficial to AD treatment. In the present study, we investigated the functions of TP and MC-PLGA-TP-NP in the cytotoxicity of Aβ1-42 on oxidative stress. Wang et al. reported that Aβ1-42 was cytotoxic to differentiated PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Herein, 5 μM Aβ1-42 as a final concentration was selected to induce the cytotoxicity for evaluating the protective effects of TP and MC-PLGA-TP-NP. As shown in Figure 4(a), Aβ1-42 obviously produced cytotoxicity without the protection of TP or MC-PLGA-TP-NP (0 ng/ml points), and only about 60% differentiated PC12 cells survived after incubation for 24 h. With the increase of TP dosage in the TP group, the viability of PC12 cells increased until the concentration of 5 ng/ml of TP reached, which was consistent with the results from Xu\\'s report. However, the viability of PC12 cells suffered from a rapid decrease to about 50% when the concentration of TP was raised from 5 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml, indicating that high dosage of TP could cause stronger toxicity and even reverse the protection effect. Notably, no obvious cytotoxicity was observed after the PC12 cells incubated with MC-PLGA-TP-NP in the whole range of prearranged concentrations. The reason may be that the sustained-release profile of MC-PLGA-TP-NP avoided the high dosage of TP interacting with cells. The results were acceptable and understandable because TP was a toxic chemical according to our previous study. Thus, the development of new TP preparation to reduce its toxicity is a necessity. It was reported that the protective functions of TP in AD may be via the pathway of oxidative stress. To evaluate the attenuation of the oxidative stress, the measurement of ROS generation closely associated with oxidative stress was carried out in this study. The results showed that the contents of ROS in the differentiated PC12 cells were increased significantly after the incubation with Aβ1-42 (p < 0.05). Fortunately, the levels of intracellular ROS in differentiated PC12 cells for the treatment of both TP and MC-PLGA-TP-NP were significantly reduced compared to the blank group which was treated with Aβ1-42 only (Figure 4(b)), respectively, indicating that the treatment of the differentiated cells with TP or MC-PLGA-TP-NP can attenuate oxidative stress induced by Aβ1-42. There was no significant difference between the TP and MC-PLGA-TP-NP group (p > 0.05). Taken together, the designed MC-PLGA-TP-NP can exert an attenuation of the oxidative stress without any cytotoxicity to the differentiated PC12 cells. Ca2+ is known as a second messenger in organisms, of which the disequilibrium is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Aβ can disrupt the calcium channels in cellular membrane, enhancing Ca2+ influx and then leading to the disequilibrium of calcium. Subsequently, the overload of intracellular Ca2+ is able to induce cytotoxicity and eventual cell death. To further prove the neuroprotection of MC-PLGA-TP-NP, its effect on calcium influx of differentiated PC12 cells after the treatment of Aβ1-42 was evaluated. The resulting fluorescence images were shown in Figure 5, among which the green fluorescence corresponded to calcium deposition stained by Fluo-3-AM fluorescence and the red ones represented the lysosomes stained by LysoTracker Red in the PC12 cells, and the blue ones indicated the nuclei stained by DAPI (Figure 5(a)). It was evident that the coincubation of Aβ1-42 with the differentiated PC12 cells enhanced the calcium influx, and the mean relative fluorescent intensity (MRFI) of Fluo-3-AM fluorescence in the cells was approximately 3.6-fold higher than that in normal PC12cells (18.6 ± 3.68 for cells treated with Aβ1-42 only vs. 5.17 ± 1.24 for normal cells) as shown in Figure 5(b). The increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels was remarkably inhibited by the treatment of TP or MC-PLGA-TP-NP (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). Furthermore, MC-PLGA-TP-NP exhibited the better inhibition effect on calcium influx (8.25 ± 2.04 vs. 12.62 ± 2.56 for TP, p < 0.05). In comparison of other groups, the strongest red fluorescence was observed, corresponding to the endocytosis of MC-PLGA-TP-NP into the cells. Colocalization of both the red and the green stains showing orange-yellow color indicated that plenty of MC-PLGA-TP-NP was transported into lysosome where lysosomal acidification drove Ca2+ influx. In combination, the obtained data suggested that MC-PLGA-TP-NP may exert a better neuroprotective activity in the AD cellular model via following pharmacological mechanisms at least inhibiting cytotoxicity and increasing the intracellular Ca2+ influx induced by Aβ, attenuating the oxidative stress in cells. However, whether MC-PLGA-TP-NP has an obvious therapeutic effect on AD models in vivo has not been studied. We are aware that our claims would require confirmation after in vivo animal tests, including biodistribution and therapy efficiency of MC-PLGA-TP-NP on the transgenic animal model of AD.\", \\'ref_79:Compound (4) was revealed to have the molecular formula C20H28O3, by HR-ESIMS (m/z 316.9894) with 7 degree of unsaturation. The UV absorption at 320 and 282 nm indicated the presence of the benzene ring. In the IR spectrum, a hydroxyl group absorption was observed at 3400 cm−1 and absorptions at 1600 and 1510 cm−1 for the aromatic ring. Twenty carbon signals were observed in the 13C-NMR and DEPT-experiment, six of them appeared in the aromatic area and indicated the presence of three double bonds at δ 143.5, 142.0, 134.7, 133.9, 129.6 and 112.9 assigned for carbons 12, 11, 8, 13, 9 and 14 respectively (Table 1). A singlet aromatic proton at δH 6.60 in 1H-NMR spectrum postulates the presence of a penta-substituted aromatic ring. In addition, it showed the presence of one hydroxymethylene group at δH 4.31 and 3.01 (2H, d, J = 8.5 Hz), downfield oxymethine at δH 4.67 (br t, J = 3.9 Hz) assigned for H7. The presence of an isopropyl group linked to a quaternary carbon was supported by the signals at δH 3.25 (1H, m, H15), 1.20 (3H, br d, J = 6.0 Hz, CH3-16) and 1.21 (3H, br d, J = 6.0 Hz, CH3-17). Besides the isopropyl group, the presence of two tertiary methyl groups at δH 0.87 (3H, s) and 1.15 (3H, s) in the 1H-NMR and 20 carbon signal in the 13C-NMR spectra (Table 1) revealed an abietane diterpenoid structure. The absence of a tertiary methyl group (C20) at C10 frequently present in abietane-type diterpene and the presence of germinal hydroxymethelene protons at δH 4.31 and 3.01 (2H, d, J = 8.5 Hz) suggests that methyl group 20 was replaced by hydroxymethylene. The measurement of long range HMBC experiment was useful in determining the final structure where two and three bond correlations were observed from the methylene protons (H2O) (δH 4.31, 3.01) to C5, C7, C9 and C10, from H14 at δH 6.60 and the carbons at δC 72.7 (C7) and δC 129.6 (C9); and between the proton resonance at δH 4.67 (H7) and the carbons at δC 44.6 (C5) and δC 129.6 (C9). The above findings confirmed that Compound (4) is an abietane-type diterpene with an ether linkage between C20 and C7. The presence of such a type of ether linkage is uncommon in the plants belonging to family Lamiaceae. Comparing the above mentioned NMR data, MS and other spectral finding with those reported for 20-deoxocarnosol proved that both compounds were identical.The other three known diterpenes (1) (dehydroabietane), (2) (5,6-didehydro-7-hydroxy-taxodone) and (3) (taxodione) were previously isolated from other plant species particularly from Salvia and Taxodium species. The chemical structures were determined by comparison of NMR spectral data with published data.\\', \\'ref_80:Notably, a CRE-luciferase reporter assay using hTGR5 and mTGR5 clearly showed that hTGR5 shows a higher response to nomilin than does mTGR5 (Fig 1B). On the basis of this finding, we generated several types of expression plasmids for mouse–human chimeric TGR5 and revealed the important region for hTGR5–nomilin interaction (Fig 2A–2D). In addition, using mouse-to-human point-mutated TGR5, three amino acid residues (Q77ECL1, R80ECL1, and Y893.29 in hTGR5) were identified as key residues for nomilin response (Fig 3A and 3B). In general, class A GPCRs, including TGR5, show a consensus ligand-binding pocket, and TM3 is the hub for this structure. This supports our finding that hTGR5 Y893.29 is one of the critical residues involved in the hTGR5–nomilin interaction. Another report showed that positively charged residues in ECL1 could play an important role in agonist binding, which is consistent with the fact that hTGR5 R80ECL1 contributes to nomilin binding. Furthermore, hTGR5-WT and mTGR5-R76QECL1/Q79RECL1/H88Y3.29 showed EC50 values similar to those of nomilin, whereas those of mTGR5-WT and hTGR5-Q77RECL1/R80QECL1/Y89H3.29 were lower (Fig 4B). Changes in the EC50 values of TLCA due to these triple mutations were relatively lower than those in the EC50 values of nomilin. These results confirmed that Q77ECL1, R80ECL1, and Y893.29 are crucial for the hTGR5–nomilin interaction and that this binding pattern is different from that for TLCA (Fig 4B).Based on these results, the hTGR5–nomilin docking model was constructed (Fig 5A). Because nomilin is a TGR5 agonist, we selected metarhodopsin II, an active form of rhodopsin, as a template. The docking simulation showed that hTGR5 Q77ECL1, R80ECL1, and Y893.29 form four hydrophilic hydrogen-bonding interactions with four oxygen atoms in nomilin (Fig 5B). Obacunone, a limonoid sharing three oxygen atoms with nomilin, which leads to hydrophilic hydrogen-bonding interactions with Q77ECL1, R80ECL1, and Y893.29 (Fig 6A), also exhibited higher agonist activity for hTGR5 than for mTGR5 (Fig 6D). In addition, our triple mutation study showed that Q77ECL1, R80ECL1, and Y893.29 were crucial for hTGR5–obacunone interaction, akin to nomilin (Fig 6E and 6F). The docking simulation also indicated that limonin could not activate hTGR5 in a manner identical to nomilin or obacunone due to the steric repulsion caused by a 6-membered ring lactone and furan ring (S3A Fig). These results support the relevance of hTGR5–nomilin binding modes as determined using in silico docking simulation.A previous report showed that TLCA forms a salt bridge and two hydrogen bonds with R79EL1, E1695.44, and Y2406.51, suggesting that TLCA bind to the wider space in the hTGR5 ligand binding pocket than nomilin. Higher efficacies of TLCA relative to nomilin might be partially explained by the difference of these binding positions. In conclusion, we identified the key amino acid residues and molecular features of the hTGR5–nomilin interaction. The binding mode of hTGR5–nomilin is vastly different from that of other TGR5 agonists, such as TLCA and INT-777, suggesting that TGR5 forms various binding patterns depending on the agonist type. Our study promotes a better understanding of the structure of TGR5, and it may help in the future development and screening of new TGR5 agonists.\\', \\'ref_81:Compound 1, isolated as a colorless oil, displayed an ion peak at m/z 288.2459 (HRFABMS), corresponding to C20H32O and consistent with [M]+. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) included signals for four singlet methyls (δH 0.86, 1.13, 1.23, and 1.64), one exomethylene group (δH 4.65 and 4.74), and an oxygenated methine (δH 3.72). The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) revealed 20 carbon signals, which corresponded to four quaternary carbon atoms, four methines, eight methylenes, and four methyls, as determined from DEPT experiments. Among them, two olefinic (δC 112.8 and 147.4) and two oxygenated (δC 84.6 and 85.5) carbons were evident. Since the carbon-carbon double bond accounted for one of the five degrees of unsaturation, the molecular structure of 1 was determined as tetracyclic. Due to the presence of two oxygenated carbons but only one oxygen atom in the molecule, in combination with the absence of an absorption band at either 1670–1750 or 3300–3500 cm−1 in the IR spectrum, the oxygen atom was assigned to an ether function. Comparison of these spectroscopic characteristics to those previously reported for dolastane diterpenes and analysis of the correlations observed in the HMBC and COSY spectra (Figure 2) pointed to a 17-dolastene skeleton. In particular, the presence of the isopropenyl group was indicated by the long-range coupling between H2-18 and H3-19 and the HMBC correlations of C-9 and C-17 with H2-18 and H3-19, whereas the cross-peaks of H-8/H-9, H-9/H2-10 and H2-10/H2-11, in conjunction with the HMBC correlations of C-8, C-11 and C-12 with H3-16 confirmed the assignment of the five-membered ring and placed the first aliphatic methyl on C-12. The COSY correlations of H2-6/H2-7, H2-7/H-8 and H2-13/H-14, as well as the HMBC correlations of C-5 and C-6 with H-14 and H3-20 and of C-13 with H3-16 defined the seven-membered ring and fixed the position of the second aliphatic methyl on C-5. Furthermore, the HMBC correlations of C-1 and C-2 with H3-15, of C-4 with H3-20 and of C-14 with H-4 and H3-15, in combination with the cross-peaks of H-2/H2-3 and H-3β/H-4 concluded the assignment of the six-membered ring and placed the third aliphatic methyl on C-1. Finally, the correlation of C-1 with H-4 observed in the HMBC spectrum indicated that the ether bridge was positioned between carbons C-1 and C-4. The relative configurations of the stereocenters of metabolite 1 were established by analysis of the key correlations displayed in the NOESY spectrum (Figure 3). The NOE enhancements of H-8/H-9, H-8/H3-20, and H-14/H3-16 provided evidence that H-14 and H3-16 were cofacial, whereas H-8, H-9, and H3-20 were on the opposite side of the molecule, thus suggesting the trans fusion of the six- and seven-membered rings, as well as of the seven- and five-membered rings and determining the relative configurations of the chiral centers C-5, C-8, C-9, C-12, and C-14 as 5S*,8S*,9S*,12R*,14S*, in accordance with previously reported dolastane derivatives isolated from the same algal specimens. Taking into account that the ether bridge formation between C-1 and C-4 required the cis orientation of the substituents at the α and α′ positions to the ether linkage, namely H-4 and H3-15, in conjunction with the interactions of H-4 with Η2-3, Η2-6, and Η3-20, as well as of Η-3α with Η-6α observed in the NOESY spectrum, the relative configurations at C-1 and C-4 were determined as 1R*,4S*. The absence of a COSY correlation between H-3α and H-4, indicating that the dihedral angle Η-3α–C-3–C-4–H-4 was approaching 90°, further supported the proposed conformation.Compound 2, obtained as a yellow oil, had the molecular formula C20H32O3, as calculated from the HRFABMS measurements and NMR data. The spectroscopic characteristics of 2 were rather similar to those of metabolite 1. Specifically, the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1), as in the case of 1, included signals for four singlet methyls (δH 0.88, 1.03, 1.07, and 1.78), one exomethylene group (δH 4.68 and 4.96), and an oxygenated methine (δH 3.19). The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) revealed 20 carbon signals, among which one carbonyl (δC 224.3), two olefinic (δC 113.3 and 147.0), and two oxygenated (δC 72.3 and 78.2) carbons were evident. The absorption bands at 1728 and 3430 cm−1 observed in the IR spectrum, in conjunction with the molecular formula indicated the presence of a ketone moiety and two hydroxy groups in the molecule. The HMBC correlations of C-11 with H-8, H-9, H2-10, and H3-16 fixed the position of the ketone functionality, whereas the correlations of C-1 with H2-2, H-14, and H3-15 and C-4 with H2-3 and H3-20 placed the two hydroxy groups at C-1 and C-4. The relative configurations of the chiral centers of 2 were determined on the basis of the key correlations observed in the NOESY spectrum. In particular, the NOE interactions of H-8/H-9, H-8/H3-20, and H-14/H3-16 suggested the same relative configurations at C-5, C-8, C-9, C-12, and C-14 as in the case of 1, while the cross peaks of H-4/H-14 and H3-15/H3-20 established the relative configurations at C-1 and C-4 as 1S*,4S*. Compound 3 was isolated as a colorless oil. The structural elements displayed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 3 closely resembled those of metabolite 2. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) included signals for two aliphatic and two vinylic singlet methyls (δH 0.84, 1.07, 1.63, and 1.82), one exomethylene group (δH 4.71 and 4.99), an olefinic methine (δH 5.32), and an oxygenated proton (δH 3.42), whereas the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) revealed 20 carbon signals, among which a carbonyl (δC 224.1), one oxygenated (δC 74.9), and four olefinic (δC 113.4, 120.4, 135.6, and 147.2) carbons were apparent. In agreement with the molecular formula C20H30O2, as deduced from the HRFABMS data, it was obvious that the difference between 2 and 3 was the absence of one hydroxy group and the formation of a second carbon-carbon double bond. The trisubstituted double bond was placed between C-1 and C-2 as indicated by the HMBC correlations of both C-4 and C-15 with H-2. The relative configurations of the stereogenic centers of 3 were established by analysis of the key NOE enhancements observed, in accordance with those of 2, as 4S*,5S*,8S*,9S*,12R*,14R*.Reduction of metabolite 2 according to Molander et al. yielded the 11-deoxo derivative of 2, identical in all respects to (1S,4S,8S,14S)-1,4-dihydroxy-17-dolastene. Since the semisynthetic compound exhibited the same sign of optical rotation as the natural product previously isolated from the same algal collection, for which the absolute configuration was determined by application of Mosher’s method, the absolute configuration of 2 was established as depicted. The absolute configurations of metabolites 1 and 3 were not determined due to the limited available amounts, but on the basis of biogenetic considerations they are expected to be the same. Among the new dolastanes isolated in the present study, metabolite 2, which was obtained in adequate quantity, was evaluated for its cytotoxic activity against four human apoptosis-resistant (U373, A549, SKMEL28, OE21) and two human apoptosis-sensitive (PC3, LoVo) cancer cell lines, since previously isolated dolastanes had shown moderate cytotoxicity. Furthermore, compound 2 was tested for its inhibitory effect on the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). However, in both cases metabolite 2 exhibited no activity.\\', \\'ref_82:As shown in Scheme 1, TP-CSO was prepared by a coupling reaction between TPS and CSO, and TP could be released via hydrolysis. The structure information of TP, CSO, TP+CSO (physical mixture) and TP-CSO was shown in Figure 1 (1H NMR see Supplementary Materials, Figure S1). TP shows a strong absorption band at 1748.56 cm−1 that was associated with the C=O stretching of cyclic ester groups. The characteristic peaks of the CSO at 3399.62 cm−1 was due to the stretching vibration of NH2 and OH groups. Moreover, the 1617.48 cm−1 absorption band was corresponded to the N-H deformation of amino groups. The FTIR spectra of TP-CSO showed a new absorption peak at the wavenumbers of 1643.05 cm−1, which is attributed to the C=O stretching vibration of the amide group, while the absorption band at the wavenumber of 1617.48 cm−1 (corresponding to the NH2 group of CSO) mostly disappeared in the FTIR spectrum of TP-CSO, which indicated that the amide group was successfully introduced (Figure 1A).The thermal behaviors of TP, CSO, TP-CSO and physical mixture (TP+CSO) were investigated using DSC under a nitrogen atmosphere (Figure 1B). The exothermic peaks of the CSO and physical mixture (containing 4 wt% of TP and 96 wt% of CSO) were in the range of 67–71 °C. However, the free TP showed a sharp exothermic peak at 213.1 °C and a broad endothermic peak at 239.6 °C, respectively. The TP-CSO conjugate displayed a broad endothermic peak at 227.04 °C with an onset at 209.03 °C (Figure 1C). Thus, the endotherm of TP-CSO reflected the physical and chemical structure changes during the introduction of the TP moiety into the CSO backbone. In addition, the physical mixture and CSO had the enthalpy (∆H) of -188.41 J/g, whereas TP-CSO had ∆H of 73.56 J/g (Figure 1C). This result could be explained by the fact that increasing acylation caused an increase in enthalpy, which was consistent with the previous report. The XRD patterns of TP, CSO, TP-CSO and the physical mixture (TP+CSO) were depicted in Figure 1D. TP showed many small XRD peaks between the 2theta range of 9.54–28.69°, whereas CSO exhibited two continuous peaks at 21.47° and 24.56°. Compared with TP and CSO, the physical mixture (containing 4 wt% of TP and 96 wt% of CSO) displayed the multiple XRD peaks from the overlap between TP and CSO. Therefore, the broad single XRD patterns of the TP-CSO reflected the decrease in crystallinity of the TP-CSO backbone, which could be attributed to the presence of TP moiety. The XRD patterns revealed that TP-CSO were amorphous compared to TP and CSO. Furthermore, the result indicated that the TP moiety was successfully introduced into the CSO backbone.The weight percentage of TP in TP-CSO was measured at approximately 4 wt% by using the HPLC method (for HPLC spectra see Supplementary Materials, Figures S2 and S3). The TP-CSO conjugate, a yellowish solid, has over a 35-fold greater water solubility (15 mg TP-CSO/mL) than TP (0.017 mg/mL). The above results showed that the TP-CSO conjugate had been successfully synthesized through the coupling of TP and CSO, which significantly improved the water solubility of TP.The in vivo toxicity of TP and TP-CSO was evaluated in healthy C57 mice (Figure 4A). According to our preliminary experiments, the minimum dose of TP causing the death of mice was about 0.6 mg/kg. There was no significant difference in body weight between the low- and medium-dose TP-CSO groups and the control group (p < 0.05), while the TP group and the high-dose TP-CSO group showed obvious body weight loss but without lethality at the end of the experiment, indicating that TP-CSO protected mice from weight loss or death caused by TP-induced toxicity.Different degrees of liver and kidney injury are indicated by the changes in serum ALT, AST, BUN and CRE levels. The ALT and AST levels in the TP group and the high-dose TP-CSO group were obviously higher than those in other groups, which indicated the two groups occurred liver injury (p < 0.05, Figure 4B). However, the low- and medium-dose of TP-CSO groups showed moderate effects on ALT and AST in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05), which were still safe for the liver. In the TP group and high-dose TP-CSO group, BUN and CRE levels were significantly lower than in the control group (Figure 4B). The low-dose TP-CSO group had a slight effect on BUN and CRE, whereas the medium-dose TP-CSO group showed higher BUN and CRE levels in comparison to the TP group. The study results showed that in vivo toxicity of TP is related to hepatic and renal injury in a dose-dependent manner. As compared with the TP group, the medium-dose TP-CSO group underwent mild changes in AST, ALT, BUN and CRE levels, indicating that TP-CSO may relieve the TP-induced toxicity in liver and kidney.The in vivo antitumor efficacy of TP-CSO was assessed by monitoring changes of tumor volume in the Panco2-bearing mice (Figure 5). The tumor volume gradually increased in all treatment groups for the first seven to nine days, followed by a decrease in tumor volume (Figure 5A). Compared to the control group, the tumor in all treated groups was significantly diminished in the dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05), especially in the high-dose TP-CSO group (Figure 5B). By the end of the study, the tumor-inhibition rate (TIR) was 43.39% in the TP group, 42.18%, 59.23%, and 90.29% in the low-, medium-, and high-dose TP-CSO groups, respectively. At the same dose of TP, TP-CSO had a stronger tumor inhibition effect than the free TP, indicating that much more TP-CSO conjugate were actively or passively accumulated in the tumor cells, followed by TP release from the conjugate via cleavage of the succinate linker between TP and CSO.In general, body weight in treated groups changes due to a combination of tumor development and drug toxicity. The control group displayed a gradual increase in body weight over 13 days, which showed that the tumor development didn’t primarily cause mainly weight loss (Figure 5C). There was no significant difference between the TP-CSO groups (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) and the control group (p < 0.05), whereas the TP group (0.4 mg/kg) and the TP-CSO group (0.6 mg/kg) showed an obvious decrease in body weight, indicating the result of the dual effects of both the TP toxicity and its dose dependency. The results suggested that TP-CSO had a better anti-tumor effect and lower in vivo toxicity than TP. We hypothesized that the controlled release of TP-CSO would reduce the instantaneous TP concentration in the blood and prolong the TP circulation time in the blood, which could improve its biological safety and antitumor activity.As shown in Figure 5D, the control group showed the obvious nuclear division, and negligible apoptosis levels were observed in the dense tumor cells, whereas the treated groups exhibited a large number of cell necrosis and apoptosis in the tumor tissues, indicating TP and TP-CSO have a significant inhibitory effect on tumor cells. In particular, the medium- and high-dose TP-CSO groups displayed a higher apoptosis rate and cell necrosis than the TP group, indicating that TP-CSO has better anti-tumor activity than TP. Analysis of histological staining revealed the obvious kidney proximal tubular dilation and fatty degeneration in the hepatocytes in the TP group (Figure 5D). However, no significant histopathological changes were observed in the TP-CSO groups, which was consistent with the in vivo toxicity results of TP-CSO.\\', \"ref_83:**homology modeling and ligand docking** The homology modeling of TPS18 was done in SWISS-MODEL online software (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/). The homology model of TPS18 [using 5-*epi*-aristolochene synthase from *Nicotiana tabacum* with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) number of 5EAT as the template] was downloaded from the PDB. And the reliability of the modeled enzyme structure was evaluated in Structure Validation Server SAVESv6.0 (https://saves.mbi.ucla.edu/). Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), the substrate of TPS18, was downloaded from the PubChem database. Then, FPP was docked into the corresponding pocket of TPS18 by Auto Dock Tools-1.5.6. PyMOL was used for the visual analysis of tertiary structural changes, simulation of single amino acid site mutations, and derivation and assessment of mutated protein variant conformations. The thermal stability of docked TPS18 and FPP was also evaluated by PyMOL using the B-factor. The Prime MM-GBSA module of Schrödinger software (Maestro 12.8) was used to calculate the binding free energy between each TPS18 protein variant and the ligand molecule. **mutagenesis analysis** The TPS18-containing plasmid pZK08 was used as the template for the amplification of mutated TPS18 variants using site-directed mutagenesis. The amplified plasmid was digested by the restriction enzyme Dpn I. The digested mixture was then transformed into competent *Escherichia coli* cells. Plasmids from the positive colonies were extracted and sequenced. The primers used in this section are listed in Table S3. **statistical analysis** GraphPad Prism 8 software was used for data processing and statistical analyses. Unpaired two-tailed Student\\'s *t*-tests were performed to assess significant differences, with a *P*-value <0.05 considered statistically significant. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation.Triterpenoid ergosterol is an important and specific constituent of the fungal plasma membrane [61], and it is essential for yeast growth and development. Although metabolic flux was redirected to the production of sesquiterpenoid 5-epi-jinkoheremol in the engineered yeast of this work, it would not impede the normal growth of yeast. In the constructed yeast strain, the ergosterol biosynthesis, initiated from squalene (encoded by the squalene synthase Erg9), was weakened by replacing the native promoter of ERG9 with glucose-induced promoter HXT1p to guide more metabolic flux to the biosynthesis of sesquiterpene, but the biosynthesis of squalene and its subsequent product ergosterol was not blocked. From the measured cell biomass in Table S4, it was found that the contents of squalene and ergosterol were enough for the normal growth of engineered yeast.\", \\'ref_84:Compound 1 (Figure 2) was isolated and purified as amorphous solid. The HRESIMS (high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) gave the molecular formula C27H40O6, which established from the positive pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 461.2901 [M + H]+. The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 (Table 1) exhibited six methyl groups as singlets at [δH 0.80 (3H), 0.84 (6H), 0.89 (3H), 1.23 (3H), and 2.09 (3H)]. Additionally, the 1H NMR spectrum revealed three protons in the vicinity of the oxygen-bearing substituents δH 6.17 (s), 5.67 (dd, J = 9.6, 7.2 Hz) and 3.82 (dd, J = 16.8, 6.6 Hz) (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1). The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited signals for 27 carbons including six methyls, seven methylenes, six methines and eight quaternary carbons (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2). The 1H-1H-COSY (correlation spectroscopy) (Figure 3) and the HSQC (heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy) NMR data analysis indicate the following partial fragments: C-1 to C-3; C-5 to C-7; C-9 to C-12; and C-14 to C-16. In addition, the correlations of H-12 (δH 3.82) with the acetyl carbon at δC 169.8 and H-16 with neighboring carbons in the HMBC (heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectroscopy) (Supplementary Materials, Figures S3–S5) allowed identification of a 12-acetoxy-16-hydroxyscalarane framework (Figure 3). The 1H and 13C spectral data were compatible to a large degree with those of the known scalarane sesterterpenoid hyrtiolide, with the exception of an additional acetyl group δH 2.09 (3H, s); δC 21.02 (CH3), 169.8 (qC) present in compound 1. The C-17/C-18 double bond was inferred by long range correlations between H3-25 at δH 1.23 and the quaternary olefinic carbon at δC 168.7 (C-18) and between H-16 at δH 5.67 and the olefinic carbon at δC 126.1 (C-17). Furthermore, the 13C chemical shifts of C-17 and C-18 indicated the location of the carbonyl at C-20.The relative configuration of H-12, H-16 and H-19 was detected by their coupling constants and confirmed by interpreting the NOESY spectrum (nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy) (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). The α-configuration of H-12 was deduced on the basis of the diaxial coupling of H-12 (δH 3.82; dd, J = 16.8 and 6.6 Hz) with H-11 and cross-peaks with α oriented H-9 and H-14 in NOESY (Figure 4). Similarly, the diaxial coupling of H-16 (δH 5.67; dd, J = 9.6 and 7.2 Hz) with H-15 indicates its α-configuration which was confirmed by cross-peaks with α oriented H-14 in NOESY (Figure 4). Finally, the β-configuration of H-19 was indicated by NOESY cross-peak between H-19 (δH 6.17) and Me-25 (δH 1.23). Thus, compound 1 was identified as 12-acetoxy,16-epi-hyrtiolide (Figure 4).Compound 2 (Figure 2) was purified as amorphous solid. The molecular formula C28H42O6 was deduced from HRESIMS as well as from 13C NMR data. The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 2 (Table 2) included seven singlets, two of them at δH 2.13 (3H) and 3.47 (3H) were assigned as an acetoxy and methoxy groups, respectively. While the other remaining singlets at δH 0.80 (3H), 0.82 (3H), 0.84 (3H), 0.92 (3H) and 1.26 (3H) were belonging to the five methyl groups of a scalarane framework sesterterpene.Additionally, the specrum displayed resonances for 21 protons including, seven methylenes, six aliphatic methines and exchangeable broad signal at δH 4.25 for OH moiety (Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) displayed signals at δC 167.8 (C-19), 159.4 (C-17), 138.3 (C-18) and 94.2 (CH-20), which is characteristic for furan-derived, α,β-unsaturated-γ-hydroxybutyrolactone that is frequently present at scalarane sesterterpenes terminus. In addition, the remaining signals in 13C NMR spectrum represent signals for 24 carbons including seven methyls, seven methylenes, five methines, and five quaternary carbons (Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). In HMBC data (Figure 3), the long-range correlations between the H-16 (δH 4.08) and the carbon atoms (δC 159.4, C-17); (δC 138.3, C-18) and (δC 57.5, C-28) determined the position of methoxy group at C-16 (Supplementary Materials, Figures S9 and S10). The location of C-17 and C-18 was confirmed by HMBC correlation between H-12 and C-18. Furthermore, the 13C chemical shifts of C-17 and C-18 confirmed the location of the carbonyl group at C-19. Therefore, the structure of compound 2 was elucidated as a 12-acetoxy-16-methoxyscalarane framework (Figure 3) based on the correlations of H-12 and H-16 with neighboring protons and carbons in the COSY (Supplementary Materials, Figure S11) and HMBC.Relative configuration at C-12, C-16 and C-20 was detected and confirmed based on their coupling constants and NOESY correlations (Supplementary Materials, Figure S12). On the basis of the coupling constants, the diaxial coupling of H-12 (δH 4.88; dd, J = 10.8 and 3.6 Hz) with H-11 and NOESY cross-peaks with α oriented H-9 and H-14 indicate its α-configuration (Figure 5).Similarly, the diaxial coupling of H-16 (δH 4.08; dd, J = 9.0 and 6.6 Hz) with H-15 indicates the α-configuration of H-16 which was confirmed by NOESY cross-peaks with the α oriented H-14 (Figure 5). Finally, cross-peaks between H-20 and β-OMe in NOESY indicate its β-configuration (Figure 5).Annexin V-FITC/PI staining coupled with flowcytometry was used to assess proportion of cells undergoing necrosis or cells undergoing programmed cell death (apoptosis). HCT-116 was treated with 5 µM of compounds 3, 5 and 9 for only 24 h and apoptosis/necrosis cell death was assessed. Compound 5 significantly increased total cell death by 20 fold compared to control. Cell death induced by compound 5 is attributed mainly to apoptosis induction; and a much lesser extent is attributed to necrosis (Figure 6A,C,E). Compound 9 significantly induced total cell death by 1.2 fold compared to control cells. Similarly, compound 9 mainly induced cell killing effect via the activation of programmed cell death rather than non-specific necrosis cell death (Figure 6A,D,E). Compound 3 was the weakest among the other selected compounds; it only induced more apoptosis with reciprocal less necrosis compared to control cells. However, total cell death induced by compound 3 was not significant from control untreated cells (Figure 6A,B,E).After exposure of HCT-116 cells to the pre-determined IC50’s of selected compounds, trypan blue exclusion assay was used to confirm percent of cells with lost membrane integrity (necrosis and late apoptosis populations). After cell exposure for 72 h, compound 3 and compound 9 induced moderate membrane integrity damage indicated by 5.1% ± 1.3% and 9.5% ± 2.1% positive trypan blue cells, respectively. On the other hand, compound 5 induced profound membrane integrity damage with 67.6% ± 4.2% trypan blue positive cells (Supplementary Table S1).Figure 6 Effect of potentially active compounds on cell death profile against HCT-116 cells.Cell cycle distribution using DNA flow cytometry was used to investigate the influence of compounds 3, 5 and 9 on the proliferation profile of tumor cells. Cells were exposed to compounds 3, 5 and 9 (1 µM) for 24 h and cell cycle phases were assessed as mentioned in the experimental section. All tested compounds (3, 5 and 9) exerted significant anti-proliferative effect against HCT-116 cells appeared as increased cell population in G0/G1-phase from 53% ± 1.0% to 59.8% ± 0.2%, 68.4% ± 1.7% and 71.5% ± 0.5% respectively. The increased non proliferating cell population in compounds 3, 5 and 9 was accompanied by reciprocal decrease in cells in S-phase from 35.4% ± 1.7% to 31.8% ± 0.2%, 21.8% ± 1.2% and 18.7% ± 1.1% respectively. Additionally, only compound 3 treatment resulted in decreasing G2/M cells from 11.6% ± 0.9% to 8.4% ± 0.1% after 24 h (Figure 7A–E). In addition, compounds 5 and 9 significantly increased cells in Pre-G phase (apoptotic cells) from 1.0% ± 0.1% to 65.1% ± 1.0% and 4.8% ± 0.1% respectively (Figure 7F). It can be concluded that the potential anticancer activity of compound 3 might be solely attributed to antiproliferative effect while compounds 5 and 9 possess mixed cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities. Further molecular studies on compounds 5 and 9 to assess their modes of action are highly recommended. Due to the low yield of compounds from marine origin on the top of their non-renewability, it might be difficult to harvest sufficient material for use in a clinical setting. However, synthetic chemists are highly urged to use this nucleus as a lead compound in the field of anti-cancer drug discovery.Figure 7 presents the effects of potentially active compounds on cell cycle distribution of HCT-116 cells.\\', \\'ref_85:Tripordolide A (1) was obtained as a colorless needle, and gave a positive reaction in the kedde reagent test on the TLC, which suggested the structure of compound 1 contained the lactone ring. Its molecular formula of C20H26O7 was determined on the basis of HRESIMS at m/z 379.17532 [M + H]+ (calculated for C20H27O7: 379.17513), indicating eight degrees of unsaturation. The 1H NMR spectrum data of 1 (Table 1) exhibited signals of three methyl groups [δH 1.12 (6H, s, H3-16 and H3-17)], two aromatic methines [δH 6.10 (1H, d, overlap) and 6.12 (1H, d, overlap)], an oxygenated methylene [δH 4.77(2H, m)], and two oxygenated methines [δH 3.96(1H, d, J = 2.8 Hz, H-7; 3.99 (1H, d, J = 6.0 Hz)]. The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra demonstrated 20 carbons resonances, which contained a carbonyl, seven oxygenated carbons (four quaternary carbons, a methylene, and two methines), two aromatic quaternary carbons, and two aromatic methenes. According to this information, the skeleton of 1 was recognized to be an 18(4→3)-abeo-abietane, which contained five rings and four hydroxy groups to be satisfied with its indices of hydrogen deficiency. Its planar structure and 1H, 13C NMR assignments could be confirmed with an analysis of the two-dimensional NMR (Figure 2). A ring of α, β-unsaturated-γ-lactone was confirmed based on the HMBC correlation from H2-19 [δH 4.77 (2H, m)] to C-18(δC 173.5) and C-3(δC 122.8). Structure of rings A and B could be determined by the 1H, 1H COSY correlations of H-1/H-2 and H-5/H-6/H-7, and the HMBC correlation of H3-20 [δH 1.00 (3H, s)]/C-1 (δC 27.5), C-5 (δC 35.1), C-9 (δC 76.0), and C-10 (δC 40.2). The HMBC Correlations from H-12 to C-9, C-13 (δC 82.7), C-14 (δC 77.6), and C-15 (δC 70.5); from H-14 [δH 3.99 (1H, d, J = 6.0 Hz)] to C-8 (δC 75.9) and C-13 corroborated the ring C. The four hydroxy groups were assigned to C-8, C-9, C-14, and C-15, indicated by the HMBC correlations of 8-OH [δH 4.86 (1H, s)]/C-7 (δC 74.3) and C-8, 9-OH [δH 4.03 (1H, s)]/C-10, C-11 (δC 134.0), and C-12 (δC 131.1), 15-OH [δH 4.15 (1H, s)]/C-13, C-15, C-16 (δC 24.3), and C-17 (δC 27.4); the 1H, 1H COSY correlation from H-14 to 14-OH [δH 4.90 (1H, d, J = 6.0 Hz)]. Finally, the fifth ring was an oxide bridge between C-7 and C-13 (furan ring) to meet with the HRESIMS data.NOESY analysis was used to deduce the relative configuration of 1 (Figure 3). Orientations were confirmed by the NOE correlations of H3-20/8-OH, 9-OH and H-6β; of H-6β /H-7/H-14. Finally, the proposed structure of 1 was confirmed by an X-ray crystallography analysis using anomalous scattering of Cu Kα radiation (Figure 4). Accordingly, the absolute configuration of 5S, 7R, 8S, 9R, 10S, 13S, and 14S was established based on the value of the Flack absolute structure parameter—0.02(11).Tripordolide B (2) was obtained as a colorless oil and showed a [M + Na]+ ion peak at m/z 399.1052 (calculated for 399.1050) in the HRESIMS, which corresponded to the molecular formula C19H20O8. Some obvious signals, a ring of α, β-unsaturated-γ-lactone [δH 5.42 (2H, m, H-17); δC 170.4 (C-18), 68.9 (C-19), 124.4 (C-3), and 146.5 (C-4)] and an oxygen isopropyl group [δH 1.23, 1.41 (each 3H, s, H3-16 and H3-17); δC 25.2(C-16), 26.8 (C-17), and 73.6 (C-15)], indicated 2 was also an 18(4→3)-abeo-abietane derivative (Table 1) and similar to a less 20-CH3 and aromatized nor-abietane, tripterlide F., This was proven by the HMBC correlations of H-1 [δH 7.22 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz)]/C-4, C-5 (δC 128.7) and C-9 (δC 60.7); of H-2 [δH 7.70 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz)]/C-4, C-10 (δC 138.5) and C-18 (Figure 2). Some major differences between the two compounds in the chemical shift values of C-12 and C-13 were observed, which could be attributed to the breakage of a trisubstituted epoxide between C-12 (δC 69.7) and C-13 (δC 74.9). Furthermore, compared to the tripterlide F, the oxygen isopropyl group of 2 also lead to the lower field of C-15 (δC 73.6), C-16 (δC 25.2), and C-17 (δC 26.8). The relative configuration was established by the NOESY correlations of H-12/H-1 and of H-7/H-14/H-12 (Figure 5). Thus, 2 was elucidated as shown, named tripordolide B.Tripordolide C (3) was obtained as a colorless oil and had the molecular formula C20H26O7, deduced from the [M + Na]+ ion peak at m/z 401.1574 (calculated 401.1571). Its 1H and 13C NMR characteristics (Table 1) could be concluded; 3 was also an 18(4→3)-abeo-abietane derivative. Its planar structure has been confirmed by an analysis of a two-dimensional NMR (Figure 2). HMBC correlation of 15-OH [δH 4.17 (1H, s)]/C-15 (δC 69.6), C-16 (δC 27.4), and C-17 (δC 26.1); 1H, 1H COSY correlations of 7-OH [δH 5.34 (1H, d, J = 5.4 Hz)]/H-7 [δH 4.22 (1H, m)], 11-OH [δH 5.02 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz)]/H-11[δH 4.45 (1H, br d, J = 8.0 Hz)], and 14-OH [δH 4.86 (1H, d, J = 4.4 Hz)]/H-14 [δH 4.47 (1H, d, J = 4.4 Hz)] suggested that the four hydroxy groups were located at C-7, C-11, C-14, and C-15. HMBC correlations from H3-20 [δH 1.05 (1H, s)] to C-5 (δC 40.8), C-10 (δC 35.6), and C-11 (δC 62.0), and from H-14 [δH 4.47 (1H, d, J = 4.4 Hz)] to C-8 (δC 131.7), C-9 (δC 137.8), C-12 (δC 55.9), and C-13 (δC 61.9) indicated a double bond between C-8 and C-9. Moreover, a trisubstituted epoxide between C-12 and C-13 was formed to meet with its indices of hydrogen deficiency, which also led the chemical shift of C-12 (δC 55.9) and C-13 (δC 61.9) to upfield. The relative configuration was established by the NOESY correlations of H-12/H-11/H-20 and of H-6β/H-7/H-14-OH (Figure 5). Therefore, 3 was elucidated as shown, named tripordolide C.\\', \"ref_86:The previous study has shown that OILTS produces (+)-germacrene D–4–ol (2) from (2E, 6E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP, 1), when Mg2+ ion is used as a cofactor. We examined the enzyme reactions with 0.5 mM of various other metal ions: Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Sr2+. With substrate 1, the metal ions except Cu2+ and Sr2+ acted as cofactors (Figure 2a and Figure S1). Notably, in the presence of Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+, OILTS yielded a new enzyme product (3) as a minor product (Figure 2a). The concentration of each metal ion was optimized and it was revealed that 5 mM Mg2+, 0.05 mM Mn2+, 0.05 mM Co2+, 0.5 mM Ni2+, and 0.1 mM Zn2+ ions were the optimum concentrations, at which OILTS achieve the highest yields of the enzyme products (Figure S1). Under the optimal concentrations of these metal ions, OILTS yielded the enzyme products in comparable high yields (Figure 2b), suggesting that OILTS can utilize a broad range of divalent metal ions as cofactors, not limited to Mg2+. It is worthy of note that the yield of the enzyme product in the presence of Zn2+ ion was comparable to Mg2+ ion because the enzyme activities of many terpene synthases are known to be severely decreased when the Zn2+ is used as the cofactor.We thus measured the enzyme reaction kinetics to further investigate the reaction in the presence of the Zn2+ ion. The apparent catalytic efficiency of OILTS with Zn2+ ion was shown to be comparable to that with Mg2+ ion (kcat/KM (Zn2+)=5.56×104 and kcat/KM (Mg2+)=5.18×104 M 1 s 1 ; Figure S6). However, the individual parameters are quite different: Zn2+ ion decreases the turnover number (kcat (Zn2+)=0.48 and kcat (Mg2+)=4.35 s 1 ), while significantly increasing the affinity to the substrate (KM (Zn2+)= 8.59 and KM (Mg2+)=84.09 μM). Thus, these two metals seem to make considerable changes in the environment of the catalytic sites. The enzyme reaction kinetics of OILTS using Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+ cofactors were also measured. Unlike Zn2+ ion, Mn2+ ion showed almost comparable kinetic parameters to that with Mg2+ ions, suggesting that these two metal ions (Mn2+ and Mg2+) work at the catalytic site in a similar way (kcat/KM (Mn2+)= 4.86×104 M 1 s 1 , kcat (Mn2+)=4.34s 1 , and KM (Mn2+)=89.41 μM). Co2+ ion decreased the turnover number but increased the affinity to the substrate like Zn2+ ion, whereas Ni2+ ion decreased both the turnover number and the affinity to the substrate (Figure S6). The observation that OILTS synthesized a different metabolic product 3 by changing the metal cofactor is noteworthy, as enzymes typically exhibit high specificity in cofactor binding, and such cofactor–dependent production of distinct metabolites from the same enzyme is rarely reported. Consequently, we isolated and characterized the structure of 3. In the structural analysis of terpenoid compounds, the crystalline sponge (CS) method, as demonstrated in previous studies, significantly expedites and simplifies the determination of unknown small molecule structures. The method proved highly effective indeed in this research, enabling the rapid elucidation of the structure of product 3 including its absolute stereochemistry without the need of massive scale-up experiment. Utilizing only 9.5 μg of compound 3, we successfully obtained its crystal structure, revealing it to be (+)-cubebol (Figure 3), a sesquiterpenoid previously isolated from a liverwort, a soft coral, and a bacterium.In summary, we have demonstrated that OILTS exhibits high enzyme activity by utilizing a diverse array of metal ions. While Mg2+ remains one of the optimal cofactors, OILTS can achieve a high–yield formation of enzyme products with other metal ions, including Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. Notably, the ability to utilize Zn2+ as a metal cofactor distinguishes OILTS from other known terpene synthases, whose activities are significantly diminished with Zn2+. We also observed the production of another cyclic terpene, 3, in the presence of Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ ions. This marks the first report of a biosynthetic enzyme for the production of 3, representing a rare instance of cofactor-dependent enzyme catalysis to biosynthesize distinct products. The role of OILTS in the giant virus and its host remains unknown. However, we speculate that OILTS\\'s functional plasticity with different metal ions as cofactors could be advantageous for the virus. The types of metal ions accessible to the virus may depend heavily on its hosts, and this aspect may not be controlled by the virus itself. In addition, the change of the enzyme products depending on the metal cofactors may also provide benefits to the virus, similar to the recently reported case of an isoprenyl diphosphate synthase from insect, which changes enzyme products in a metal–dependent manner to satisfy the demand of the insect. Our initial motivation for this study was the hypothesis that OILTS remains at a primitive evolutionary stage. Alternatively, we could also propose that the high functional plasticity of OILTS has evolved uniquely in the viral terpene synthase to adapt to the viral life cycle.\", \"ref_87:Twelve apple PSY gene models were identified in the Phytozome sequence database (Additional file 1). Sequence analysis showed these gene models map to six positions on four chromosomes (3, 9, 11 and 17), suggesting six PSY genes are present in the apple genome. We amplified four of these genes (MdPSY1-4) in fruit for analysis, while two of them, \\'MdPSY5\\' and \\'MdPSY6\\', which are present as additional genes on chromosomes 9 and 11 respectively, did not have transcripts available in the publicly available apple EST libraries so were not further analysed. In order to understand the roles of the multiple apple PSYs in carotenogenesis, we analysed their gene sequences. Comparisons of PCR amplified ‘Royal Gala’ cDNA, and genomic DNA fragments of these genes revealed a strong nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity between MdPSY1 on chromosome 17 and MdPSY2 on chromosome 9, and between MdPSY3 (on chromosome 3) and MdPSY4 (on chromosome 11). MdPSY1 has a predicted 400-amino acid protein while MdPSY2 has a predicted protein of 401 amino acids. MdPSY3 has a stop codon after residue 130, from the original ORF start site, resulting in a truncated protein. There is a potential methionine start site at residue 150, which could result in a 242-amino acid protein. However, it is possible this MdPSY3 transcript, sequenced from four fruit cDNA clones, is a result of mis-splicing; when the MdPSY3 transcript is compared with the MdPSY3 and MdPSY4 genomic DNA sequences, the stop codon appears to be the result of a 15 bp footprint sequence left on exon 3 during the splicing of intron 2. Thus, there could be other correctly spliced MdPSY3 transcripts present in apple without the internal stop codon. Such correctly spliced transcripts would result in a protein sequence identical to MdPSY4, which has an ORF of 1158 bp, encoding a predicted 386-amino acid protein. Multiple sequence comparisons of the predicted proteins indicated that MdPSY1 has 94 % identity to MdPSY2, while MdPSY3 has 98 % identity to PSY4 (Figure 1). In contrast both MdPSY1 and MdPSY2 have 54 % identity to MdPSY4. Comparing genomic and cDNA sequences revealed different exon-intron boundaries for the four PSY genes (Additional file 2). MdPSY1 and MdPSY2 have five exons and four introns, similar to the reported gene structure of the closely related loquat EjPSY2A. MdPSY1 and MdPSY2 have similar exon sizes but differently spliced introns. MdPSY4 has 6 exons and five introns, which is similar to MdPSY3 (both in size and position). Compared with the MdPSY4 protein sequence, the stop codon in MdPSY3 appears to be the result of a 15 bp footprint sequence left on exon 3 during the splicing of intron 2.Phylogenetic analysis of predicted amino acid sequences (including transit peptides) classified PSY1, PSY2, PSY3 and PSY4 into two distinct clades, supporting the observation that these pairs arose from a single duplication event (Fig. 2). Apple MdPSY1 and MdPSY2 form a clade with maize ZmPSY2, rice OsPSY2 and loquat EjPSY2A. On the other hand, MdPSY3 and MdPSY4 grouped together with loquat EjPSY3, cassava MePSY3, and tomato SlPSY3. To test whether the apple PSY genes encode functional enzymes, we used a standard bacterial complementation method for assessing carotenoid pathway enzyme function. Escherichia coli test strains were produced by transforming them with either pACCRTE, which encodes the enzyme to produce GGPP in bacteria, or pACCAR25ΔcrtB (ΔcrtB) which requires PSY function to produce zeaxanthin and its glycosylated derivatives. Next, vectors with cDNA fragments encoding the open reading frame of the apple PSYs with predicted transit peptides removed, were transformed into each of the test strains. MdPSY1 and MdPSY2 constructs in cells with pACCRTE produced phytoene, with a peak whose retention time and spectral qualities were similar to the positive control (Fig. 3a). Similarly, ΔcrtB cells produced zeaxanthin diglucoside when transformed with MdPSY1 and MdPSY2 constructs (Fig. 3b). The extracts from these transformants had distinct yellow colouration and the peak retention times and fine spectral qualities were consistent with HPLC standards and previous publications (Fig. 3b). Surprisingly, MdPSY4 in bacterial cells with pACCRTE or ΔcrtB did not result in the expected product peaks (Fig. 3). The same result was obtained with extended induction periods or using the full-length MdPSY4 including its transit peptide, suggesting MdPSY4 is not able to catalyse the conversion of GGPP to phytoene in bacteria. To ascertain the targeting of the apple PSYs, we fused PCR amplified fragments encoding apple PSYs including their predicted transit peptides to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP). The fusion constructs were transiently expressed in maize etiolated leaf protoplasts and analysed using fluorescent confocal microscopy. Both MdPSY1 and MdPSY2 were co-localised with chlorophyll in the chloroplast confirming they are translocated to plastids (Fig. 4). MdPSY3 has a premature stop codon and was not further tested. MdPSY4 was localized to speckles associated with the chloroplasts (Fig. 4); these speckles are shown to be plastoglobuli using the maize plastoglobulin-2 as marker.\", \\'ref_88:Trichilone A, (1, name proposed by us) was isolated as a white amorphous powder. The elemental composition of 1 was determined by LC-HRMS experiments, the [M + H]+ ion was observed at m/z = 617.2963 which corresponds to C33H45O11 (calculated 617.2962). The elemental composition C33H44O11 reveals that the unsaturation index of 1 is 12. The 1H and 13C 1D NMR spectra display signals for exactly 44 protons and 33 carbons, and according to their chemical shifts the structure of 1 should contain 5 carbonyls and two C-C double bonds suggesting that 1 has five rings. In addition, the 1D NMR data indicate the presence of one methoxy group, five oxygenated but saturated carbons, four non-protonated but saturated carbons, eight saturated CH-groups (of which three are oxygenated), three saturated methylene groups and nine methyl groups. The atom numbering used in this study (see Figure 2) follows the same system as in our previous work, which is based on an earlier study of hortiolide-type limonoids isolated from Hortia colombiana.A careful analysis of the HMBC data gives critical information about the positions of the methyl groups as well as the core structure of 1. The two methyl groups 24-H3 and 25-H3 are both singlets and both give strong HMBC correlations to C-4 and C-5, and to each other’s carbons. 24-H3 and 25-H3 are consequently geminal and attached to the non-protonated C-4, which according to its chemical shift is oxygenated but also connected to C-5. The singlet 19-H3 gives four HMBC correlations, to C-1, C-5, C-9 and C-10, and as C-10 is the only non-protonated carbon of these four, the 19-H3 methyl group is attached to this carbon. This reveals the bond between C-5 and C-10. The singlet 26-H3 gives only three HMBC correlations, to C-8, C-9 and C-14. The non-protonated C-8 displays a chemical shift that suggests it to be oxygenated, and it is consequently to this carbon that the 26-H3 methyl group is attached. Finally, the methyl 18-H3, which is also a singlet, gives HMBC correlations to C-12, C-13, C-14 and C-17, suggesting that is attached to the non-protonated C-13. This reveals the following partial carbon skeleton: C-24/25–C-4–C-5–C-10–C-9–C-8–C-14–C-13–C-18. Strong 1H-1H couplings between 9-H and 11-H (8.0 Hz) and between 11-H and 12-H (11.6 Hz), along with HMBC correlations from 9-H to C-8, C-10 and C-11, from 11-H to C-9 and C-12, and from 12-H to C-11 and C-13, closes the first ring. In this, the chemical shifts for 11-H/C-11 and 12-H/C-12 suggest that these two carbons are oxygenated, more specifically acylated. This is confirmed by the HMBC correlations from 11-H, 2″-H, 3″-H3 and 4″-H3 to C-1″, and internal COSY and HMBC correlations between 2″-H, 3″-H3 and 4″-H3 and their corresponding carbons demonstrate the presence of an isobutyric acid ester at C-11. 12-H. The methyl singlet 2′-H3 give HMBC correlations to C-1′, showing that C-12 has an acetoxy substituent. On the other side of C-13 we find C-17 (with one proton) as discussed above, which is connected to C-16 (with two protons) according to the 1H-1H couplings between 17-H and 16-Ha (8.7 Hz) and between 17-H and 16-Hb (11.1 Hz). This is confirmed by the HMBC correlations from 17-H to C-16, and between 16-H2 to C-17. 14-H and 16-H2 give HMBC correlations to the keto function, while 14-H in addition gives correlations to C-8, C-12, C-13, C-17 and C-18, which show the position and nature of C-15 and close the second ring. The missing substituent on C-17 is a 3-furanyl group, and this partial structure was determined in the same way as with the trichilianones by COSY, HMBC and 1J(C,H) couplings constants. This forms the third ring accounting by itself for three unsaturations, and the NMR data are quite similar to those reported for other limonoids containing a 3-furanyl substituent. COSY and HMBC correlations between 5-H and 6-H2, and these protons and C-6 and C-7, and the HMBC correlation of the methoxy protons to C-7 show that this carbon is not part of a lactone. We have already noted that C-1 is connected to C-10, and the COSY correlation between 1-H and 2-H2 in addition to the HMBC correlations between 1-H and C-3 and C-3 and between 2-H2 and C-1, C-3 and C-10 demonstrate this partial structure. Evidence that C-3 is part of an ε-lactone, the fourth ring, is shown by the weak but clear HMBC correlation between 24-H3 and C-3. All protons and carbons are now accounted for, remaining one oxygen and the formation of a fifth ring. As it has been determined that both C-1 and C-8 are oxygenated, the formation of a tetrahydrofuran ring with the last oxygen bond to these both carbons is the only way to finalize the structure elucidation. A similar ring system has been identified in limonoids from species belonging to the genus Hortia.The relative stereostructure of 1 was determined by analyzing its NOESY 2D spectra. No NOESY correlation was observed between 18-H3 and 12-H, 14-H or 17-H, suggesting that the latter three protons are positioned on the opposite side compared to the methyl group (which would be α if the stereostructure in Figure 2 is absolute). This was confirmed by the correlations observed between 12-H and 17-H, and between both these protons and 14-H (all three β). However, 18-H3 gives clear correlations to 11-H, 16-Hb, 21-H, 22-H and 26-H3, showing that these are on the same side as C-18. 26-H3 correlates with 1-H and 9-H (all α), but not with 14-H, while 19-H3 correlate with 1-H, 2-Hb, 6-H2, 9-H and 25-H3. 25-H3 (α) correlates with 2-Hb, while 24-H3 (β) correlates with 5-H. Finally, the observed correlation between 1-H and 9-H (both α) establishes the suggested relative stereostructure as shown in Figure 2. The fact that 9-H, C-19 and C-26 are on the same side of the molecule, would bend the molecule along C-8/C-9 and explain the weak NOESY correlations observed between 12-H, 14-H, 5-H and 6-H2, even if they on paper appear to be too far apart. The corresponding configuration has also been suggested in hortiolide-type limonoids.Trichilone C, (3) was obtained as a solid amorphous powder. Its elemental composition was determined to be C34H46O12, by LC-HMRS experiments in which the molecular appeared at m/z = 647.3073 [M + H]+ (calculated for C34H47O12 647.3068). Compared to 2, 3 has one extra oxygen, and examination of the NMR 1D 1H and 13C NMR data suggests that a saturated methine on 2 has been hydroxylated in 3. The signals for 45 protons can be observed in the proton spectrum, supporting the suggestion that a hydroxyl group with an exchangeable proton has been introduced. Seven of the 12 unsaturations are accounted for five carbonyl groups and two C-C double bonds, so 3 has consequently five rings just as 1 and 2.Most of the COSY and HMBC correlations discussed above for 1 and 2 can also be observed in the 2D spectra of 3, suggesting that 3 has a similar structure. A major difference is the transformation of the 11-H from a double doublet to a doublet in the proton spectrum. 11-H only couples with 12-H in 3, not to 9-H, and it appears as if C-9 is the carbon that has been hydroxylated, as a HMQC experiment revealed that C-9 is no longer protonated. By examining the correlations in the HMBC spectrum, it is evident that the protons in the vicinity of C-9 (1-H, 11-H, 19-H3 and 26-H3) correlate with a new carbon resonance at 89.2 ppm, which consequently is the hydroxylated C-9. When assigning the relative configuration of 3 using the data from NOESY experiments, the corresponding correlations as discussed above were noted. This includes correlations from 26-H3 to 1-H and 11-H, from 12-H to 14-H and 17-H, and from 19-H3 to 11-H, 6-H2 and 2-Hb. This suggest that the configuration of C-9 is the same as in 1/2, and this is confirmed by the NOESY correlations from 12-H and 14-H to 5-H, caused by the folding of the molecule (also discussed above).\\', \\'ref_89:Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases catalyze oxidation reactions at physiological conditions by using molecular oxygen. In contrast to conventional oxidation chemistry, this constitutes an environmentally friendly alternative. In addition, there is an increased demand for biologically produced flavorings and aromatic compounds. The latter are often selective oxidation products of terpenes and terpenoids—both common CYP102A1 substrates. The fatty acid hydroxylase CYP102A1 is one of the most promising monooxygenases for application in preparative synthesis. Various mutations (often in the substrate entrance region) have been described that widen the substrate scope toward more bulky molecules. However, for many of the substrates the wild-type enzyme (or variants with extended substrate spectra) show low selectivity, or the desired product is not obtained. Thus, an efficient strategy to design an enzyme with desired selectivity is needed. Directed evolution is a powerful method to change and improve enzyme properties such as activity, stability and selectivity. However, this approach relies on effective screening assays, because a large number of variants have to be generated and screened. This is straightforward with assays for activity or stability. However, if directed evolution is applied to improve regio-, chemo-, or stereoselectivity, the reaction products have to be quantitatively analyzed. Even though high-throughput screening methods for selectivity on the basis of GC analysis have been developed, increasing efforts have been undertaken to limit the size of mutant libraries by focusing mutagenesis on potential substrate-interacting residues, selected by examination of the crystal structure information.However, because of the large and diverse substrate binding cavity of CYP enzymes, the number of potential substrate-interacting residues is of the order of ten; thus a combinatorial library would be too large to be screened. However, by an integrated approach of sequence analysis, molecular modeling, and screening of focused libraries, we drastically reduced the size of mutant library to be screened. After only three rounds of modeling, design, and screening we were able to extend the product spectra of CYP102A1 to include perillyl alcohol (round 1: screening of the previously designed minimal CYP102A1 library). Subsequently, we identified two additional mutations at position 437 (round 2) and position 264 (round 3), where amino acid substitutions increased the selectivity for the new product up to 97%. This is among the highest regioselectivities for terminal hydroxylation ever reported for the comprehensively investigated CYP102A1 enzyme. With our approach, the screening of only 29 variants was sufficient to turn a generally unselective enzyme (which does not show terminal hydroxylation activity) into a catalyst that equals CYP153A11, a specialized enzyme for terminal hydroxylation. The initial activity measured for perillyl alcohol formation by the most selective variant is in the same range as that observed for CYP153A11. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement of activity. As the substrate entrance to the active site cavity has a strong influence on activity, we expect that mutations in this region (far away from the heme) could improve activity drastically without interfering with selectivity. As an alternative, directed evolution could be applied to improve overall stability, solubility, and activity, as was shown previously for CYP102A1 to improve its activity toward limonene and other compounds.The conversion of molecules of similar shape but with different intrinsic reactivity confirmed our observations from modeling: the orientation of the substrate close to the activated heme oxygen is a major determinant of regio- and chemoselectivity. Because of this shape selectivity, nonactivated carbon atoms are oxidized even in the presence of other reactive atoms. This is in agreement with previous reports that showed that CYP102A1 can be engineered for hydroxylation at the nonactivated terminal positions of alkanes. As mutants of CYP102A1 have been shown to accept a wide range of substrates, and the minimal library was highly enriched for selective catalysts towards cyclic and acyclic alkanes, we are confident that our approach is generic and can be successfully applied to develop highly selective oxidation catalysts for a wide range of substrates.\\', \\'ref_90:Germacrone can be isolated on a multigram scale from the essential oils of Baccharis latifolia and Geranium macrorrhizum. To assure the availability of this starting material, we are optimizing Geranium macrorrhizum cultures for the sustainable production of germacrone. Some transannular cyclization reactions of germacrone mediated by different electrophiles have also been described, leading fundamentally to bicyclic compounds with eudesmane and occasionally guaiane and cadinane structures. In this regard, we have recently reported the first results showing a new type of transannular cyclization of germacrone mediated by HSO3Cl at low temperature. Easily available from germacrone, epoxides germacrone-4,5-epoxide, germacrone-1,10-epoxide, and isogermacrone-4,5-epoxide also possess a latent reactivity that gives these molecules the potential to be converted into different molecular skeletons only by varying the reagents used. Epoxides are also natural products isolated mainly from the rhizomes of different species of Curcuma. Some examples of the reactivity of epoxides against different acid media were also described. Thus, germacrone-4,5-epoxide was reported to lead mainly to guaianes, whereas eudesmanes were the major products resulting from the transannular cyclizations of germacrone-1,10-epoxide and isogermacrone-4,5-epoxide.The topic is Structural diversity from transannular cyclizations of germacrone and its epoxy derivatives, combining experimental and theoretical approaches to explore sesquiterpene biosynthesis. The study involved the synthesis of germacrone and its epoxy derivatives, followed by their characterization using spectroscopic methods such as NMR and mass spectrometry. Theoretical approaches, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, were employed to predict the possible cyclization pathways and to understand the energetics and mechanisms of the reactions. The combination of these methods provided a comprehensive understanding of the structural diversity generated through transannular cyclizations in sesquiterpene biosynthesis.\\', \\'ref_91:Under natural sunlight irradiation with an average intensity of 5000 lux for 16 hours, neat compounds of both xyloelves A (1a) and B (1b) generated trace amount of 6 (Fig. 2B and table S1), which was produced via the C → C intramolecular 1,2-acyl migration. Upon treatment of 1a with the same average intensity of sunlight irradiation in acetonitrile for 16 hours, 7 (Fig. 2B and table S1) was obtained in 30.1% isolated yield along with 28.0% of recovered 1a. When the solvent of the above sunlight irradiation experiment was replaced by dichloromethane, either with or without FeCl2, both 1a and 1b were decomposed at last. Treatment of 1a or 1b in methanol under average 5000 lux of sunlight irradiation for 1 to 3 hours, 2a/3a or 2b/3b (Fig. 2B and table S1), was observed in pairs as photoproducts but in less than 2.0% yield. Disappointingly, both 1a and 1b were ultimately decomposed when the time of sunlight irradiation was extended to 16 hours. To figure out the light wavelength band that really triggered the above photochemical reactions, different light sources, including blue and white light-emitting diode tubes; green, yellow, and red halogen bulbs; and UV 254-, 302-, and 365-nm lamps, were thoroughly investigated (table S1). However, only UV light irradiation at 302 nm notably generated photoproducts. Pleasingly, 2a and 3a were simultaneously produced in methanol in 35.3 and 21.1% yields, respectively, when 1a was irradiated with 302-nm UV light for 1.5 hours. In the same way, 2b and 3b were concurrently obtained in 30.2 and 15.1% yields, respectively, when 1b was chosen as the substrate (table S1). Therefore, UV at 302 nm was selected as the right wavelength for further optimization of photochemical reaction conditions.As expected, upon 302-nm UV light irradiation at room temperature in different solvents, xyloelves A (1a) and B (1b) underwent skeletal reorganization to afford eight photoproducts containing five unprecedented limonoid scaffolds, viz., 2a/2b, 3a/3b, 4p/4, 5, and 6, and a derivative with a 17-substituted γ(23)-hydroxybutenolide group (7) (Fig. 2, B and C). To find the optimal reaction condition, the influence of solvent and UV light irradiation time on photochemical transformation rates of the above substrates, viz., 1a and 1b, was scrupulously investigated (tables S2 to S4). As a result, UV light irradiation in the solvent mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water (1:1) for 1.0 hour was the optimal reaction condition for the transformation of 1a into both 2a and 3a, isolated in 43.1 and 30.5% yields, respectively. Under the same condition, 2b and 3b were obtained from the substrate 1b in 67.2 and 17.3% isolated yields, respectively. UV light irradiation of 1a in benzene for 1.5 hours afforded 4p in 53.1% isolated yield, whereas that in ethyl acetate generated 7 in 26.3% isolated yield (Table 1 and table S2). Upon treatment of 1a with UV light irradiation in dichloromethane for 0.5 hours, followed by addition of methanol, 4 and 5 were obtained in 13.0 and 10.2% isolated yields, respectively (Table 1 and table S3). The optimal reaction condition for the transformation of 1a into 6 was in dichloromethane with excess FeCl2 for 1.5 hours. To our delight, 6 was obtained in 33.6% isolated yield (Table 1). Notably, three photosensitizers, viz., methylene blue, rose bengal, and ferroporphyrin, were screened for the improvement of photoinitiation efficiency in the transformation of 1a into 6. However, no notable effects were observed at last (table S4).The thermodynamic retrotransformation of 2a into 1a and that of 2b into 1b, respectively, was observed when the pure compound 2a or 2b was kept away from light in common solvents, such as acetone, acetonitrile, and methanol, at room temperature (normally 20° to 30°C) for several days. To unveil the fast thermodynamic retrotransformation of 2b into 1b, variable temperature 1H-NMR spectroscopy analyses were carried out. The photoproduct 2b was dissolved in DMSO-d6 in an NMR tube and then heated to 90°C. Every 10 min, the 1H-NMR spectrum was recorded to monitor the retrotransformation rate of 2b into 1b, which could be calculated on the basis of the peak area ratio of characteristic proton signals of both compounds, such as H-6 and H-22. As expected, 40% of 2b was transformed into 1b after maintaining the temperature of the NMR tube at 90°C for 50.0 min (Fig. 2C).The structures and relative configurations of all the aforementioned photoproducts, viz., 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4p, and 4 to 7, were established by 1D and 2D NMR spectra, whereas the absolute configurations of these limonoids were determined on the basis of the same absolute configuration of the remained δ-lactone ring-D, i.e., (13R,17R), occurring in substrates (1a/1b) and all the photochemical products (figs. S1 and S2) (see the Supplementary Materials for detailed structural elucidation). Most notably, the constitution of 3b and its absolute configuration, i.e., (1R,4S,5S,6R,9R,10S,13R,17R,33S), were unequivocally established by single-crystal x-ray diffraction analysis, conducted with Cu Kα radiation [Flack parameter of 0.09 (9) and Hooft parameter of 0.08 (7)] (CCDC 2159543; Fig. 2A).To gain mechanistic insights into photoinduced late-stage skeletal reorganization of limonoid natural products, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations at the M06/6-31G(d, p)/the integral equation formalism variant with the solvent dichloromethane [IEFPCM(DCM)] level of theory were performed. Xyloelf A (1a) was chosen as a model substrate, which could be transformed into five products, viz., 2a, 3a, and 4 to 6, via different photocascade pathways. The thermodynamic retrotransformation of 2a into 1a was also confirmed by theoretical calculations (tables S5 to S7).Two excited singlet states of 1a, viz., S1 and S2, were found by means of TD-DFT calculations (Fig. 3A). The energy levels of S1 and S2 were well matched with the UV absorption wavelengths of 298 and 313 nm, respectively. Once formed, the singlet diradical S1 could undergo a spin forbidden intersystem crossing process to produce the excited triplet state T1, of which the energy level was 1.89 eV lower than that of S1. The two corresponding singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs), namely, SOMO and SOMO-1, located on the 17-furyl group and the 8,8a-dihydro-1H-isochromen-3(7H)-one moiety of 1a, respectively, were obtained by DFT calculations for the excited triplet state T1 (Fig. 3A). Hence, the UV light excitation process could be considered as an intramolecular single-electron transfer. That is to say, the 17-furyl group of 1a donated one electron to the electron-deficient 8,8a-dihydro-1H-isochromen-3(7H)-one moiety of the limonoid skeleton, with the aim for further transformations.In the absence of water, three products could be obtained. Free energy profiles for the transformation of the complex substrate 1a into three products, viz., 4, 5, and 6, were obtained by DFT calculations (Fig. 3B). The energy of T1 was set to relative zero. Starting from T1, an intramolecular radical-type acyl shift from C30 to C9, with cleavage of the C2─C30 bond and generation of the C2─C9 bond, i.e., C → C 1,4-acyl migration, would occur via the transition state TS1 to afford the intermediate INT1. Then, the isobutyryloxy moiety of INT1 could be activated by an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of the isobutyryloxy moiety and the C30─OH group. Sequent proton transfer via the transition state TS2, overcoming an energy barrier of only 3.0 kcal/mol, would lead to a rapid C─O bond cleavage and the loss of one molecule of isobutyric acid, irreversibly generating the key pyranolate intermediate INT2. Notably, INT2-1 was another essential resonance structure of INT2. On the basis of INT2, three possible pathways might be considered for the generation of diverse photoproducts. The orbital analysis for the SOMO of INT2 revealed the electronic sharing between C8 and C15. Thus, the cleavage of the C30─O ether bond, activated by radicals, would occur via the transition state TS4, surmounting an energy barrier of only 5.7 kcal/mol, to yield the ketene intermediate INT3, of which the energy level was 6.1 kcal/mol lower than that of INT2, indicating a reversible process between INT2 and INT3. Hence, the final photoproducts might be dependent on solvents. In the presence of methanol, 4 was found as the kinetic product for the above reaction.Alternatively, INT2 could undergo a C9─C10 bond cleavage via the transition state TS5 to afford INT4, of which the energy level was 7.4 kcal/mol lower than that of INT3. The calculated activation barrier for the transformation of INT2 into INT4 was 15.4 kcal/mol. With the aid of methanol, INT4 could be successfully transformed into the thermodynamic product 5. In the absence of methanol, however, INT2 would undergo the C → C 1,3-acyl migration via the open-shell singlet transition state TS3 to give 6 as the final product (Fig. 3B).In the presence of water, either 2a or 3a could be provided from the same substrate 1a. DFT calculations were used to unveil the detailed transformation mechanism. Starting from the common T1 state of 1a, the formation of INT1 could share with the former pathway via the transition state TS1 with a free energy barrier of 4.4 kcal/mol (Fig. 3C). In presence of the water, the intermediate INT2′ could be obtained with bridged hydrogen bonds of carbonyl and hydroxyl moieties in the INT1 with an exothermic process of 4.1 kcal/mol. Subsequently, a water-assisted intramolecular hydrogen shift could occur and then resulted in a rearrangement of the hydroxyl alkyl radical in the intermediate INT3′ via the transition state TS2′ with a free energy barrier of 3.2 kcal/mol. In the triplet intermediate INT3′, the spin density was majorly shared by C2, C15, and C30. Therefore, either water-assisted hydrogen atom transfer to C15 or radical-type substitution onto C30 was possible, leading to two possible pathways for the generation of different products. The spin density on C15 exhibited the hydrogen-acceptor character, where C15 could achieve a hydrogen atom transfer from the hydroxyl alkyl moiety. In the presence of a water bridge, this hydrogen atom transfer could occur via the transition state TS3′ with a free energy barrier of only 0.8 kcal/mol. After releasing a molecule of water, the product 3a could be formed by this pathway. Alternatively, TS4′ could be considered as an initial radical addition of C2 onto the lactone moiety, accompanied by the cleavage of C30─O ether bond. After releasing a molecule of water, another product 2a would be yielded. The calculated relative free energy of the transition state TS4′ was only 1.0 kcal/mol higher than that of TS3′. Therefore, both 2a and 3a could be experimentally observed. Once 2a was formed, a water-assisted retro-Michael addition could occur via the transition state TS5′, leading to the cleavage of the C2─C9 bond. Meanwhile, the water bridge resulted in the acetalation for the formation of the C30─O ether bond. The above synergetic process lastly afforded the substrate 1a, which was 4.3 kcal/mol more stable than 2a. Notably, the direct thermodynamic retrotransformation from 2a into 1a was hard to overcome an energy barrier of 34.9 kcal/mol via the transition state TS6′, indicating the pivotal role of the water bridge for the above intramolecular proton transfer.\\', \"ref_92:Synthetic vectors for transgene therapy have the advantage over viral vectors of being more biocompatible, having a lower immunogenic effect with simplicity of production and application. Current commercially available cationic lipids used for siRNA delivery have a common structural motif that includes a hydrophilic headgroup linked typically to two non-rigid (flexible) hydrophobic tails. Herein, five novel lipids, 1–5 having a common rigid C30-carotenoid hydrophobic domain, while differing in the nature of the amphiphilic headgroups, were synthesized and evaluated for liposome and lipoplex formation. In addition, these cationic carotenoid lipids were evaluated for their effectiveness to deliver a specific GL2 siRNA to effect knockdown of luciferase activity in the HR5-CL11 cell line in cell culture, compared to control lipids DC-Chol and EPC.Cationic choline-ester analogues were prepared in high yields from β-apo-8\\'-carotenoic acid (7), obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of ethyl-β-apo-8\\'-carotenoate (6) (Scheme 1 and Scheme 2). Esterifications were performed with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 4-dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP) and bromoethanol with subsequent amination or directly with the appropriate aminoethanol derivatives. The alcohols were used in excess to ensure rapid transformation. After reaction, alcohol and the urea by-product from DCC were removed by extraction and precipitation from cold acetone, respectively. The aminoethanol esters were purified by flash-column chromatography (CC) and recrystallized from acetone. HBr salts were prepared by addition of aqueous HBr to the neutral amines with subsequent freeze-drying and recrystallization in acetone. The aminoethanol esters were quaternized with excess methyl iodide in THF. The crude salts were isolated by filtration and recrystallized in acetone.Our work was inspired by the hypothesis that single-chain, rigid cationic lipids would tightly self-assemble around negatively charged nucleic acids, resulting in stable lipoplexes that perform knockdown as effectively, or better than the known rigid cationic vector, DC-Chol. Liposome particle sizing was the initial study to assess the self-assembling characteristics of our novel, single-chain rigid cationic lipids, 1–5, together with the known rigid vector, DC-Chol, and non-rigid lipid EPC. In a first step, cationic liposomes were prepared through the sonication of a hydrated thin film of lipids formed upon elimination of ethanol by rotary evaporation. The liposome particle size data obtained by dynamic light scattering (Figure 3) reveals a range in average liposome diameter between 100–400 nm for the majority of the lipids analyzed, with the exception of lipid 2, which resulted in average liposome diameters of 757 nm. Interestingly, liposomes composed of EPC were generally smaller than all of the rigid cationic lipids in this study, including DC-Chol.The lipid headgroup choices were based on groups common to those that are presented in the literature. The positive charge associated with headgroups composed of quaternary ammonium salts is isolated mainly on nitrogen, whereas this charge can be delocalized to the N-H bond in lower order salts. This delocalization of charge permits the surrounding water molecules to reduce the positive charge through hydrogen bonding interactions. This interaction of HBr salts (1- and 4-based liposomes) with water participates in the stabilization of liposomes in the aqueous media. Liposomes prepared from lipids 3–5 containing hydroxyl moieties at the headgroups may exhibit a similar stabilizing effect through the interaction with surrounding water molecules. In contrast, lipid 2 containing a quaternary ammonium cannot participate in such stabilization, and thus gave rise to the formation of aggregates upon hydration.Combining the negatively charged siRNA with the cationic liposomes resulted in lipoplex formation initially mediated by electrostatic interactions and subsequently by hydrophobic effects. The carotenoid lipid/siRNA lipoplexes assemble into nanosized particles ranging from 100–550 nm diameters, where the smallest particles correspond to lipoplexes with a (+/−) molar charge ratio of 2.5, and largest particles at a (+/−) molar charge ratio of 10:1, as expected. Aggregates ranging in size from 1 to 5 µm were detected in all lipoplex samples, particularly with lipoplexes prepared from the carotenoid lipid 2. Only the major populations formed by the submicron size particles were taken into consideration in the calculation of lipoplex size. The efficiency of the lipoplex-mediated siRNA delivery (the ability of lipid-transported GL2 anti-luciferase to knockdown the luciferase expression compared to that of naked GL2 alone) was investigated by a luciferase knockdown assay in HR5-CL11 cells, stably transfected with the luciferase reporter via a tetracycline controlled transcriptional trans-activator. Cells were transfected with lipoplexes for 4 h before the media was replaced with complete growth media containing antibiotics followed by incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 h before performing the assay.In general, the data revealed variable knockdown performance for the different vectors assayed (Figure 4). Lipoplexes composed from lipid 4 did not result in knockdown activity, whereas those composed of carotenoid lipids 1, 2, 3 and 5 revealed significant anti-luciferase capacity for the GL2 anti-luciferase treated group at one or more (+/−) charge ratios studied. Lipoplexes composed from lipid 2 revealed a moderate anti-luciferase capacity at (+/−) charge ratio 5 for the GL2 anti-luciferase treated group (p < 0.05). Formulations that displayed significant efficiency towards luciferase knockdown in GL2 treated HR5 CL11 cells over non-treated cells (p < 0.01) are those containing lipid 1 at the lowest (+/−) charge ratio studied, lipid 2 with (+/−) charge ratios of 7.5, and lipid 5 at the highest (+/−) charge ratio studied. All lipoplexes containing lipid 3 formulated with (+/−) charge ratios of 2.5–10 displayed significant efficiency towards luciferase knockdown in GL2 treated HR5 CL11 cells. Cells treated with control siRNA-containing formulations revealed equal or greater luciferase signal than those treated with GL2 (data not shown). Although these novel carotenoid lipids revealed promising efficiencies within particular (+/−) charge ratios, none proved as efficient in knocking down luciferase expression as the control lipids, DC-Chol and EPC, two known non-viral gene delivery agents.It is well documented that the charge ratio of the positive lipid to negative nucleic acid cargo affects toxicity, with higher (+/−) charge ratios generally being more toxic. The toxicity of lipoplexes may cause inflammatory reactions by interaction with the reticuloendothelial system (RES). The cytotoxicity associated with the carotenoid-based lipoplexes and those of DC-Chol and EPC with (+/−) molar charge ratios ranging from 2.5 to 10, was determined on the HR5-CL11 cell line after a 48 h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 using the MTS assay. Results reported in Figure 5 reveal concentration-dependent cytotoxicity associated with all lipoplex formulations, with the exception of the carotenoid lipid 4, and EPC. Lipoplexes containing lipid 2, as well as those formulated from 3–5 (functionalized with hydroxyl moieties at the lipid headgroup) were found to be cytotoxic beyond (+/−) molar charge ratio 5, with less than 50% cell viability. Lipoplexes containing lipid 1 and EPC were very well tolerated by the HR5 CL11 cells at all charge ratios studied. Those containing DC-Chol exhibited high cytotoxicity beyond charge ratio 2.5.\", \\'ref_93:The mean particle size, PDI and zeta potential of NCs are shown in Table 1. ORI-NCs exhibited the size around 274\\\\u2009nm; the small PDI indicates narrow distribution of particle size. ORI/DiO-NCs demonstrated similar particle size with only a little increase, and their zeta potential was close to neutral.In order to explore the stability of ORI-NCs and ORI/DiO-NCs, ORI-NCs and ORI/DiO-NCs were stored in dark place at 4\\\\u2009°C for 48\\\\u2009h and 30 days, separately. Then, their particle size, PDI and zeta potential were measured by DLS. As Table 2 shows, both of the NCs did not demonstrate significant after storage. Thus, ORI-NCs and ORI/DiO-NCs were stable and could be used in the following experiment.The TEM images of ORI-NCs are shown in Figure 3. ORI-NCs were like balls in shape with the size around 280\\\\u2009nm, which was consistent with the result of DLS analysis.As Figure 4(A) shows, sharp peaks in the diffraction patterns of ORI bulk drug could be observed, while PVP exhibited no peaks. At the same angle with ORI bulk drug, sharp peaks existed in the diffraction pattern of ORI-NCs and physical mixture of ORI and PVP, illustrating that the crystal form of ORI was not changed in the preparation of NCs.As Figure 4(B) shows, the endothermic peaks of ORI bulk drug and PVP corresponded to the temperatures of 253\\\\u2009°C and 68\\\\u2009°C, respectively. Both peaks could be observed in the curves of mixture of ORI and PVP. Per the curve of ORI-NCs, endothermic peaks existed at the same temperature with that of ORI bulk drug. Thus, the crystallography characteristics of ORI in NCs were the same with that of bulk drugs.The dissolution profiles of pure ORI, ORI-NCs in water are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that the raw material possessed a slow dissolution, and the accumulative dissolution was just 44.3% at 120\\\\u2009min. The dissolution rate of pure ORI was limited to a great extent by its poor water solubility. ORI suspensions exhibited a rapid dissolution in the first 5\\\\u2009min, the accumulative dissolution was 33.5% at 5\\\\u2009min, the accumulative dissolution was 67.9% at 120\\\\u2009min. The dissolutions of pure ORI and ORI-NCs were incomplete. The phenomenon suggested that ORI dissolution was either dominated by the intrinsic solubility or by the dispersity and wettability.In Figure 6, both free ORI and ORI-NCs exhibited effect on inhibition the proliferation of MDCK cells. Cell viability was decreased with the increase of concentration, which suggested the concentration-dependent effect of ORI-NCs and ORI bulk drug on MDCK cells. There was no significant difference between free ORI and ORI-NCs on cell viability at concentration of 8.5 and 17\\\\u2009μg/mL. At higher concentration (34, 84 and 135\\\\u2009μg/mL), ORI-NCs significantly reduced the cell viability compared with free ORI (p\\\\u2009<\\\\u20090.05, p\\\\u2009<\\\\u20090.01).\\', \\'ref_94:To identify the GA20ox, GA3ox, and GA2ox genes in M. truncatula, a BLASTP search using the A. thaliana AtGA20ox, AtGA3ox, and AtGA2ox genes against M. truncatula database was executed. A total of 23 candidate genes were obtained in the M. truncatula genome, including 8 MtGA20ox, 2 MtGA3ox, and 13 MtGA2ox (Table S1). These MtGAox genes were named based on their closest Arabidopsis orthologs. The gene names, accession numbers, locations, coding sequence (CDS) lengths and the number of the deduced amino acid are summarized in Table S1.To establish the evolutionary relationships within the MtGAox genes, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the 39 GAox proteins from M. truncatula and A. thaliana, including 5 AtGA20ox, 8 MtGA20ox, 4 AtGA3ox, 2 MtGA3ox, 7 AtGA2ox, and 13 MtGA2ox. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the 39 GAox proteins were divided into four subfamilies (Figure 1): the gibberellin biosynthesis gene family contained the GA20ox and GA3ox genes, and the gibberellin deactivation GA2ox genes could be divided into C19- and C20-GA2ox subgroups.The 23 MtGAox genes were distributed among 8 chromosomes (Figure S2A). The chromosome 02, 01 and 08, 07, 03 and 04 had six, four, three, and two genes, respectively, while the chromosome 05 and 06 each contained only one.To get a better understanding of the structural diversity of the MtGAox genes, the structures (exon/intron organization) of MtGAox were analyzed (Figure S2B). MtGA20ox and MtGA2ox genes had the same structure, which all contain three exons. However, all the MtGA3ox genes had two exons. Exon-intron organization indicated that MtGA20ox and MtGA2ox genes were more closely related than MtGA3ox genes.To obtain a better understanding of the protein sequence characteristics of the MtGAox, MEME search was used to analyze the conserved domains and motifs. Based on the composition of motifs, the MtGAox proteins contained nine different motifs (Figure 2; Figure S3). Motif 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 were identified as the conserved motif, which was present in every MtGAox protein. Motif 1 and 2 are representative 2OG-FeII_Oxy domain and Motif 3 is representative DIOX_N domain, which are identified in all GAox proteins. Motif 5 was only identified in C-terminal of MtGA20ox proteins, indicating that members within a single subfamily usually exhibit similar motif composition. However, motif 8 was located in the C-terminal part of some members of the MtGA2ox protein family, demonstrating that this motif is related to the functions of these MtGA2ox proteins.The tissue-specific expression patterns of a gene family can provide information about its possible function. To understand the functional divergence of the MtGAox genes, we analyzed the expression profiles of the MtGAox genes in different organs/tissues by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and gene expression atlas (Figure 3; Figures S4 and S5). The results indicated that GA biosynthesis gene MtGA20ox1, MtGA20ox4, MtGA20ox5, MtGA20ox7, and MtGA3ox1 were widely expressed in all tissues examined (Figure 3A). While, MtGA20ox3 and MtGA20ox6 had higher expression levels in stems, MtGA20ox2, MtGA20ox8, and MtGA3ox2 had higher expression levels in flowers, pods, and roots (Figure 3A), respectively, implying important roles of these genes in certain organs or tissues. Most of the GA deactivation genes, such as MtGA2ox1, MtGA2ox2, MtGA2ox6, MtGA2ox8, MtGA2ox9, MtGA2ox10, MtGA2ox11, MtGA2ox12, and MtGA2ox13 were widely expressed in all organs tested (Figure 3B). However, MtGA2ox4 and MtGA2ox7 were expressed at higher levels in flowers than those in other tissues (Figure 3B), implying their possible involvement in flower development.When GA is present, the GID1 receptors bind to GA and this binding promotes the interaction of GID1 with DELLA proteins, which are degraded in the 26S proteasome later (Figure S6). To identify MtGID1 and MtDELLA proteins in M. truncatula, BLASTP searches were performed using 3 AtGID1 and 5 AtDELLA sequences. A total of three GA receptor proteins, MtGID1A, MtGID1B, and MtGID1C, and 3 MtDELLA proteins, MtDELLA1, MtDELLA2, and MtDELLA3, were identified (Table S2; Figure 4A; Figures S7 and S8;). Gene structure analysis showed that the MtDELLA genes had the same exon–intron organization with no intron, whereas the intron of MtGID1 genes ranged from 1 to 2 (Figure 4B).To gain better insights into the potential functions of MtGID1 and MtDELLA genes, their expression patterns were analyzed (Figure 5; Figures S9 and S10). The qRT-PCR results indicated that MtDELLA1 and MtDELLA2 had similar expression patterns and were detected at low levels in all tissues, indicating that MtDELLA1 and MtDELLA2 are involved in many aspects of growth and development. Moreover, MtDELLA3 had higher expression level in pods compared to that in root and stems (Figure 5A), implying that MtDELLA3 may play more important roles in pod development. The expression levels of MtGID1B and MtGID1C were higher in root than those in other tissues (Figure 5B), demonstrating that MtGID1B and MtGID1C may play a significant role in root development than other tissues. However, MtGID1A was widely expressed in all tissues tested (Figure 5B), although at low level, suggesting that it may be involved in multiple developmental processes.In DELLA protein, two important and conserved motifs, DELLA and VHYNP, are involved in the interaction with GID1 proteins. In addition, the SUMO-Interaction Motif (SIM), which is important for the recognition of SUMOylated DELLA proteins, is also highly conserved between GID1s. Multiple sequences alignment showed that the three MtDELLA proteins had the typical DELLA and VHYNP domains (Figure 6A; Figure S11) and the three MtGID1 receptors had the conserved DELLA interaction SIM motif (Figure 6B; Figure S11). To verify that the MtDELLA and MtGID1 proteins are functional GA signaling components, we assessed the interaction between MtDELLAs and MtGID1s using the yeast two-hybrid system (Figure 7). We also performed the interaction tests between MtDELLAs and MtGID1s in opposite orientation and obtained the same results (Figure S12). MtGID1s interacted with MtDELLA1 and MtDELLA2 in yeast cells in the presence of GA3, but not in GA3-free medium, while MtGID1s could not interact with MtDELLA3. These results indicate that all three MtGID1s are functional GA receptors and MtDELLA1 and MtDELLA2 may play more important roles in the GA pathway.Previous studies indicated that feedback regulation controls the concentrations of active GAs in higher plants and the gibberellin metabolism genes also respond to exogenous GA treatment. To investigate whether the expression level of MtGA20ox, MtGA3ox, and MtGA2ox are regulated by a feedback mechanism, leaves were treated with GA3 and gibberellin inhibitor PAC, and the transcriptional changes were analyzed using qRT-PCR (Figure 8). qRT-PCR results showed that the transcript levels of MtGA20ox1, MtGA20ox2, MtGA20ox6 and MtGA3ox1 were downregulated after 24 h treatment of 50 µM and 100 µM GA3 (Figure 8A), indicating that these genes respond quickly to exogenous GA3 treatment. On the opposite, the expressions of MtGA20ox3, MtGA20ox4, MtGA20ox5, MtGA20ox8, and MtGA3ox2 were upregulated when treated with 100 µM GA3 (Figure 8A), implying that upregulation of these genes may compensate for the downregulation of MtGA20ox1, MtGA20ox2, MtGA20ox6, and MtGA3ox1 genes to balance the GA level in plant. However, the transcript levels of MtGA20ox5, MtGA20ox8, MtGA3ox1, and MtGA3ox2 were upregulated when treated with 100 µM PAC (Figure 8A), indicating that these genes may play important roles in GA synthesis. Meanwhile, GA treatment promoted the transcription of some MtGA2ox genes, such as MtGA2ox2, MtGA2ox3, MtGA2ox4, MtGA2ox5, MtGA2ox6, MtGA2ox7, MtGA2ox10, and MtGA2ox13 (Figure 8B), demonstrating that these genes may have key roles in GA inactivation. After treatment with PAC, the downregulated genes were MtGA2ox1, MtGA2ox2, MtGA2ox4, MtGA2ox10, MtGA2ox11, and MtGA2ox12 (Figure 8B). These data showed that MtGA20oxs are responsible for the regulation of bioactive GA synthesis and MtGA2oxs regulate the degradation of GA.To further investigate the in vivo function of GA, wild-type Medicago plants were transformed with 35S:MtGA20OX1 (Figure S13A). Fourteen regeneration lines were obtained and eleven were positive by PCR analysis (Figure S13B). Quantitative real-time PCR data showed that transcripts of MtGA20OX1 were significantly increased in these transgenic plants, and the overexpression lines (OE) 3 and 9 were selected for further analysis (Figure S12C). To evaluate the effects of MtGA20OX1 expression on Medicago development, the following traits were measured: leaf size, plant height, and biomass. Under the same growth conditions, the MtGA20OX1 overexpression lines exhibited larger cotyledon and leaf size, compared with those of the controls (Figure 9A–C). Moreover, the plant height of MtGA20OX1 transgenic lines was measured. The MtGA20OX1 overexpression lines showed an increase in plant height, compared with that of the controls (Figure 9D–E). Then, we evaluated total above-ground biomass yield of 10 weeks old wild-type and MtGA20OX1 transgenic plants. The average fresh and dry weight of the MtGA20OX1 transgenic plants had a significant increase in total biomass, compared with those of wild-type (Figure 9F–G).To explore the molecular mechanism of the increasing biomass of MtGA20OX1-overexpressing plants, the expression level of cell division related genes were examined. The results showed that the transcript levels of MtCYCB1.1, MtCYCB1.2, and MtCYCD2.1 were up-regulated in MtGA20OX1-overexpressing plants (Figure 10A–C), whereas MtKRP1, MtKRP2, and MtKRP3 genes encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, were down-regulated (Figure 10D–F). These results suggest that overexpression of MtGA20OX1 might promote plant growth by controlling cell division.\\', \"ref_95:Again, fractionation was applied to fraction 4 (enriched in EPD) using normal-phase short-column vacuum chromatography (silica gel H; column dimensions 18 mm × 65 mm i.d.), eluting with stepwise solvent gradients of hexane:dichloromethane, 2:1 v/v (100 mL); hexane: dichloromethane, 1:1 v/v (2 × 50 mL); hexane:dichloromethane, 1:2 v/v (2 × 50 mL); dichloromethane (2 × 50 mL); dichloromethane: ethyl acetate 4:1 (2 × 50 mL); dichloromethane: ethyl acetate, 1:1 v/v (2 × 50 mL) to give the main chemical constituent, identified as an SL, EPD (93 mg, 90% purity by NMR and MS analyses) and containing lipids and waxes (10% by NMR analyses).A small sample of freshly dried leaves (1.63 g) was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL), filtered and the dichloromethane removed under reduced pressure leaving a dark green residue (62.6 mg, yield 3.9%).

The results are presented in Table 2. The best energies of interaction with SARS-CoV-2 main protease are observed for Sumaflavone, Pentagalloylglucose, Agathisflavone, Chrysanthemin, Isoquercetin, Myrtillin, Hinokiflavone, Myricetin Sumac Phytochemicals and Artemisinin (Table 2); so, these compounds could have more inhibitory potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease than the other studied compounds. The inhibition of this protein will induce the inhibition of viral replication; these results show that these molecules could be interesting in the clinical management of COVID-19.The Lipinski\\'s rule including molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds, number of hydrogen bonds acceptor, number hydrogen bonds donor and logP were shown in Table 3. All compounds respect the conditions mentioned in Lipinski\\'s rule, except compounds Agathisflavone, Chrysanthemin, Myrtillin and Isoquercetin with two Lipinski violations, and Sumaflavone and Pentagalloylglucose with three Lipinski violations. The ADMET prediction was used in this study to calculate the pharmacokinetics parameters of others studied compounds that respect the conditions mentioned in Lipinski\\'s rule (Table 4, Table 5). BBB: in vivo blood-brain barrier penetration (C.brain/C.blood), Buffer_solubility: Water solubility in buffer system (SK atomic types, mg/L), HIA: Human intestinal absorption (HIA, %); Pgp_inhibition: in vitro P-glecoprotein inhibition, SK logD in pH 7.4 (SK atomic types), SK logP (SK atomic types). All selected molecules have low BBB, except the molecule β-Caryophyllen. The two molecules Camphor and β-Caryophyllen are completely absorbed; the other molecules have different and acceptable absorption percentages between 69% and 96%. For metabolism, all these molecules could be inhibitors for the cytochromes CYP450_3A4 and CYP450_2C9 except the molecule Protocatechuic acid, all the studied compounds could inhibit CYP_2d6. Additionally, the other pharmacokinetics parameters such as human intestinal absorption (HIA) and water solubility (log mol/L) are all acceptable (Table 4).Examination of the preADMET toxicity screening results for the selected compounds are shown in Table 5. The results revealed that Hinokiflavone, Butein and β-caryophyllene showed negative AMES mutagenicity to all salmonella strains. Kaempferol, Myricetin, Artemisinin and Camphor showed positive AMES mutagenicity to only one of salmonella strains. Gallic acid and Protocatechuic acid are a mutagen for both TA100_NA and TA1535_10RLI strains. Methyl gallate showed positive AMES mutagenicity to three salmonella strains. Moreover, Gallic acid, Methyl gallate, Protocatechuic acid and Camphor showed the highest toxicity against algae, daphnia, and fish. Additionally, all selected compounds showed positive carcinogenicity for either rat, and negative carcinogenicity for mice. Also, all of them have a low or medium risk for hERG_ inhibition (Table 5). From these results, we can conclude that Hinokiflavone, Myricetin and Artemisinin are the structures with best affinity in the binding site of the studied enzyme and all of them respect the conditions mentioned in Lipinski\\'s rule and have acceptable ADMET proprieties; so, these compounds could have more potent antiviral treatment of COVID-19 than the studied compounds, and they have important pharmacokinetic properties and bioavailability.50 snapshots of Hinokiflavone taken at every 2ns during 100ns of simulation time.

Although Myricetin exhibits higher average number of H-bonds with protein, the bonds are not consistent. Missing h-bonds during 19–24ns indicate that Myricetin has left the binding pocket. On the other hand, Hinokiflavone exhibits consistent h-bonds with protein and remains in bound form, conformations are however changed. Fig. 12 shows Total number of hydrogen bonds formed within protein during 100ns of simulation time.

Cation-π interaction3,4 between positively charged metal and ammonium ions and aromatic amino acid side chains is well recognized as an important contributor to binding in proteins. Experimental studies have provided quantitative evidence concerning such interactions,5,6 and recent computational analyses7 have provided further quantitative data concerning the cation-π interactions of these types of cations. But for carbocations, which exist only fleetingly during enzyme-catalyzed reactions, it has not been possible to obtain similar quantitative experimental information about their cation-π interactions. A number of X-ray structural studies of enzymes that catalyze formation of polyisoprenoid natural products show aromatic amino acids in positions suggesting roles in stabilizing carbocation intermediates.1 And site-directed mutagenesis experiments have provided evidence that carbocation-π interactions do indeed play a role in the mechanisms of terpene cyclases.8-10 Building on the early theoretical work of Jenson and Jorgensen11 on interactions of carbocations putatively intermediate in steroid biosynthesis with models for aromatic amino acids, Tantillo and coworkers12-14 have conducted extensive computational investigations of the numerous complex rearrangements of carbocation intermediates in terpenoid biochemistry. In particular, Hong and Tantillo13,14 have elucidated the important roles that intermolecular C–H---π interactions may play in the biosynthesis of complex terpene natural products, using benzene to represent the aromatic residues often found in the active sites of terpene synthases.15 Our efforts in this area have included a computational study of the complexation of the methyl cation with benzene, <sup>16</sup> which provided support for the idea that carbocation-π interaction should be stronger for both η<sup>2</sup> and η<sup>1</sup> complexes over the periphery of an aromatic system, as opposed to the cation-π interactions of ammonium and metal ions, which form η<sup>6</sup> complex with aromatic rings. 4 We have also described a computational study of the carbocation-π interaction of the 1,1-dimethylallyl cation with benzene17 in which a complex of benzene bound to both ends of the 1,1-dimethylallyl cation π system was located on the potential energy surface and was found to be more stable than the related σ complex, possibly affording insight into why biological reactions involving this type of carbocation do not lead to electrophilic substitution of aromatic rings in proteins. Recently we have adopted a new strategy, in which we use X-ray structures of enzyme active sites binding a carbocation surrogate as a basis for our analysis. This approach has the distinct advantage that our calculated stabilization energies are based on experimental measurements of active site separations of aromatic amino acids from putative carbocations. This use of such X-ray measurements of the geometric relationship of an amino acid π donor to a putative carbocation presumably can give a more realistic approximation of the actual geometry that evolved to produce an effective active site than is afforded by alternate approaches used to study carbocation-π interactions. However, because X-ray structures very rarely show the positions of hydrogen atoms, this approach does not allow an assessment of the role of C–H!π interactions.Tabulations of all such measurements made on the three X-ray structures considered in detail and on the model structures constructed to replicate the portion of their active sites comprising putative carbocation-π interactions are provided in the ESI.\\', \\'ref_98:In this study, tri4 and tri11 deletion mutants were generated to evaluate the roles of tri4 and tri11 in trichodermin biosynthesis. Tatri4 catalyzes the addition of oxygen at C-2, C-12, and C-11, and this process converts trichodiene to isotrichodiol in T. arundinaceum. Deletion mutant strain Δtri4 did not produce trichodermin in strain 0248, and this phenomenon was previously observed for T. arundinaceum Δtri4 mutants (Cardoza et al.; Malmierca et al.). This result suggested that tri4 is essential for trichodermin biosynthesis in T. brevicompactum. Tatri11 controls the hydroxylation at C-4, and this process converts 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (EPT) to trichodermol in T. arundinaceum. Deletion mutant strain Δtri11 also did not biosynthesize trichodermin in T. brevicompactum 0248. Thus, these results first proved the necessity of tri11 for trichodermin biosynthesis in T. brevicompactum.In T. arundinaceum, Tri3 is hypothesized to acetylate oxygen at C-4 of the trichothecene skeleton based on the amino acid sequence and motif, HXXXDG, which is indicative of acetyl-transferases (Murray and Shaw). However, the function of tri3 in Trichoderma has not been verified yet. In our study, Δtri3 deletion mutant strain was obtained. The trichodermin in Δtri3 cultures was detected using GC, and the results showed lower concentration in the Δtri3 deletion mutant than in the wild type. As expected, the tri3 gene was involved in the biosynthesis of trichodermin by T. brevicompactum. Furthermore, high abundance of trichodermol in the Δtri3 strain was detected, contrary to the quite low trichodermol content in the wild-type culture extracts. These results demonstrated that deletion of tri3 gene in T. brevicompactum 0248 reduced the trichodermin content and accumulated trichodermol. Thus, tri3 gene was responsible for the acetyl moiety to the C-4 oxygen in T. brevicompactum. Small amount of trichodermin was still detected in the Δtri3 mutants. This phenomenon was also observed for deletion mutants of Fusarium sporotrichioides (McCormick et al.; Garvey et al.). Trace amounts of trichothecene T-2 toxin were detected in tri3 mutants of F. sporotrichioides (McCormick et al.). The small amount of trichodermin suggested the presence of another acetyl-transferase that can convert trichodermol into trichodermin but with lower efficiency. This result implied that an unidentified enzyme analogous to the tri3 acetylase from T. brevicompactum strain was probably responsible for the catalysis of the C-4 hydroxyl group of trichodermol. Many unigenes homologous to the acyltransferase-encoding genes were found in our previous transcriptome analysis of T. brevicompactum 0248 (Shentu et al.). In summary, our results indicated that tri3 gene was responsible for the last step of the acetylation of the C-4 oxygen in T. brevicompactum.Interestingly, QRT-PCR analyses showed that before 52 h cultivation, the loss of function of tri3, tri4, or tri11 led to the upregulation of the tri genes. These results were in agreement with the feedback regulation mechanism. To our knowledge, the end-product and intermediate metabolites play a significant role in the regulation of metabolic pathways by directly or indirectly regulating the genes involved in metabolic pathways (Goelzer et al.; Herrgard et al.). Previous studies showed that the synthesis of trichodermin was mainly concentrated during the incubation period of 40–60 h (Yuan et al.). Therefore, the lower yield of trichodermin in Δtri3 mutant or intermediate metabolites in Δtri4 and Δtri11 mutants may serve as a signal to trigger the feedback regulation. Thus, the expression of tri genes was upregulated, and synthesis of enzymes was induced.\\', \\'ref_99:The topic is Molecular mechanisms of bioactive constituent accumulation in licorice under salt stress. Previous studies have provided evidence indicating that suitable environmental stress such as salinity and drought would increase the accumulation of glycyrrhizin and several flavonoids. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of these constituents have not been clarified, which seriously hinders the extensive and effective application of licorice and the cultivation of high-quality plants. In this work, we cultivated licorice seedlings in a simulated salt environment treated with 50 mM NaCl and then performed an integrated transcriptomic and metabolite profiling analysis. The metabolite analysis identified 121 chemicals consisting of 83 flavonoids, 14 triterpenoids, 22 coumarin, and 2 others, among which flavonoids and triterpenoids showed the highest chemical proportion and primarily contributed to the bioactive benefits of licorice. Therefore, we chose these two types of compounds for correlation experiments in the further transcriptomic study.Flavonoids have properties such as the typical reactive oxygen species scavenging, which highlights their significance under stress conditions. Furthermore, various stress conditions have also been shown to alter the expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes. DEGs are involved in the synthesis of flavonoids from steps involving the formation of chemical scaffolds to subsequent modifications. Enzymes involved early in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway include PAL, CHS, and CHI. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis begins with the PAL gene, an important factor for development and resistance to abiotic stresses in plants that catalyzes L-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid. Previous studies suggested that mutant PALs can influence the phenolic content in plants. The involvement of CHS has been well documented in fruit quality, regulation of flower color, response to environmental stress, and most importantly, in the production and accumulation of flavonoids in plants. Overexpression or inactivation of the CHI gene has been shown to lead to a remarkable change in flavonoid content. These biosynthetic genes and the late pathway enzymes including F3H, FLS, C4H, and 4CL were significantly upregulated after salt treatment. Furthermore, the corresponding glycosides of the flavonoids including chalcone, flavone, flavanone, and isoflavone glycosides exhibited similar expression patterns to those of the DEGs (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 4).Similar to flavonoids, triterpenoid saponins also facilitate the adaptation of plants to UV-B and drought or salt-stress conditions. The triterpenoid saponins in licorice are mainly glycyrrhizic acid-related derivatives of the oleanane type, starting from the mevalonic acid pathway of the terpene backbone. The results showed that DEGs of structural triterpenoids including HMGR, GGPS, FDLT1, SQLE, and bAS was remarkably upregulated. Furthermore, in the salt-stressed group, the expression levels of CYP DEGs, which are postmodification enzymes of triterpenoids, were consistent with those of the structural DEGs. The contents of most terpenoids were higher in the salt-stressed group than they were in the control group. Moreover, the terpenoid compounds possessed one to three glycosyl groups except for glycyrrhetinic and glabric acid, which suggests that postmodification glycosyltransferase may be involved in triterpenoid saponin synthesis and contribute to the diversity of triterpenoids in licorice.The results of this study imply that glycosyltransferase might be crucial in the downstream modification of flavonoids and triterpenoids, leading to an increase in liquiritin, isoliquiritin, neoliquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside, and other flavonoid glycosides. The compounds identified in this analysis have been proven to possess diverse bioactivities and mediate the pharmacological activity of licorice. In addition, our findings explain the inconsistency of the overexpression of upstream genes and the evident decrease in flavonoid precursors.\\', \\'ref_100:Furthermore, AO and EB double staining was performed in the U87 cells to observe cell apoptosis, using a fluorescence microscope. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, living cells (control) had large green nuclei, demonstrating that their cell membranes remained undamaged. However, upon treatment with 10, 50 or 150 µM taraxerol acetate, the number of cells with large green nuclei markedly reduced (Fig. 3B–D). At a concentration of 150 µM taraxerol acetate, nearly all cells demonstrated signs of nuclear condensation and apoptotic body formation (Fig. 3D). U87 cells were treated with 0, 10, 50 and 150 µM taraxerol acetate for 48 h, and the Annexin V-FITC/PI staining was used to detect apoptosis. Compared with the untreated control cells (Fig. 4A), taraxerol acetate induced early and late apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B–D). The quadrants Q1-4 represent necrotic, late apoptotic, viable and early apoptotic cells, respectively. The percentage of the apoptotic cells increased from 7.3% in the control cells (Fig. 4A) to 16.1, 44.1 and 76.7% in the 10 (Fig. 4B), 50 (Fig. 4C) and 150 µM (Fig. 4D) taraxerol acetate-treated cells, respectively. To investigate whether taraxerol acetate induces cell cycle disorders in U87 cells, flow cytometry analysis with PI as a staining agent was conducted subsequent to taraxerol acetate treatment. The results demonstrated that the cell cycle distribution changed with the increasing doses of taraxerol acetate (Fig. 5). The percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase increased gradually from 2.4% in the untreated control to 18.6, 33.21 and 48.6% following 10, 50 and 150 µM taraxerol acetate treatment, respectively (Fig. 5). The percentage of cells in the S-phase decreased from 33.15% in untreated cells to 27.21, 16.21 and 12.9% following 10, 50 and 150 µM taraxerol acetate treatment, respectively (Fig. 5). In addition, taraxerol acetate treatment induced dose-dependent DNA fragmentation ladders in U87 cells. This DNA fragmentation is a hallmark of apoptosis (Fig. 6).The effect of taraxerol acetate on the migration of U87 cells was assessed using an in vitro wound healing assay. The confluent cells were scratched and then subjected to taraxerol acetate treatment for 48 h. An image was captured and the percentage of cells that had migrated into the scratched area was calculated. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, taraxerol acetate led to a marked and dose-dependent reduction in the number of cells migrating into the scratched area. Taraxerol acetate was demonstrated to lead to an increase in the population of sub-G1 U87 cells, thus the cell cycle-regulating proteins affected by taraxerol acetate were investigated. The effect of taraxerol acetate on various cell cycle-associated proteins, including p21, cyclin B and D, CDK2, 4 and 6, was determined with western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that administration of taraxerol acetate increased the protein expression levels of the CDK inhibitor, p21 in a dose-dependent manner, compared with the control group (Fig. 8). In addition, reduced protein expression levels of cyclin B, cyclin D, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 were demonstrated in the taraxerol acetate-treated cells compared with the relative untreated control cells (Fig. 8).In addition to apoptotic cell death, taraxerol acetate induced autophagic cell death in the U87 cells. Administration of taraxerol acetate led to increased protein expression levels of LC3B-II when compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 9). The LC3B-II protein is located on the membranes of autophagosomes, which is triggered upon treatment with taraxerol acetate. The protein expression levels of LC3B-II increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9). In addition, the protein expression levels of LC3B-II demonstrated a time-dependence, as the expression levels increased with the increasing time intervals between 3 and 24 h (Fig. 9). In vitro experiments identified taraxerol acetate to be a potent cytotoxic agent, which inhibits cell proliferation, and induces apoptosis and autophagy. To determine whether taraxerol acetate induces similar anticancer effects in vivo, nude mice were treated with taraxerol acetate. Cancer was induced in the mice by injection of U87 cancer cells (1×105 cells/mouse). Following tumor generation, the mice were treated with 0.25 and 0.75 µg/g taraxerol acetate and sacrificed. Tumors were removed, and their weight and volume were measured (Fig. 10). The results demonstrate that 0.25 and 0.75 µg/g taraxerol acetate treatment reduced the tumor weight from 1.2 g in the PBS-treated group (control) to 0.81 and 0.42 g in the 0.25 and 0.75 µg/g taraxerol acetate treatment groups, respectively (Fig. 11). Similarly, 0.25 and 0.75 µg/g taraxerol acetate treatment reduced the tumor volume from 1.3 cm3 in the PBS-treated group (control) to 0.67 and 0.25 cm3, respectively (Fig. 12).\\', \\'ref_101:The pCold-TF/CcTPS1 plasmid was transformed into E. coli expression strain Rosetta (DE3), and the clones were screened in an LB solid plate containing AMP (100 mg/l) and CM (34 mg/l)... Affinity purification was carried out using Ni-NTA agarose columns (QIAGEN), and the recombinant protein was purified with elution buffers containing 10, 20, and 250 mM imidazole... For the in vitro enzyme activity assays, purified CcTPS1 recombinant protein was added to the reaction buffer with a final volume of 250 ml containing 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10 mg GDP, FDP, or GGDP, then incubated at 30-C for 3 h... GC–MS analysis of the reaction products was performed as described earlier.To identify the structures of the CcTPS1 enzymatic products, 150 l of engineered E. coli cells harboring pCold-TF/CcTPS1, pET28a/MmGFDPS, and pBbA5c-MevT-MBIS were cultivated... The crude extract was subjected to CC on silica gel eluted with PE and then with PE/ethyl acetate in a stepwise-gradient system (from 100:0 to 1:1, v/v) to obtain five fractions (Fr.1–Fr.5)... GC–MS analysis was used to confirm the structures of the isolated compounds.The cDNA of CcTPS1 and AtGFDPS2 (At3g14550) were amplified and subcloned into the Cowpea mosaic virus-based (CPMV-HT) plant expression vector pEAQ-HT... For subcellular localization analysis, the full-length cDNA of CcTPS1 was ligated into the pCAMBIA1300-GFP vector... Three days after infiltration, the transgenic tobacco leaves were observed and imaged under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus).Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR amplification using pCold-TF/CcTPS1 as the template and the mutated complementary sequences as primers... The amino acid sequences of plant TPSs were obtained from the NCBI protein database and aligned using the Clustal X program. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA X software.\\', \\'ref_102:Among the various IDTs, paspalitrems are most similar to and constitute the structural isomers of the aflatrems that are produced by Aspergillus flavus (Cole et al.; Gallagher and Wilson). Thus, normal prenylation of the indole moiety of paspalinine (3) at the C21 and C20 positions yields the 2-methylbut-2-ene side chain in paspalitrems A and C, respectively (4 and 5, Fig. 1). For aflatrems, reverse prenylation of paspalinine at the same positions affords the 3-methylbut-1-ene side chains of β-aflatrem and aflatrem A, respectively. IdtF of C. paspali is a predicted prenyltransferase with 21% identity over 78% of the amino acid sequence to AtmP encoded in the aflatrem gene cluster of A. flavus that is responsible for the reverse prenylation of paspalinine (3) (Liu et al.). IdtF shows similar levels of identities to PtmD and PenD (both 21% over 95% coverage at the amino acid level), normal prenyltransferases that modify β-paxitriol during penitrem production in Penicillium strains (Oikawa et al.). We proposed that IdtF in C. paspali is responsible for the normal prenylation of paspalinine (3) at the C21 or C20 positions to afford paspalitrem A or C (4 or 5), respectively (Kozák et al.). In agreement with this, the ∆idtF knockout strain of C. paspali was unable to produce prenyl-elaborated IDTs, and accumulated paspalinine (3) with minor amounts of paspaline (1) also detectable. This result clearly validates the predicted function of IdtF as a paspaline C20 or C21 normal prenyltransferase. This also indicates that normal prenylation of paspalinine (3) (as with IdtF) vs. reverse prenylation of the same substrate (as with AtmD) demanded the parallel evolution of non-orthologous prenyltransferases despite the identical substrate. On the other hand, normal prenyltransferases such as IdtF vs. PtmD or PenD are also highly divergent, reflecting the different substrates (paspalinine 3 vs. β-paxitriol).Purified AtmD from A. flavus and PaxD from P. paxilli were reported to accept paspaline (1) as an alternative substrate in vitro and catalyze the formation of paspaline derivatives α-prenylated at the C21 or C22 positions (Fig. 1) (Liu et al.). Since the C. paspali ∆idtP strain accumulates paspaline (1) and has an intact copy of the idtF gene, we considered that the prenyltransferase IdtF may also be able to produce prenylated paspaline derivatives. We also considered the possibility that the prenyltransferase DmaW from the ergot alkaloid biosynthetic gene cluster of C. paspali (27.4% identity over 92% coverage at the amino acid level to AtmD) may engage in metabolic crosstalk to produce prenylated paspaline derivatives. However, no metabolites could be detected with the calculated m/z of monoprenyl-paspaline or hydroxyprenyl-paspaline in the fermentation extracts of the wild type or the ∆idtP strains. This result indicates that at least in vivo, neither IdtF nor DmaW would accept paspaline (1) as a substrate, although just as with AtmD and PaxD, purified IdtF or DmaW may catalyze paspaline monoprenylation with a low efficiency in vitro. Uhlig and coworkers (Uhlig et al.) showed that in addition to the expected biosynthetic intermediates of paspalitrem biosynthesis, field samples of C. paspali (such as the C. paspali-P. dilatatum association) also produce a number of compounds with the paspaline or paspalitrem scaffold. Thus, we investigated the presence of such analogues in axenic cultures of C. paspali DSM833 and its ∆idtP and ∆idtF knockout strains. However, none of these analogues (SI Supplementary Table S2) was detectable. This discrepancy between the IDT profiles of the field samples vs. the axenic cultures may be explained by dissimilar regulation of gene expression and/or the presence of plant-derived enzymes and the extended cultivation period in the case of field-collected samples.In this study, we demonstrated that targeted disruption of the idtP and idtF genes in C. paspali modulates the IDT product spectrum towards paspaline-type IDTs such as paspaline (1) and paspalinine (3). These results highlight the metabolic engineering potential of the A. tumefaciens-mediated C. paspali transformation system (Kozák et al.) in creating efficient platforms for the production of the IDT nucleus for combinatorial biosynthesis and the large-scale production of complex IDTs for various biomedical applications in the future (Kozák et al.).\\', \\'ref_103:Based on the plant CYP HMM model, NCBI, and Interpro annotations, 346 CYPs in Andrographis paniculata were identified. These were analyzed alongside 92 terrestrial plant diterpenoid pathway CYPs (excluding gymnosperm-specific subfamilies) and 230 Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CYPs, totaling 668 proteins, for phylogenetic relationships (Table S1). The MUSCLE alignment excluded two excessively short proteins (IDs in 4.2.), leaving 666 proteins for further analysis. Their conserved sequences were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. According to Figure 1 and Table 1, the 666 CYPs clustered into 50 subfamilies. Among these, 328 CYPs from Andrographis paniculata were assigned to 42 known subfamilies. The remaining 17 CYPs did not cluster into any recognized subfamily and were annotated as ‘CYP family’. Subfamilies CYP702 and CYP708 are unique to Arabidopsis, while subfamilies CYP736 and CYP749 contain only Andrographis paniculata CYPs. Diterpenoid pathway CYPs originated from the CYP71 family’s CYP71, CYP76, CYP99, and CYP701A subfamilies, the CYP72 family’s CYP714 subfamily, and the CYP85 family’s CYP88A subfamily. The CYP99 subfamily has been identified only in monocots. In the dicot Andrographis paniculata, six CYPs were annotated as CYP99 but clustered within the CYP71 subfamily. These CYPs were reassigned to the CYP71 subfamily (Figure 1 and Table S2). A total of 70 Andrographis paniculata CYPs that clustered with terrestrial plant diterpenoid pathway CYPs (marked in the red clade in Figure 1) were selected as candidates. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 70 candidate CYPs from Andrographis paniculata alongside 92 terrestrial plant diterpenoid pathway CYPs using full-length protein sequences (Figure 2). XP_051128741 did not cluster with any subfamily and was excluded. XP_051150854 clustered with the CYP76AH, CYP76AK, and CYP76BK subfamilies, which are specifically expanded in the Lamiaceae of Lamiales. This suggested that these subfamilies might have a catalytic function unique to Lamiales rather than being restricted to Lamiaceae. Plant CYPs typically contain the I-helix, K-helix, and a critical domain near the C-terminus, FXXGXRXCXG. In Andrographis paniculata, all 345 identified CYPs contained the I-helix and K-helix, but some lacked the complete FXXGXRXCXG. Based on the FXXGXRXCXG motif, 22 sequences were excluded (IDs: XP_051123363, XP_051127248, XP_051128741, XP_051133618, XP_051136989, XP_051140631, XP_051152697, XP_051123609, XP_051125649, XP_051126314, XP_051150718, XP_051131936, XP_051131945, XP_051133611, XP_051137552, XP_051141267, XP_051141281, XP_051146792, XP_051147073, XP_051149418, XP_051149781, and XP_051150050), leaving 323 high-confidence CYPs (Figure 3). Thus, the 70 candidate diterpenoid pathway CYPs were reduced to 65.Based on database annotations and phylogenetic classification, the symbols of 65 candidate diterpenoid pathway CYPs were revised (Table S2). Except for XP_051133612 (267 amino acids, aa) and XP_051136915 (620 aa), the lengths of the remaining 63 candidate CYPs were evenly distributed around 500 aa, with an average length of 503 aa. The two members of the CYP88A subfamily, four members of the CYP714 subfamily, and three members of the CYP76 subfamily were localized to the chloroplasts. The sole member of the CYP701A subfamily, XP_051135400 (KO), was localized to the plasma membrane. Of the 55 CYP71 subfamily members, 48 were localized to the chloroplasts. XP_051121925, XP_051133624, and XP_051121134 were localized to the plasma membrane. XP_051126315 and XP_051133729 were found in the vacuolar membrane, while XP_051133853 and XP_051133854 are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicated that the 65 candidate CYPs primarily catalyze products of the MEP pathway. A total of 50 candidate CYPs were transmembrane proteins, with 47 CYPs having a transmembrane domain within the first 30 aa. The remaining three candidate CYPs had two transmembrane domains. However, 57 candidate CYPs lacked signal peptides, while the remaining eight were predicted to have signal peptide sequences with a probability of only 51–69%. Motif distribution within candidate CYPs was subfamily-specific, elucidating systematic evolutionary relationships (Figure 4). CYPs in the three GA pathway subfamilies exhibited fewer motifs compared to those in the CYP76 and CYP71 subfamilies. The CYP714 subfamily contained only motifs 4 and 6. The CYP88A subfamily included motifs 2, 4, 6, and 7. The CYP701A subfamily had an additional motif 5 compared to CYP88A. The CYP76 subfamily conservatively included motifs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Within the CYP71 subfamily, all members, except for the significantly truncated XP_051133612, consistently contained motifs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10. Cis-acting elements in promoters determine the biological function of genes. According to Figure 4 and Table 2, GA-responsive elements were not limited to CYP88A, CYP701A, and CYP714 subfamilies; CYPs in the CYP76 and CYP71 subfamilies could also respond to the GA pathway. Additionally, candidate CYPs generally responded to abscisic acid (ABA) and anaerobic induction. ABA is involved in stress response, while anaerobic induction is associated with flooding damage. Except for one CYP in the CYP701A subfamily, all other subfamilies had CYPs participating in auxin signaling and environmental stresses such as LT. MeJA, related to damage, induces chemical defense. In addition to two CYPs in the CYP88A subfamily, the other four subfamilies included 49 candidate CYPs with promoters containing MeJA-responsive elements. Two CYP71 subfamily CYPs (protein IDs: XP_051121134 and XP_051133624) had the highest number of MeJA-responsive elements, each with seven. Another two CYP71 subfamily candidate CYPs (protein IDs: XP_051133617 and XP_051146596) had promoters containing flavonoid biosynthesis elements. Research on wheat indicates that gene function is determined not only by exons and non-coding regions but also by introns, which significantly affect protein efficacy. Our structural analysis showed that one candidate CYP in the CYP71 subfamily (protein ID: XP_051152769) contained an unusually long intron of 40,751 bp. According to Table S3, this long intron included multiple functionally decisive cis-acting elements involved in responses to light, LT, GA signaling, dehydration, and phosphate starvation. The lengths of other candidate CYPs were all within 10,000 bp. The promoter is divided into core, proximal, and distal regions. The core promoter contains the transcriptional start site (TSS), while the proximal promoter is located near the TSS. Both are primary binding areas for specific transcription factors (TFs). Conversely, the influence of TFs bound to the distal promoter is relatively weaker. In this study, the region located at the upstream one-third of the promoter from the start codon was designated as the core and proximal promoter. We selected 10 representative candidate CYPs from each subfamily whose cis-acting elements were predominantly located within the core and proximal promoters. These were marked by white circles in Figure 4. The protein IDs of the 10 representative candidate CYPs were as follows: XP_051121709, XP_051151156, and XP_051151369 of the CYP714 subfamily; XP_051123242 and XP_051144151 of the CYP88A subfamily; XP_051135400 of the CYP701A subfamily; XP_051150854 of the CYP76 subfamily; and XP_051136915 (CYP71B), XP_051137327 (CYP71D), and XP_051133994 (CYP99) of the CYP71 subfamily. The spatial structures of representative candidate CYPs in the GA pathway subfamilies were relatively conserved. Within the CYP71 subfamily, structural discrepancies existed between CYP71D and the other three members, indicating functional specificity (Figure 5).Andrographolide accumulated in the leaves (Figure 6A). Under LT conditions, the leaves of Andrographis paniculata turned red, with andrographolide content significantly decreasing (Figure 6B). To investigate the LT response of representative CYPs, Andrographis paniculata seedlings were subjected to different LT treatments: room temperature (green leaves, CK), mild stress (slight red leaves, SR), moderate stress (medium red leaves, MR), and severe stress (all red leaves, AR). Gene expression profiling revealed that three representative CYPs [protein IDs: XP_051123242 (KAO), XP_051135400 (KO), and XP_051137327 (CYP71D)] showed significant expression changes under LT conditions. These CYPs interacted with other differentially expressed genes (Figure 7). CYP71D had the most interacting proteins (37 proteins). Among them, 35 were CYPs (highlighted in yellow background), and 16 were diterpenoid pathway CYPs (marked with red circles). In the GA pathway, KAO and KO interacted with each other, and both also interacted with XP_051141106 (GA20OX2-like). Additionally, KAO and KO each independently interacted with two other GA pathway proteins (highlighted in blue background). KAO also interacted with two Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases (CYPOR-like) (Figure 7). The accumulations of KAO and KO were significantly upregulated under mild LT stress but decreased under moderate to severe LT stress (Figure 8). The LT expression pattern of KAO was opposite to that of its interacting partners, GA20OX1-like and GAox-like. Similarly, KO exhibited a negative correlation with GA2ox-like, which interacted with it under the LT condition. The LT-related expression of GA20OX2-like did not show a clear trend relative to KAO and KO. The expression of CYP71D was significantly reduced under all LT treatments, indicating it was a negative regulator of the LT response. Conversely, transcripts of 25 CYPs interacting with CYP71D accumulated under varying degrees of LT stress. These CYPs served as positive response factors at the corresponding stages.\\', \\'ref_104:PR and GR contain the typical seven transmembrane α-helical protein motif (opsin), which binds a molecule of all-trans retinal (A1) via a covalent Schiff base (SB) linkage with a buried lysine residue. Upon photoexcitation, retinal isomerizes from the all-trans to the 13-cis configuration, eliciting specific structural changes in the protein. A proton is transferred from the protonated SB to a nearby Asp (the counterion; D97 in PR, D121 in GR) and is ultimately released at the extracellular surface. Another proton is picked up from the cytoplasm to reprotonate the SB and the retinal undergoes thermal reisomerization back to the ground state. As a net effect, a proton is pumped across the cell membrane per photon absorbed, thereby generating a proton gradient. This light-driven proton motive force can be coupled to ATP synthesis, which is used to drive the growth and survival of PR-expressing host organisms under energy-limiting conditions. Both PR and GR also express readily in non-native hosts such as Escherichia coli, in contrast to BR. PR has further been shown to be able to contribute to physiological processes in E. coli such as chemotaxis and the heterologous generation of bioproducts such as biohydrogen. These features make PR and GR attractive model systems for a variety of synthetic biology applications. For instance, when expressed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, PR was observed to stimulate growth upon illumination compared with a nonfunctional PR mutant.A great challenge in many of these applications has been to extend the action spectrum into the far-red and near-infrared (NIR) range of the electromagnetic spectrum (≥700 nm), which is relatively unexplored. It has been suggested that PRs can complement oxophototrophy further when their spectral band is shifted bathochromically to utilize photons outside the range of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400–700 nm), which is hardly exploited by oxygenic photosynthesis. Red-light activation is also highly desired in the field of optogenetics, where microbial rhodopsins like channelrhodopsins are used to modulate the activity of neurons or other mammalian cells by light. Light of wavelength ≥700 nm penetrates much further into biological tissue, which for instance would be very useful for the optogenetic stimulation of deeper brain regions. One of the primary approaches to shift the action spectrum of microbial rhodopsins has been to modify the protein (opsin) environment. Several red-shifted mutants of PR and GR have been constructed using random mutagenesis screens or targeted mutagenesis of specific binding pocket residues. However, most mutants are strongly functionally impaired, which presents a major drawback. Nonetheless, a few red-shifted mutants have been identified that retain 30–50% of the pumping activity of the wild-type protein, such as the single mutant PR-T101A (PR-TA) (λmax = 536 nm) and the double mutant PR-D212N,F234S (PR-DNFS) (λmax = 540 nm). Chromophore substitution is another verified strategy to shift the absorption spectrum of these proteins. We have previously demonstrated red and blue shifts in the absorbance bands of PR, GR, and PR-DNFS using analogues of A1 with different ring modifications. Of these, the analogue all-trans-3,4-dehydroretinal (A2) induced a significant red shift (26–32 nm) in all pigments while largely retaining the pump activity. A2 is the only other naturally occurring retinal, and it has been found in the photoreceptor cells of certain fish, invertebrates, and amphibians.− It was also shown to cause a red shift in the absorbance bands of archaeal rhodopsins with a minimal effect on activity. The additional conjugation in A2 between C3 and C4 (Figure 1b) decreases the energy gap for the π–π* transition, causing the spectral shift to longer wavelengths (Tables 1 and S1 and Figure S1).In this report, we specifically focus on red-shifting retinal analogues. We elaborated the conjugation of A2 by adding different electron-withdrawing substituents at C3 in the β-ionone ring and/or at C13 or C14 in the polyene chain. Analogues modified at C13 or C14, however, showed poor reactivity or low stability of the resulting holoprotein (Ganapathy and de Grip, unpublished). Here we report on the ring-modified analogues all-trans-3-methoxy-3,4-dehydroretinal (MOA2), all-trans-3-dimethylamino-16-nor-1,2,3,4-didehydroretinal (DMAR), and all-trans-3-methylamino-16-nor-1,2,3,4-didehydroretinal (MMAR) (Figure 1). Promising analogues were combined with red-shifted mutants (Figure 2). While all of the analogues tested yielded red-shifted pigments, MMAR was finally identified as the most promising analogue from our study, inducing bathochromic shifts of up to an astonishing 200 nm while retaining activity in NIR light. MMAR pigments have broad potential for a variety of biotechnological, optogenetic, and oxyphototrophic applications.\\', \"ref_105:A preliminary analysis of chemical extracts from P. crustosum isolate PN2402 and P. janthinellum isolate PN2408 identified compounds with mass and fragmentation profiles consistent with penetremanes and janthitremanes respectively suggesting that these strains were suitable candidates for identification and characterisation of the genes responsible for indole-diterpene biosynthesis. A combination of degenerate and species-specific primers shown in Table A1 were used to amplify a variety of putative indole-diterpene cluster fragments from both species. Degenerate primers were designed to conserved regions of indole-diterpene biosynthetic genes homologous to paxC and paxP (Figure 2) after comparing homologous genes from P. paxilli, A. flavus, and E. festucae var. lolii (=Neotyphodium lolii). Species specific primers were subsequently designed based on the sequence of amplification products from degenerate PCR. Successful amplification was achieved for both species using degenerate primers conC1 and conC2 resulting in putative gene fragments that were similar to the corresponding region of the P. paxilli paxC gene. These amplification products were 529-bp for P. crustosum and 535-bp for P. janthinellum. For P. crustosum, the paxC-like fragment was extended using primers 2402F1 (specific for the conC1-conC2 product) and degenerate primer PBR2 to produce a contiguous sequence of 2020-bp, which included 813-bp that was similar to the 3\\' end of paxC, an intergenic region of 865-bp, and 342-bp that was similar to the 3\\' end of paxP from P. paxilli. For P. janthinellum a second product of 601-bp was amplified using degenerate primers PPF1 and PPR2 that was similar to a fragment of paxP from P. paxilli. These putative C and P gene PCR products were then linked using species-specific primers 2408F1 and 2408PF1 resulting in a contiguous sequence of 2025-bp for the three overlapping amplification products which included 829-bp that was similar to the 3′ end of paxC, an intergenic region of 392-bp and 804-bp that was similar to the 3′ end of the paxP-like gene.For P. crustosum, 23 predicted open reading frames were identified within the contiguous sequence and designated PC-01 to PC-23 (Figure 2a, Table 1). Nine of these were putative orthologs of genes in the PAX cluster. All seven of the genes that are necessary for paxilline biosynthesis in P. paxilli [paxG (geranygeranyl diphosphate synthase), paxA (integral membrane protein), paxM (FAD-dependent monooxygenase), paxB (integral membrane protein) paxC (prenyl transferase) paxP (cytochrome P450 monooxygenase) and paxQ (cytochrome P450 monooxygenase)], had homologs in the PEN cluster plus homologs of two genes [paxD (aromatic prenyl transferase) and paxO (oxidoreductase)] that have demonstrated or possible functions in paxilline modification. These genes were tandemly arranged in the cluster from PC-07 to PC-13 and PC-18 to PC-19, interrupted by genes PC-14 to PC-17. These four genes are predicted to encode a putative dimethylaniline monooxygenase (PC-14), an oxidoreductase/short chain dehydrogenase (PC-15), an acetyl transferase (PC-16), and an MFS transporter (PC-17). The pen genes were flanked by genes predicted to encode a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase similar to a gene for gibberellin biosynthesis in F. fujikuroi (PC-05) and a Nmr-A family transcriptional regulator (PC-06) at one flank and two cytochrome P450s (PC-20 and PC-21) and an aromatic prenyl transferase (PC-22) at the other. For P. janthinellum, 22 predicted open reading frames were identified and designated PJ-01 to PJ-22 (Figure 2b, Table 2). The JAN cluster also contained homologs of the nine pax genes with identical syntenic organization compared with the PAX cluster from PJ-07 to PJ-16, except that these genes were interrupted by a single gene encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (PJ-13) that does not have a homolog in any other indole-diterpene gene cluster characterized to date. The jan genes were flanked by genes predicted to encode a ubiquitin protein ligase and a β-glucosidase (PJ-05 and PJ-06) at one flank, and a hypothetical protein and an alcohol dehydrogenase (PJ-17 and PJ-18) at the other. Identities with Pax proteins ranged from 31% to 75% for P. crustosum and 42% to 77% for P. janthinellum. All of the pen and jan genes were predicted to contain multiple exons as shown in Table 1 and Table 2 and displayed a high level of structural conservation compared with the pax genes in terms of the positions of introns within their coding sequences. Exceptions to this were for penM, which had one additional intron compared with paxM, and penQ which had one less intron than paxQ. Barring these exceptions, of 27 introns identified in the nine pax genes of P. paxilli, equivalent introns were identified in the same relative positions in the respective pen and jan gene homologs of P. crustosum and P. janthinellum.\", \\'ref_106:In a screening of 82 mutants of Gtf180-ΔN, mutant Q1140E was selected for further studies and compared to wild-type Gtf180-ΔN. At optimal conditions, mutant Q1140E achieved ~95% RebA conversion into mainly mono-α-glucosylated RebA product RebA-G1 (Fig. 3), compared to only 55% conversion by the wild-type enzyme. Under batch conditions, a high product yield of 115 g/L RebA-G (79 mM) was obtained within 3 h (from 84 mM RebA), applying only 5 U/mL of the Q1140E mutant enzyme. The product yield could even be enhanced to 270 g/L RebA-G (188 mM) (from 200 mM RebA) by adopting a fed-batch reaction with stepwise addition of sucrose. This reduced availability of sucrose effectively suppressed the formation of α-gluco-oligo/polysaccharides. Instead, sucrose was mainly used as donor substrate for RebA glucosylation by the Q1140E enzyme, yielding more RebA α-glucosides. The Gtf180-ΔN-Q1140E mutant glucosylated RebA specifically at the steviol C-19 position, introducing a Glc(α1→6) residue at the ester-linked Glc(β1→ residue. This finding is in line with the present knowledge about the wild-type Gtf180-ΔN enzyme, which also specifically elongates the C-19 glucose residue with mainly alternating (α1→6)- and (α1→3)-linked glucose units. In contrast to the modified steviol glycosides prepared by incubation with CGTases, thereby introducing only (α1→4)-linked glucose residues, the (α1→3) and (α1→6) linkages are resistant to hydrolysis by the human amylolytic enzymes in saliva, which may prolong the sweet taste in the mouth.Molecular docking studies were performed to gain insight into the glucosylation mechanism of RebA at the molecular level and to elucidate how a single amino acid change in Gtf180-ΔN, namely Q1140E, significantly improved RebA conversion. Docking of RebA into the active site of the Gtf180-ΔN wild-type enzyme indicated that only its steviol C-19-ester-linked Glc(β1→ residue is available for glucosylation. The Q1140E mutation is predicted not to affect the orientation and position of RebA in the active site, supporting the experimental observation that both enzymes specifically α-glucosylate RebA at the Glc1(β1→C-19 residue, and not at the Glc3(β1→2)[Glc4(β1→3)]Glc2(β1→C-13 trisaccharide (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the docking results showed that Glc1 HO-6 and not Glc1 HO-3 of the Glc1(β1→C-19 residue of RebA is prominently available for glucosylation. This is in agreement with the experimental results that both wild-type and mutant Gtf180-ΔN enzymes attach the first Glc residue (Glc5) exclusively via an (α1→6)-linkage. A faster and more efficient glucosylation of RebA was obtained by replacement of glutamine with the more negatively charged glutamate at position 1140 (mutant Q1140E). Conceivably, deprotonation of Glc1 HO-6 is aided by a water-mediated hydrogen bond between Glc1 HO-6 and glutamate, which is absent with glutamine at position 1140 (Fig. 6). The finding that Q1140E shows mostly mono-glucosylation is currently difficult to explain on basis of the docking results. Elucidation of the Q1140E mutant protein 3D structure, followed by a comparison of the Gtf180-ΔN wild-type and mutant Q1140E structures, ideally in complex with RebA, may shed more light on the observed differences in RebA glucosylation.An important finding in our study was that the multi-glucosylated RebA product, RebA-G, had a significantly reduced bitterness compared to RebA. This improved steviol glycoside product mixture thus displays appealing sensory properties and is likely to find application as a functional food ingredient. This study also shows that Gtf180-ΔN-Q1140E is a very efficient catalyst for α-glucosylation of steviol glycosides.\\', \\'ref_107:A recent in vitro study demonstrated that ferroptosis, mediated by SLC7A11/GPX4 inactivation, was involved in the pathogenesis of TP-induced cardiotoxicity (Liu et al.). Hao QQ et al. also reported that 90 μg/kg/d dose of TP intervention for 28 days could cause ferroptosis of mouse oocytes (Hao et al.). In view of the mounting evidence underscoring the involvement of ferroptosis in organ injury (Yamada et al.), we are interested in exploring its potential role in TP-induced hepatotoxicity. In this research, we utilized various methodologies to evaluate multiple indicators associated with ferroptosis, clarifying the influences of TP on iron, lipid, and GSH metabolism in hepatocytes. Our findings substantiate the crucial role of ferroptosis in TP-induced liver damage. Iron-overload is necessary for lipid peroxide accumulation and the initiation of ferroptosis. Excess free iron result in ferroptosis by triggering a Fenton reaction, which generates ROS that promote PUFAs to peroxide (He et al.). Normally, Fe3+ binds to transferrin, is transported to tissues through the bloodstream, enters cells via TFR1-facilitated endocytosis, and is then converted to Fe2+ through the metal reductase STEAP3. Iron in the cytoplasm that is unused or excreted is stored in ferritin. FTH1 is the main subunit of ferritin with an iron oxidase active center that can oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+, enabling iron to be retained as a more stable state within ferritin. When FTH1 is degraded, levels of free Fe2+ increase. Fe2+ is prone to undergo Fenton reaction with H2O2, producing hydroxyl free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins and lipids, and promote lipid peroxidation (Fang et al.). TFR1 is responsible for cellular iron uptake, and its increased expression can facilitate ferroptosis (Tang et al.). And FPN exports iron from cells to maintain iron homeostasis. Decreased expression of FPN is also an important factor leading to intracellular iron overload and ferroptosis (Bao et al.; Li et al.). In this research, we observed increased iron content following TP treatment, which were effectively reversed by the administration of Fer-1. Molecularly, TP significantly reduced FTH1 protein levels and FPN mRNA levels while increasing TFR1 mRNA levels. Our results indicated that TP caused iron overload in hepatocytes by degrading ferritin and increasing iron intake.Lipid metabolism affects cellular homeostasis by regulating energy balance, membrane integrity, and signaling pathways. Alterations in lipid profiles can significantly influence cellular vulnerability to ferroptosis. The PUFAs, particularly AA and AdA, in membrane phospholipids are sensitive to lipid peroxidation and are associated with ferroptosis (Kim et al.). In this research, we assessed lipid profiles through lipidomics to provide insights into the mechanisms of TP leading to ferroptosis and liver injury. However, the identification of oxidized lipids is challenging (Tyurina et al.). To compensate for this limitation, we further assessed the expression of key factors regulating lipid metabolism in AML12 cells after TP treatment. In lipid metabolism, ACSL4 catalyzes the conversion of PUFAs, particularly AA and AdA, into Acyl-CoA. This is a critical step in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. Acyl-CoA is inserted into the phospholipids of the plasma membrane by LPCAT. ALOX facilitates the oxidation of fatty acids (Doll et al.; Shah et al.; Xue et al.). We discovered that after TP intervention, the protein levels of ACSL4 and LPCAT3, as well as the mRNA levels of ALOX15, ALOX12, ALOX8, ALOX5, LPCAT1, and LPCAT3, were significantly increased in AML12 cells. However, the overexpression of Nrf2 can reduce this elevation. Our findings indicate that TP promotes lipid peroxidation by influencing lipid metabolism, leading to ferroptosis in hepatocytes.The SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4 axis is essential for inhibiting ferroptosis. SLC7A11 mediates the uptake of extracellular cystine which is rapidly converted to cysteine for GSH synthesis (Parker et al.). GPX4, a selenium protein, utilizes GSH to scavenge overabundant lipid peroxides (Yang et al.). Inhibition of SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4 axis may lead to uncontrolled accumulation of lipid peroxides, and finally trigger ferroptosis (Forcina and Dixon). We provided evidence in this study that TP caused a significant reduction of SLC7A11, GSH, and GPX4, while the overexpression of GPX4 rendered AML12 cells partly resistant to ferroptosis caused by TP. This observation underscores the vital importance of GPX4 in defensing against TP-induced ferroptosis. Selenium supplementation has been reported to enhance GPX4 expression, reduce oxidative stress, and mitigate ferroptosis and liver injury (Jin et al.; Shi et al.). However, selenium supplementation should be scientific and appropriate, because excessive intake can cause toxicity (Aldosary et al.). Further research is needed to assess whether selenium can prevent and treat TP-induced hepatotoxicity. Nrf2 is a pivotal transcription factor for cellular antioxidant defense. Normally, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1) interacts with Nrf2 and induces its ubiquitination, promoting its degradation by the proteasome. Upon oxidative stress, Nrf2 separates from Keap-1 and relocates to the nucleus, where Nrf2 latches onto the antioxidant response elements (ARE) to activate the transcription of related genes. This process promotes the expression of antioxidant and protective proteins, including SLC7A11, HO-1, and GPX4 (Ma and He). Additionally, Nrf2 can facilitate the maintenance of iron homeostasis via regulating FTH1, TFR1, and FPN (Anandhan et al.). Notably, we observed that the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream factors decreased in the TP-induced liver injury model. TP caused more pronounced ferroptosis and liver damage in Nrf2−/− mice than in WT mice, as indicated by higher serum ALT/AST levels, more severe hepatic histopathological damage, greater iron overload, and elevated lipid peroxidation levels. This might be due to decreased composition and expression of Nrf2-regulated factors, or a loss of the ability of upregulating cellular defense proteins to respond to harmful stimuli (Kitteringham et al.). Furthermore, we found that overexpression of Nrf2 can inhibit ferroptosis induced by TP. Therefore, when patients are in a pathological state with low Nrf2 expression, greater caution should be exercised regarding the occurrence of hepatotoxicity when taking medications containing TP. Meanwhile, the concurrent administration of Nrf2 agonists may be an efficacious strategy for preventing and treating the hepatotoxicity associated with TP.\\', \"ref_108:All calculations were performed with GAUSSIAN 98W and GAUSSIAN 09W and the density functional method using B3LYP, Becke’s three-parameter hybrid method with the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional and the 6-31G* basis set. All stationary points were confirmed with second derivative calculations. Energies reported here include zero-point energy corrections calculated with unscaled B3LYP/6-31G* frequencies obtained analytically with G98W. Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were used to determine reaction pathways. Single point mpw1pw91/6-311+G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G* calculations as recommended by Matsuda were carried out for all stationary points reported. A preparative-scale incubation was carried out using 127 mg (310 mmol) of (cis,trans)-FPP and a total of 18 mg of recombinant wild-type TEAS in order to accumulate sufficient material for chromatographic fractionations, NMR analyses, and optical rotation measurements of the major products as described. Protein expression, purification, and kinetic measurement are detailed in Supporting Information.To investigate the cryptic cyclization activity in TEAS, we synthesized the 2,3-cis geometrical isomer of farnesyl diphosphate (cis,trans)-FPP (1b). This substrate analogue is effectively \\'preisomerized\\', and hence its ionization by TEAS would be expected to generate the cisoid farnesyl cation, which in turn should feed directly into the cisoid cyclization pathway (1, panel b). Indeed, our pilot experiments revealed that TEAS generated a near exclusive spectrum of cisoid products when incubated with (cis,trans)-FPP (1b) as substrate, including the previously reported iso-prezizaene ((+)-2-epi-prezizaene, 2) as the dominant reaction product (1 and 2). This result demonstrated the ability of TEAS to template the cisoid cyclization pathway with a high degree of product specificity and catalytic efficiency. As detailed in a concurrent report, the structure, stereochemistry, and enantio-purity was determined for nine cisoid products of TEAS isolated from large-scale enzyme incubations with (cis,trans)-FPP (1b), an achievement enabling the formulation of a mechanistic proposal for their biosynthetic origin (1, panel b). Chromatographic separations or enrichments of five hydrocarbon and three alcohol fractions, together with comparative NMR spectral data, chiral GC analyses, optical rotation measurements, and chemical correlations, allowed assignment of structures for (+)-2-epi-prezizaene (2), (−)-α-cedrene (3), α-acoradiene (4), 4-epi-α-acoradiene (5), (−)-β-curcumene (6), nerolidol (7), the α-bisabalol epimers (8 and 9), and 2,3-cis-farnesol (10) shown in 1, panel b and listed in 1. Importantly, knowledge of the relative and absolute stereochemistry of the cisoid hydrocarbon products provided vital information for guiding computational studies and accurately describing the stereochemical course of the TEAS cisoid cyclization reaction mechanism (1, panel b and below). To further characterize the product specificity of wild-type TEAS and a previously described promiscuous mutant (A274T V372I Y406L V516I) referred to here as M4 TEAS, we performed GC−MS analyses via the vial assay to examine product mass spectra derived from native (1a) and (cis,trans)-FPP (1b) substrates (2 and 1). TEAS generated 18 distinct terpene products from the 2-cis substrate, including (+)-2-epi-prezizaene (2), which constitutes nearly half the product spectrum (46% by TIC). With the native all-trans FPP (1a) substrate, M4 TEAS exhibits relaxed product specificity in the terminal steps of the transoid cyclization pathway, producing roughly equal amounts of 5-epi-aristolochene (1), 4-epi-eremophilene (12), and premnaspirodiene (13). With (cis,trans)-FPP (1b), M4 TEAS produced the same repertoire of hydrocarbons as the wild-type enzyme, again displaying relaxed product specificity with only a third of the turnovers producing (+)-2-epi-prezizaene (2). This result indicates that the catalytic promiscuity of M4 TEAS extends to the cisoid pathway. To assess the efficiency of the enzymatic conversion of (cis,trans)-FPP (1b) to (+)-2-epi-prezizaene (2) by wild-type TEAS and M4 TEAS, we conducted steady-state kinetic experiments (2). The experiments using (trans,trans)-FPP (1a) reveal that both enzymes display comparable catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km), with the higher Km of M4 TEAS (13.3 μM) offset by a higher overall turnover number (9.4 min−1). Both enzymes utilize (cis,trans)-FPP (1b) with similar catalytic efficiencies, with the promiscuous TEAS M4 possessing a Km (7.9 μM) lower than that of wild-type but also a slower overall turnover (4.6 min−1), the reverse of the trend observed for (trans,trans)-FPP (1a). Additionally, enzymatic activities were assessed using the 2-fluoro analogues of (trans,trans)-FPP (2a) and (cis,trans)-FPP (2b) (1, panel a). Wild-type TEAS and several of its catalytically active mutants fail to turn over either (2-trans,6-trans)-2-fluorofarnesyl diphosphate (trans-2F-FPP, 2a) or (2-cis,6-trans)-2-fluorofarnesyl diphosphate (cis-2F-FPP, 2b) after 24-h incubation periods. The lack of measurable catalytic activity when using the fluoro-substituted FPPs is most likely due to a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect due to the presence of the fluoro substituent at position 2 that prevents ionization and pyrophosphate loss. By contrast, the fungal sesquiterpene cyclase aristolochene synthase converted trans-2F-FPP (2a) cleanly to 2-fluorogermacrene A after extended incubation times, and trichodiene synthase produced several fluorinated sesquiterpene hydrocarbons of unknown structure. Although unreactive fluoro analogues have been useful for crystallography with limonene synthase and more recently 2F-FPP complexes with aristolochene synthase, the inertness of the 2-fluoro-FPPs proved useful for our crystallographic experiments.\", \"ref_109:Trimethyl (squalenyl) ammonium chloride salt (Sq+, 2) and 1,20-bis-trimethylammonium (hexanorsqualenyl) dimethanesulfonate salt (Sq++, 3) were synthesized from SQ according to Fig. 2. Briefly, to obtain Sq+ 2, the trisnorsqualene alcohol 4 was prepared by sodium borohydride reduction of the corresponding aldehyde obtained by periodic acid cleavage of 2,3-epoxysqualene according to van Tamelen. Alcohol 4 was activated as methanesulfonate by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine. The latter was then converted into 1-chlorotrisnorsqualene 6 by nucleophilic substitution with lithium chloride in dimethylformamide. Finally, heating of chloride 6 with a large excess of trimethylamine at 100 °C in ethanol in a sealed tube gave the desired trimethylammonium chloride salt (Sq+) 2 in 98% yield. In a similar manner, the known 1,20-hexanorsqualene diol 7 available from SQ via 2,3,22,23-dioxidosqualene was converted to Sq++ 3, via the symmetrical bismesylate 8 upon treatment with trimethylamine in 92% yield as described above. The 1H NMR spectra of Sq+ and Sq++ showed single peaks at 3.21 ppm and 3.18 ppm respectively, attributed to the trimethylamino group and additionally for Sq++ the mesylate peak was observed at 2.84 ppm. The presence of these signals confirmed the successful synthesis of the two CSq derivatives. These two salts were fully characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, mass spectrometry and their purity was assessed by elemental analysis including dosage of sulfur and oxygen for salt 3.NPs based on the formation of an ion-pair complex between CSq and polyanionic Fpx were prepared by nanoprecipitation (Fig. 3). Nanoprecipitation is the most common technique used to prepare NPs. It combines the advantages of a one-step preparation, a facile scale-up procedure and the use of less toxic solvents as compared to other fabrication methods. The synthesized Sq+ and Sq++ cationic derivatives were comparatively used for the formation of Fpx-loaded NPs. It was observed that the two SqC alone were not able to self-assemble as NPs in water, but formed large aggregates (when used alone in the nanoprecipitation technique). However, when used in combination with Fpx, the spontaneous formation of NPs in water was observed (Fig. 3), likely due to electrostatic CSq/Fpx and hydrophobic CSq–CSq interactions. Particle size is an important parameter determining the in vivo fate of the NPs after oral administration and as a rule thumb, sizes smaller than 500 nm are considered to facilitate the interactions with the epithelia. In this respect, the NP preparation was optimized to obtain stable monodisperse colloidal suspensions together with high drug loadings. For this purpose, different parameters were tested: i) the nature of the organic solvent (acetone or ethanol), ii) the volume ratio of the two phases (organic/aqueous phases) and iii) the concentration of CSq. The first parameter needed to be identified was a solvent of CSq, also miscible with water. Since Sq++ was insoluble in acetone, NPs could be obtained only by using ethanol. In the case of Sq+, the best solvent to obtain small (around 200 nm) and monodisperse NPs was acetone. The influence of the volume ratio acetone/water was further investigated for optimization of Fpx:Sq+ NPs (see Supporting information, § 1). The lowest volume ratio organic to aqueous phase of 1:10 was found to be the best to obtain monodisperse NPs (polydispersity of 0.07 ± 0.01) with smaller mean diameter (145 ± 6 nm). Thus, the volume ratio of 1:10 was chosen for further evaluation of the influence of the amount of CSq (Sq+ and Sq++) on the formation of the NPs. Table 1 reports the physicochemical characteristics for the two types of NPs at various Fpx–CSq ratios. In the case of NPs prepared using Sq+, whatever the experimental conditions, nanoprecipitation was successful, leading to the formation of NPs with mean diameter lower than 200 nm and polydispersity index lower than 0.2. Zeta potential values were approximately − 60 ± 5 mV. Above the threshold of molar ratio Fpx:Sq+ of 1:6, the zeta potential reached values close to zero. Taking into account that Fpx has ten negative charges, at molar ratios Fpx:Sq+ of 1:10 and 1:20 (corresponding to charge ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, respectively), the number of Sq+ per Fpx chain was likely sufficient to neutralize the Fpx charges, leading to a neutral global charge of the resulting Fpx:Sq+ NPs. As a consequence, at these values, the stability of the system was poor (see for further details Supporting information, § 2). (See Table 2.) In contrast to Sq+, Sq++ failed to produce monodisperse NPs except at a ratio below 1:2. Indeed, aggregates or NPs with large sizes up to 772 nm were obtained in other cases (Table 1). Moreover, the NPs prepared with Sq++ were less stable than the Sq+ ones over time and precipitated within two days at 4 °C (see Supporting information, § 2).In a first approach, to determine the amount of incorporated Fpx, Fpx:Sq+ NPs were submitted to destructuration studies in the presence surfactants such as sodium cholate, a bile salt (see Supporting information, § 2). Whatever the experimental conditions, the nanoparticles could not be destructured, but only broken into smaller ones (10 to 50 nm). Therefore, the amount of Fpx inside the particles was determined by assessing the amount of non-encapsulated Fpx in the supernatants after NP centrifugation (for more details see the Materials and methods section). The Azure A assay was an effective method to determine the amount of non-associated Fpx in the supernatants after NP ultracentrifugation. Fig. 4 presents the encapsulation efficiencies (EE) obtained using this assay. The best EE were obtained with molar ratios (Fpx to Sq+) of 1:6 and 1:10, showing that 85% and 87%, respectively, of Fpx was successfully associated with Sq+ under the form of NPs. Calculated corresponding loadings reached 38.5% at the ratio 1:6, which is the optimized ratio in this study. Indeed, although the NPs with the 1:10 ratio encapsulated large Fpx amounts too, they were unstable as already discussed before (see also Supporting Information, § 2). To confirm these results, a direct method (elemental analysis) was developed to determine the amount of Fpx associated with the NPs in the pellets obtained after ultracentrifugation. Elemental analysis enabled determining four elements (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur) which were assayed in the pellet and in the supernatant. Carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen are common to both Sq+ and Fpx, while only sulfur is present in Fpx. In the elemental analysis of the optimized NPs (ratio 1:6), all the four elements were present, which clearly confirmed the presence of Fpx. Calculations have shown that 80% of Fpx was associated with the NPs, whereas 20% remained in the supernatants. This is in agreement with the dosage of Fpx in the supernatant using the Azure A assay (ie. 85%, Fig. 4). From these data, it could be concluded that in the NPs, one Fpx molecule was associated with 8 Sq+ molecules, whereas in the supernatants, one Fpx molecule was associated with one Sq+ (see the Material and methods section, § 2.5.5). Hence, the existence of strong interactions between Fpx and Sq+ could be confirmed, as these two components were always associated, even in the supernatants. For all the experimental conditions studied using the second CSq, Sq++, less than 60% of Fpx was effectively incorporated into the NPs (Fig. 5) and the resulting NPs were less stable especially at ratios > 1:3. In conclusion, among the two CSq synthesized here, Sq+ was the most adapted to encapsulate efficiently Fpx (EE over 80%). The morphology of the optimized Fpx:Sq+ NPs (molar ratio Fpx to Sq+ of 1:6) was investigated by cryo-TEM (Fig. 6a). The Fpx:Sq+ NPs had a regular spherical shape with an inner \\'onion-type\\' structure. Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used in conjunction to cryo-TEM to provide a better insight into the supramolecular organization of the NPs. A (repeat order) correlation peak at q = 0.13 Å− 1 and a very weak second order at about q = 0.26 Å− 1 were observed on the scattering curve of the NPs (Fig. 6c). Supposing a lamellar organization, a thickness of about 48 Å of the lamella could be estimated from the peak at 0.13 Å− 1. This pattern is consistent with the interlamellar distance measured on the cryo-TEM images (45–50 Å, Fig. 6a). Taking into account these considerations, the hypothesized supramolecular organization of the Fpx:Sq+ NPs is represented in Fig. 6b. Likely, the \\'onion\\'-like structure consists of hydrated layers of Fpx interacting with layers of Sq+. Presumably, both Fpx-Sq+ electrostatic interactions and Sq+-Sq+ hydrophobic interactions play a role for maintaining the cohesion of these assemblies. However, further studies would be needed to fully unravel the supramolecular organization of these NPs.The anticoagulant activity of the optimized Fpx:Sq+ aqueous nanoparticulate suspensions was evaluated in vivo after oral and intravenous (IV) administration in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Blood samples were periodically taken and the plasma concentration of active Fpx was estimated using an anti-FXa assay. Fig. 7A shows the plasma concentration–time profile of free Fpx (saline solution) as compared to encapsulated Fpx after IV administration. Both profiles are very similar, with maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 0.16 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L for free Fpx and encapsulated Fpx, respectively. These results showed that the Fpx associated to the NPs could be released quickly in the blood, resulting in an anticoagulant activity similar to free Fpx. These data prove that Fpx could be effectively dissociated from the Sq+ moieties in the blood stream. Fig. 7B shows the plasma concentration–time profile of free Fpx (saline solution) as compared to encapsulated Fpx after oral administration. As expected, Fpx in saline solution was not absorbed. The concentration-profiles were similar to those of the control group. By contrast, administration of nanoparticulate suspensions at two distinct concentrations resulted in an increase in plasma concentration of Fpx (Fig. 7B). The NPs containing Fpx doses of 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg showed Cmax of about 0.11 mg/L and 0.22 mg/L, respectively with a time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of around 60 min in both cases. These results revealed a dose-dependent increase in Cmax whereas the time to reach maximal concentration (Tmax) was dose-independent. Of note, the Cmax obtained after oral administration of 50 mg/kg Fpx:Sq+ was close to the prophylactic plasma concentration needed in venous thromboembolism. It was concluded that the newly developed nanoparticulate system could improve the oral delivery of Fpx as compared to the free Fpx. However, the absolute bioavailability still remained low (around 0.3%) probably due to the instability of Fpx:Sq+ at the acidic pH of the stomach. To avoid this, the nanoparticles were entrapped into Eudragit L100®-coated capsules, resistant to the pH in the stomach. For this, nanoparticles have been lyophilized in the presence of trehalose, recovering the same features as before (\\'onion-type\\' structures, mean diameter and zeta potential preserved, as assessed by cryo-TEM and DLS, respectively). Fig. 7C shows the concentration–time profiles of free-form of Fpx and Fpx-loaded nanoparticles administered orally in enteric-coated capsules. A very low plasma Fpx concentration was observed in the rats orally treated with the Eudragit L100®-coated capsules filled with the free-form of Fpx. By contrast, oral administration of enteric-coated capsules filled with Fpx-loaded nanoparticles enabled reaching a maximum plasma concentration of 0.43 mg/mL at 3 h post-administration (Fig. 7C). The plasma concentrations of Fpx in the rats were increased significantly with nanoparticles (p < 0.05 at 10 mg/kg) compared with those in the control or free Fpx. In the case of nanoparticles, the area under the plasma Fpx concentration versus time curve, AUC (0–5 h) was 38.73 ± 19.01 mg·min/mL, which corresponds to a bioavailability of 9.01 ± 2.60%. In conclusion, when administered orally to fed rats, the Fpx bioavailability was dramatically increased up to 9.01% with nanoparticles as compared to less than 0.5% for free Fpx (Fig. 7C). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between fasted and fed rats. Food increases around 48% the maximal plasma concentration of Fpx. With further studies, this nanoparticulate system holds promises for the oral delivery of Fpx.\", \\'ref_110:We had previously reported that human mature white adipocytes can acquire the brown fat cell properties upon PPARγ or PPARα activation. The brown identity of a fat cell relies on its capacity to sustain thermogenesis, for example, possessing sufficiently high mitochondrial oxidative capacities associated with activation of the bona fide uncoupling protein, UCP1. Indeed, CA treatment of white hMADS adipocytes prevents the rosiglitazone-induced browning as measured by UCP1 mRNA and protein expression as well as another thermogenic marker, CPT1M. Moreover, CA treatment of brite hMADS adipocytes led to a loss of the UCP1 expression that is characteristic of the whitening process. The effects of CA are reversible, demonstrating that the inhibitory effects of CA did not result in disappearance of the thermogenic expression profile. CA antagonizes the effects of rosiglitazone in a dose-dependent manner leading to the reduction of maximal response at 10 µM and small effects on the half maximal doses. Depending on the gene, the effects are either very pronounced (UCP1), moderate (FABP4), or finally weak effects on adipogenic markers that are not PPAR targets (PLIN1). Similar effects of CA were observed when using mouse primary cultures of adipocyte precursors with lower inhibition, which might be due to the presence of fetal calf serum and the existence of potential proteins trapping CA. Using transactivation assays, our data show that CA antagonizes rosiglitazone at the PPARγ ligand-binding domain. Regarding PPARα, the effects are less efficient with 15% inhibition compared to 50% for PPARγ. As these experiments were carried out in the presence of fetal calf serum, one cannot rule out the presence of a potential PPARα agonist leading to a high background response. Indeed, in the presence of CA, the background response was lower and the maximal response to PPARα (GW7647) was slightly inhibited (Supplementary Figure S4). Altogether, our observations indicate that CA is a noncompetitive PPAR antagonist with a higher affinity for PPARγ than for PPARα.CA is a phenolic diterpene, and given its lipidic nature, one can hypothesize that CA is able to interfere with PPAR ligands in the ligand-binding domain in a reversible manner to regulate receptor activity. In the absence of rosiglitazone, CA was able to inhibit adipogenic marker expression, suggesting that CA might antagonize endogenously synthesized ligands/activators. We cannot rule out the possibility that CA might exert some effects on the recruitment of cofactors and/or affect PPAR modifications such as phosphorylation. Further studies are necessary to shed some light on the mechanisms of interaction of CA and PPARs. The development of a new generation of natural PPAR antagonists represents a promising approach to address selectivity and therapeutic concerns.\\', \\'ref_111:In a previous study, we found that TMEM16A was highly amplified and overexpressed in the human colon cancer cell line SW620 and RNAi-mediated knockdown of TMEM16A in SW620 cells decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion. DP, a Terpene isolated from Andrographis paniculata Nees, has been reported to possess a broad range of pharmacological effects, including anti-cancer activities. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the potential effects of DP on TMEM16A-dependent SW620 cells and further examined whether TMEM16A was involved in the DP-induced regulation of activity in SW620 cells. To explore the effects of DP on TMEM16A-CaCC activity in SW620 cells, we performed inside-out patch clamp recordings on SW620 cells using a 1 μM free calcium pipette solution to activate TMEM16A-CaCC currents. Above all, the currents activated by 1 μM Ca2+ from patches of SW620 cells were confirmed to be TMEM16A-CaCC currents by inhibition of the chloride channel inhibitor (NFA) and the TMEM16A specific inhibitor T16Ainh-A01 (Fig 2A). Then, the effects of DP on TMEM16A-CaCC activity in SW620 cells were detected. As Fig 2B shows, CaCC currents in TMEM16A-expressing SW620 cells were attenuated rapidly after the addition of DP and restored quickly after DP washout. The effects of DP on TMEM16A-CaCC currents were dose-dependent. Addition of 50 μM DP resulted in almost complete inhibition, and 5 μM DP reduced CaCC currents by 19.6 ± 4.5% (Fig 2C). Repeated application of DP elicited similar reductions in the amplitude of the current.To elucidate the potential role of TMEM16A in the DP-induced decrease in SW620 cell migration and invasion, we chose SW480 cells as the control, which shares the same genetic background as SW620 cells but lacks amplified TMEM16A. We detected the effect of DP on the migration and invasion of SW480 cells using wound-healing and transwell invasion assays. As Fig 7 shows, the application of 5 μM DP has no detectable effect on the migration and invasion behaviour of SW480 cells compared to the control group. These results showed that TMEM16A-dependent SW620 cells were sensitive to DP compared to TMEM16A-independent SW480 cells, which may be due to the involvement of TMEM16A. To further confirm the contribution of TMEM16A in the inhibition of migration and the invasion by DP, TMEM16A mRNA and protein expression were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting after the SW620 cells were treated with DP over a time course. As shown in Fig 8, DP significantly decreased the protein expression level of TMEM16A in a time-dependent manner compared with the control. However, the treatment of SW620 cells with DP had no effect on TMEM16A mRNA levels (data not shown). These results indicate that DP might regulate TMEM16A expression at the post-transcriptional level in SW620 cells.\\', \"ref_112:MCF2Chem is the first manually curated knowledge base that details the production of biosynthetic compounds by microbial cell factory and incorporates recommendation system. MCF2Chem includes information on microbial species and the compounds synthesized by those species, production data of the synthesized compounds (titer, yield, productivity, and content), strain culture conditions (carbon source/precursor/substrate, and medium), fermentation information (fermentation mode, vessel, scale, and condition), and other information (e.g., strain modifications). In addition, statistical analyses related to every microbial chassis and compound were automatically performed and presented on the webpage; the recommendation system was built based on data contained in MCF2Chem and additional chemical- and strain-related data. The search function of MCF2Chem allows the required references to be quickly located by querying production data, such as titer, yield, and productivity. Statistical analyses not only provide a general overview of the biosynthesis in microbial cell factories but may also be beneficial for evaluating biosynthesis capacity of target microbial chassis and the biosynthesis situation of target compounds. It is also useful for mining potential chassis for target compounds or potential synthesizable compounds for target chassis. Data in MCF2Chem were extracted from reviews of metabolic engineering in synthetic biology over the past 5 years (Additional file 1: Table S1). The top three journals contributing the most reviews used for data extraction were \\'Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology\\', \\'World Journal of Microbiology & Biotechnology\\', and \\'Biotechnology Advances\\' (Additional file 2: Fig. S1). In total, 8888 items of production records were extracted from 268 review articles, involving information from 4765 original microbial metabolic engineering articles (92 records were those of patents; Table 1). The 4765 articles concerned spanned the period from 1946 to 2022, peaking during the 2013–2020 period (Additional file 2: Fig. S2). Many of these articles were published in various new journals devoted to synthetic biology or metabolic engineering, such as \\'Metabolic Engineering\\', \\'Bioresource Technology\\', \\'Microbial Cell Factories\\', and \\'Biotechnology for Biofuels\\', which accounted for nearly half of the top 10 source journals (Additional file 2: Fig. S3).MCF2Chem contains data relating to 1231 chemical compound products and 590 microbial species (Table 1). Bacteria were the main producers, both in terms of the number of microbial species used for biosynthesis and types of synthesized compounds. Bacteria accounted for more than 60% of the total microbial chassis and synthesized approximately 68% of the chemical products. Yeasts produced 37% of the chemical products. Fungi and microalgae were similar in most respects, except those microalgae outnumbered fungi in the number of products. In addition to single-strain production, the database covers the production of a small number of mixed strains and other modes of production (Table 1). In terms of the types of compounds synthesized, bacteria and yeast showed similar synthetic profiles. For product quantity, bacteria produced similar quantities of \\'shikimic acids and phenylpropionic acids\\', \\'terpenoids\\', and \\'fatty acids\\', while yeasts were dominant in the production of \\'fatty acids\\', \\'terpenoids\\', and \\'shikimates and phenylpropyl esters\\' in that order. The types of compounds synthesized by fungi and microalgae were similar, primarily comprising \\'fatty acids\\' and \\'terpenoids\\' (Fig. 1A). In the top 20 microbial species with the most products, E. coli, S. cerevisiae, Y. lipolytica, and C. glutamate synthesized ~78% of the chemical compounds and were adept at synthesizing \\'shikimates and phenylpropanoids\\', \\'terpenoids\\', \\'fatty acids\\', and \\'amino acids and peptides\\', respectively. Among them, E. coli produced a quarter of these compounds (Fig. 1B). E. coli and S. cerevisiae produced similar types of compounds. Streptomyces were adept at synthesizing \\'polyketides\\'. Synechocystis sp. and Synechococcus sp., the microalgae with the most chemical products, mainly synthesized \\'fatty acids\\' and \\'terpenoids\\' (Fig. 1B). In terms of temporal development, the number of microbial chassis (especially bacteria) used to synthesize compounds has increased rapidly over the past 20 years. Over the past 10 years, the capability of microalgae to act as microbial cell factories has developed relatively quickly. In addition to the use of single strains, the use of mixed-strain fermentation has gradually increased over this period as well (Fig. 2A). The number and highest titers of compounds, especially those produced by bacteria and yeast, were also improved markedly (Fig. 2B, C). The average titer of compounds synthesized by yeast was lower than that of compounds synthesized by bacteria, which may be due to the increased synthesis proportion of natural products that generally have lower titers (Additional file 2: Fig. S4).MCF2Chem contains 1231 non-duplicate chemical compound products after data processing. Among them, 835 compounds with chemical structures were involved in the nc_pathway classification predicted by NPClassifier. The main compounds synthesized by microbial species were \\'fatty acids\\', \\'terpenoids\\', and \\'shikimates and phenylpropanoids\\' (Figs. 3A, 4A). The cf_superclass classification predicted by ClassyFire for these compounds indicated that the top three categories of products were \\'lipids and lipid-like molecules\\', \\'organic acids and derivatives\\', and \\'organic oxygen compounds\\' (Fig. 3B). The top 10 compound products with the highest counts were lipids, 1-butanol, ethanol, succinic acid, resveratrol, 2,3-butanediol, butyric acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates, and xylitol (Fig. 3C). The top three compounds with the highest counts in different broad categories were 1-butanol, ethanol, and succinic acid in the \\'fatty acids\\' category; squalene, astaxanthin, and lycopene in the \\'terpenoids\\' category; resveratrol, shikimic acid, and naringenin in the \\'shikimates and phenylpropanoids\\' category; xylitol, mannitol, and fructosylated chondroitin in the \\'carbohydrates\\' category; gamma-aminobutyric acid, lysine, and valine in the \\'amino acids and peptides\\' category; and riboflavin, violacein, and cadaverine in the \\'alkaloids\\' category. Compounds in the \\'fatty acids\\', \\'amino acids and peptides\\', and \\'carbohydrates\\' categories performed well in terms of maximum and average titers (Fig. 4B, Additional file 2: Fig. S5), whereas the product titers of \\'terpenoids\\', \\'shikimates and phenylpropanoids\\', \\'alkaloids\\', and \\'polyketides\\' were relatively low. These natural products are secondary metabolites, some of them having very complex structures and low titers, which may explain the generally low average titers of compounds produced by terpene-producing microbial yeasts. Platform chemicals, including sugar alcohols, furanic compounds, and carboxylic acids, are small molecules that may be synthesized from biomass via chemical conversion or fermentation. The biosyntheses of some common platform chemicals were also statistically analyzed (Table 2). MCF2Chem contains 5873 carbon source/substrate/precursor records. Among these, records containing glucose, glycerol, and xylose accounted for 41%, 11%, and 11% of the total records, respectively. CO2 and methanol were promising carbon sources, accounting for 2.5% of the records. The top three products that yielded the highest titers when using methanol as a carbon source/substrate/precursor were glutamic acid (60 g L−1), polyhydroxybutyrate (52.9 g L−1), and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (46.1 g L−1), which were synthesized by Bacillus methanolicus, Methylorubrum extorquens, and Methylobacterium extorquens, respectively, all of which are species that utilize methanol. The top three corresponding products with the highest titers, using CO2 as a carbon source/substrate/precursor, were acetate (59.2 g L−1), 2,3-butanediol (32 g L−1), and ethanol (20.7 g L−1) synthesized by Acetobacterium woodii, Cupriavidus necator, and Clostridium ljungdahlii, respectively, indicating the advantages conferred by these rather than other strains when utilizing different carbon sources.MCF2Chem also contains 2678 records of fermentation vessels. Notably, different flasks were the main vessels, accounting for 56%, followed by fermenters and reactors, accounting for 33%. The volumes of the fermenters and reactors were typically within 5 L. Two recommendation function modules were constructed based on evolutionary phylogenetic relationships of strains and compound similarity using MCF2Chem and other auxiliary data to explore potential compounds and chassis. Each module had three recommended routes: S2C/C2S (Strain to Compounds or Compound to Strains), S2C2C/C2S2S, and S2S2C/C2C2S. Diverse recommendation routes provided greater scalability and potential. Users may gain new insights into unreported chemical production or microbial chassis utilization. The compounds or species resulting from the use of different recommended routes were ranked using a corresponding scoring function, which assigned a certain weight to different data for comprehensive consideration. This recommendation system has now been integrated into MCF2Chem. MCF2Chem provides retrieval and recommendation pages (Fig. 5A, B). For retrieval, it offers both simple and advanced methods. Compound- and strain-detailed information, including basic information, organism taxonomy, statistics corresponding to all detailed records, and similar compounds or species, can be found on the species and compound Details pages (Fig. 5C). The Recommendation Result pages of compounds and strains display the corresponding detailed recommendation record, score, and indicate whether the data have been reported (Fig. 5D, E). MCF2Chem also provides a Browsing page that presents records of all data including the following: species information and its category; chemical product and its category; production data (titer, yield, productivity, and content); culture and fermentation data (carbon source/precursor/substrate, medium, mode, vessel, scale, and condition); and other data (such as metabolic engineering strategy and strain genotype) (Fig. 5F). Each production record is also available on the Production Record Details page. A channel that enables users to upload data to compensate for missing data can also be found in MCF2Chem.It is difficult to accurately conduct text mining owing to the complexity of the relationship between various entities of microbial biosynthetic data. Furthermore, manually extracting information directly from original literature is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Many review articles have periodically summarized and described the categories and yields of the compounds biosynthesized by various microbial cell factories or provided the modification and fermentation information of the microbial cell factories used for biosynthesis of a specific compound or class of compounds. Therefore, the data in MCF2Chem were extracted from reviews that covered compounds biosynthesized via microbial strains within the last 5 years, including microbial species, the compounds synthesized using them, related production data, culture conditions, fermentation data, strain modifications, and other information.MCF2Chem does not only provide a search function, but also facilitates data statistics and comparison, particularly data on titers, yields, and productivities, thus leading to an evaluation of the biosynthetic capacity of various strains and production situation of various compounds. Therefore, data standardization and classification are critical for data statistics. During this process, some difficulties were encountered. Because some compounds are newly synthesized chemicals, biopolymers, or mixtures, approximately 32% of the compounds in MCF2Chem cannot be retrieved from PubChem; thus, they cannot be classified in batches, which is inconvenient for data comparison. Moreover, the production units used were diverse, and some units were difficult to unify. Depending on data characteristics and experimental purposes, researchers tend to choose optimal expression methods and units, leading to diversity in units and increasing the difficulty of data comparison.As of 2022, 73 countries have been involved in the exploration of microbial biosynthesis, according to incomplete statistics from MCF2Chem (Additional file 2: Fig. S6). China, the US, and South Korea are the top three countries associated with the most of research in this field that also contain the largest number of related research institutions. The highest output ratios were observed in Denmark and Switzerland (Additional file 2: Fig. S7). Among all the institutions, Jiangnan University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Tianjin University ranked as the top three in terms of both the articles and products (Additional file 2: Fig. S8). Importantly, compound biosynthesis of microbial cell factory appears to have entered a phase of rapid development in global research (Additional file 2: Fig. S9).\", \\'ref_113:We were next concerned with why geniposide can rescue formaldehyde-treated SH-SY5Y cells. First, HPLC was used to measure changes in the concentrations of formaldehyde in the cell culture medium. The results showed that the residual content of formaldehyde decreased by 20% in the presence of 25 μM geniposide (P < 0.05, Figure 4A). We also confirmed that at the concentrations used in the experiments, geniposide, ginsenoside Rg1, and TLJN showed no cytotoxicity to SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 4B). Overall, these results suggest that geniposide rescues formaldehyde-treated cells at least through its capability of decreasing formaldehyde levels. Thus, we next explored the mechanism of this protective effect of geniposide on SH-SY5Y cells. Because both geniposide and formaldehyde were added to SH-SY5Y cells at the same time, and it was shown that geniposide decreased cytotoxicity following formaldehyde treatment, we could not exclude the possibility that geniposide directly interacted with formaldehyde and then rescued the viability of cells. Therefore, in the following experiment we added geniposide to the cell culture medium before cells were treated with formaldehyde. Geniposide was removed after 12 h incubation with SH-SY5Y cells and then geniposide-treated cells were incubated with 0.12 mM formaldehyde for another 12 h. As shown by the CCK-8 assay (Figure 5A), cell viability of the geniposide-pretreated group was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the formaldehyde alone treated group. Geniposide (25 μM) increased the viability of cells from 62.1% to 80.2%, similar to that of 100 and 250 μM geniposide. On the other hand, we treated cells with 0.12 mM formaldehyde for 6 h first, and then incubated cells with geniposide or both geniposide and formaldehyde for 24 h. Results from the CCK-8 assay demonstrated that geniposide could improve viability following formaldehyde injury under either condition (Figure 5B). The addition of 25 μM geniposide to formaldehyde-injured cells increased their viability from 37.9% to 54.2% (P < 0.05). Viability increased from 15.6% to 36.1% in cells pretreated with formaldehyde for 6 h and in cells exposed to formaldehyde for 24 h following addition of geniposide (P < 0.01). This demonstrates that protection of SH-SY5Y cells by geniposide is not because of a direct interaction of geniposide with formaldehyde, but because of the activation of related cellular pathways.To determine how geniposide protects cells from formaldehyde toxicity, we first monitored the rate of apoptosis after treatment. SH-SY5Y cells (plated at 1×106) were grown in 60 mm plates overnight. Culture medium was then replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 0.12 mM formaldehyde supplemented with 25 or 100 μM geniposide for 24 h. Flow cytometry revealed that 5.82% of non-treated SH-SY5Y cells were apoptotic (Figure 6A). Incubation with 100 μM geniposide (Figure 6B) could suppress formaldehyde-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells with the percentage of apoptotic cells decreasing from 12.15% to 5.25% when compared with formaldehyde-only treated cells (Figure 6C), indicating the inhibitory effect of geniposide on apoptosis. Bcl-2 is the founding member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulator proteins. Thus, we investigated the changes in Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression. Our results showed that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with formaldehyde induced a robust decrease in both Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels, followed by an increase in apoptotic cell death when cells were incubated with formaldehyde. However, treatment with different concentrations of geniposide (25 μM and 100 μM) was able to rescue levels of both Bcl-2 mRNA (Figure 7A) and protein (Figure 7B) in the presence of formaldehyde. The expression of Bcl-2 mRNA decreased by 56.1% after exposure to formaldehyde, but treatment with geniposide markedly increased the expression of Bcl-2 from 213.2% (25 μM geniposide) to 259.3% (100 μM geniposide). We also measured the expressions of P53, caspase 3 and caspase 9 mRNA by quantitative real time PCR. P53 is a key modulator of the cellular stress response, and activation of P53 can trigger apoptosis in many cell types including neurons. Caspases play essential roles in apoptosis and caspase 3 is a key executer of apoptosis, whose activation is mediated by the initiator caspases, such as caspase 9. The expression of P53, caspase 3 and caspase 9 mRNA increased sharply by 261.5%, 248.2% and 90.5%, respectively, in the formaldehyde-treated group. In the geniposide-treated group, the expression of these genes decreased markedly by 70.7% (P53), 82.3% (caspase 3) and 75.8% (caspase 9) after 25 μM geniposide treatment and by 70.0% (P53), 89.8% (caspase 3) and 80.1% (caspase 9) after 100 μM geniposide treatment. These results suggest that Bcl-2, P53, caspase 3 and caspase 9 are involved in the protective effect of geniposide following formaldehyde injury of SH-SY5Y cells. The generation of excess levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is important for the activation of apoptosis. SOD, GSHPx and catalase play a critical antioxidative role in tissues and organs. Therefore, we next tested the activity of SOD, GSHPx and catalase in cells. As shown in Figure 8A and 8B, after exposure to formaldehyde, the activity of SOD and GSHPx decreased significantly (P < 0.05) when compared with the control. In contrast, treatment with 100 μM geniposide markedly increased the activity of SOD (from 63.7% to 107.2%, P < 0.01) and GSHPx (from 81.5% to 127.5%, P < 0.01) when compared with DMSO-incubated cells under our experimental conditions. The activity of catalase (Figure 8C) did not differ among the four experimental groups. This result demonstrates that geniposide improves the activity of SOD and GSHPx leading to suppression of apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells in the presence of formaldehyde.\\', \\'ref_114:Many studies have demonstrated that PD-1/PD-L1 targeted therapy provides a promising cancer immunotherapy approach through the inhibition of multiple stages of the immune response between T-cells and tumors. In particular, PD-L1 can be upregulated in accordance with infiltrating immune cells and the changing microenvironment within tumors, suggesting that it may prove to be a biomarker of cancer immunotherapy. In order to identify the inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 binding interactions, we applied an assay system that detects the blocking ratio in competition with PD-1. In this assay, 12 ginsenosides were evaluated using biotin-labeled PD-1 to determine whether these compounds may be candidates for inhibiting PD-1/PD-L1 binding interactions. In general, PDS and PTS have a low rate of absorption in the intestines as a result of their hydrophilicity. Thus, upon oral intake, PDS and PTS are transformed into the small metabolites PPD and PPT, respectively, through deglycosylation and acid hydrolysis catalyzed by intestinal bacteria. Among the eight kinds of PDS (Figure 1A), ginsenosides Rd (GS3), F2 (GS4), Rg3 (GS5), and C-K (GS6) are mainly detected in human plasma. In addition, C-K has been found in the healthy volunteers’ blood treated with Rb1 (GS1), confirming the metabolic processing of ginsenosides. Four kinds of PTS are present in the transformation pathway from Rg1 (GS9) to PPT (GS12) (Figure 1B). Ginsenoside Rg1 and its metabolites are also biotransformed via deglycosylation in the intestine and detected in plasma; however, the indicated amounts are very low because of the poor oral bioavailability of Rg1, which results from the limited membrane permeability and active biliary excretion of Rg1.Based on the structural features of the ginsenoside metabolites, we analyzed the individual efficacy of 12 ginsenosides for inhibiting PD-1/PD-L1 binding interactions using a competition assay. In addition, to ensure the reliability of this method, the inhibitory efficacy of the PD-1 neutralizing antibody directly binding with PD-L1 was confirmed as a positive control (Supplementary Materials Data Figure S1). As shown in Figure 2, almost all ginsenosides, including Rd, F2, Rg3, C-K, Rh2, PPD, Rg1, and Rh1 (from GS3 to GS10), showed an ability to block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions at 35% at the maximum concentration (1 μM), while four ginsenosides, Rb1, Rb2, F1, and PPT, showed no inhibition. Interestingly, the competitive inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions was stronger for the metabolic products compared to the parent ginsenosides Rb1 and Rb2. In particular, Rg3 and C-K showed significantly high inhibitory rates of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in a dose-dependent manner at 60.4% and 67.7%, respectively, at 1 μM. These results indicated that ginsenoside metabolites may be potent ICB candidates against PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. Based on the above results, we performed molecular docking in order to further identify the interactions between PD-1/PD-L1 and the ginsenosides Rg3 and C-K on the basis of the crystal structures of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex (PDB code: 4ZQK) and the PD-1/PD-L1 small molecule complex. As shown in Figure 3A, in silico modeling of Rg3 and C-K into the PD-1/PD-L1 binding pocket resulted in higher docking scores for C-K, for both PD-1 and PD-L1 (−6.3 and −6.4 kcal/mol, respectively), compared with Rg3 (−5.9 and −6.0 kcal/mol, respectively). Using pharmacophore analysis, we further investigated the associated hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds formed at the interfaces between PD-1/PD-L1 and the ginsenosides with LigPlot+ software (Figure 3B). Rg3 formed four hydrogen bonds (i.e., T45, Y68, P83, and E136) and eight hydrophobic interactions (i.e., V64, N66, K78, A81, E84, I126, L128, and I134) with PD-1 and five hydrogen bonds (i.e., Y56, D61, N63, Q66, and A121) and three hydrophobic interactions (i.e., M115, D122, and Y123) with PD-L1. Several amino acids in PD-1 (or PD-L1), associated with the interaction with Rg3, have been reported to play important roles in PD-1/PD-L1 interaction (PD-1, V64, N64, Y68, K78, I126, L128, and E136; PD-L1, Y56, Q66, M115, A121, D122, and Y123). C-K also formed five hydrogen bonds (i.e., N66, T76, D77, K78, and E84) and six hydrophobic interactions (i.e., V64, Y68, A81, I126, L128, and I134) with PD-1 and nine hydrophobic interactions (i.e., I54, Y56, Q66, V68, R113, C114, M115, A121, and Y123) with PD-L1. In particular, a number of amino acids in PD-1 (V64, I126, L128, and I134) and PD-L1 (I54, Y56, R113, M115, A121, and Y123) were found to interact with C-K and were involved in the hydrophobic interactions required to form the PD-1/PD-L1 complex. These results confirmed that C-K is a promising inhibitor of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions.In recent clinical studies and clinical trials, it has been revealed that multiple additional co-inhibitory pathways by single agents or combination treatment lead to significant anticancer effects by affecting various immune response stages. Despite the significant success in the treatment of various malignancies, antibody drugs have a high rate of irAEs, with multiple immune-related adverse reactions observed in immune-cancer therapy. Therefore, immunotherapeutic approaches have recently focused on the development of small molecules that can overcome the negative effects of antibody drugs. In one previous study, Rg3 reduced PD-L1 expression by cisplatin resistance and resumed the cytotoxicity of cancer cells by activating T-cells in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that Rg3 can attenuate chemotherapeutic resistance, improving the efficacy of chemotherapy and prolonging the survival of patients with NSCLC. These significant studies indicated that ginsenosides may regulate the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in target diseases; however, these studies did not demonstrate the function of ginsenosides as inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 binding interactions. Although we applied the competition assay for screening PD-1/PD-L1 targeted inhibitors, on the basis of these results, we plan to apply other screening approaches in future research, including the antagonist-induced dissociation assay (AIDA) NMR, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In addition, further study of the active ginsenosides in cellular and animal-based studies of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is warranted.\\', \\'ref_115:To construct a recombinant P. pastoris strain capable of producing germacrene A, we introduced Anabaena variabilis-derived germacrene A synthase gene (GAS, which was codon optimized for yeast expression) (Zhang et al.) into P. pastoris GS115-Cas9 (GAS0). The resultant strain GAS1, containing a copy of GAS expression cassette TEF1p-GAS-AOX1t, generated a new peak on GC chromatogram (Additional file 1: Fig. S2), which was further confirmed to be β-elemene by MS analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). The titer of germacrene A produced by GAS1 was determined to be around 27.3 mg/L (Fig. 2), indicating the necessity of further metabolic engineering efforts.To increase the titer of germacrene A, we attempted to fuse ERG20 with GAS. Previous studies indicated that fusion enzymes were beneficial for product biosynthesis and the linker sequences between fusion proteins could affect pathway performance (Hu et al.). Thus, we experimented with four different linkers, including GGS, GGGGS, (PT)4P, and (PA)5, leading to the construction of four fusion configurations: ERG20-GGS-GAS, ERG20-GGGGS-GAS, ERG20-(PT)4P-GAS and ERG20-(PA)5-GAS. While GGS and GGGGS are flexible linkers, (PT)4P and (PA)5 represent rigid linkers. Each of these configurations was placed under the control of a strong promoter TEF1p (Fig. 2). In addition, we constructed a control strain GAS2, which overexpressed ERG20 and GAS individually.As shown in Fig. 2, the titer of germacrene A in the recombinant strain GAS2 reached 32.5 mg/L, slightly higher than that of the starting strain GAS1. However, the four fusion-protein expressing strains (GAS3, GAS4, GAS5, and GAS6) exhibited higher titer of germacrene A, indicating that fusion expression could significantly increase the titer of germacrene A. Notably, the fusion-protein (ERG20-(PT)4P-GAS) expressing strain (GAS5) achieved the highest titer of 76.6 mg/L, which was 2.4-fold higher than that of GAS2 (Fig. 2).To further increase germacrene A production, we employed a multi-copy integration strategy to optimize the copy number of the fusion protein (ERG20-(PT)4P-GAS). Our results showed that the titer of germacrene A was increased with more copy numbers of the fusion protein. When the copy number of the fusion protein was four, germacrene A titer of the recombinant strain GAS9 reached 210.0 mg/L (Fig. 3), representing a 7.7-fold increase over the initial strain GAS1.FPP is an essential precursor for sesquiterpene biosynthesis in yeast via the mevalonate (MVA) pathway (Zuo et al.). To increase sesquiterpene titer, FPP supply should be enhanced. Common strategies for increasing FPP supply include overexpression of the rate-limiting enzyme encoding genes of the MVA pathway, such as tHMG1 or isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI1). Thus, we integrated tHMG1 and IDI1 expression cassettes individually or in combination into P. pastoris GAS9 to construct recombinant strains GAS11, GAS12, and GAS13, respectively. The titer of germacrene A was further increased to 258.4 mg/L in the recombinant strain GAS13 (Fig. 3). These results demonstrated that overexpression of rate-limiting enzymes could increase the metabolic flux of FPP and accordingly the titer of germacrene A.To further increase the titer of germacrene A, we added an additional copy of the expression cassette (co-expressing tHMG1 and IDI1) to the recombinant strain GAS13. The resultant strain GAS14 was able to produce 291.4 mg/L germacrene A (Fig. 3), an 11.7-fold increase from the starting strain GAS1. However, increasing the copy number of the expression cassette (co-expressing tHMG1 and IDI1) to three failed to further enhance germacrene A production in the recombinant strain GAS15.Acetyl-CoA is a direct precursor of the mevalonate pathway, and overexpression of acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) can increase precursor supply and thus titer of the downstream products (Zuo et al.). To enhance acetyl-CoA supply and further increase germacrene A titer, we introduced the Salmonella enterocolitica derived acetyl-CoA synthetase gene ACS into the GAS14 strain to obtain the GAS16 strain, which produced 302.6 mg/L of germacrene A (Fig. 3). While the overexpression of ACS could further increase the titer of germacrene A, the effect was not substantial. We subsequently added one or two additional copies of ACS to GAS16, resulting in the construction of GAS17 and GAS18, respectively. However, germacrene A production was even slightly decreased in GAS17 and GAS18 (Fig. 3), probably due to the metabolic burdens of multi-copy integration of ACS. These results indicated that the availability of acetate was limited or the supply of acetyl-CoA was not rate-limiting for germacrene A biosynthesis in P. pastoris.Terpenoids are a diverse class of natural products containing approximately 40,000 known compounds, many of which possess favorable activities and are widely used in various fields such as medicine, food, and cosmetics (Hu et al.; Bohlmann and Keeling). However, traditional methods of plant extraction are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and limited by plant growth (Lu et al.; Sousa et al.; Kato et al.). In recent years, with the rapid development of synthetic biology, efficient production of high-value terpene products using microbial cell factories has attracted increasing attention. Here, we report for the first time on the construction of a P. pastoris cell factory for efficient production of germacrene A.To enhance the production of germacrene A, we employed the strategy of fusing ERG20 and GAS, and tested several fusion linkers including GGS, GGGGS, (PT)4P, and (PA)5. The results showed that ERG20-(PT)4P-GAS (strain GAS5) exhibited the highest titer of germacrene A. Notably, the production of germacrene A in these fusion expression strains (ERG20-GGS-GAS, ERG20-GGGGS-GAS, ERG20-(PT)4P-GAS and ERG20-(PA)5-GAS) was higher than that of the unfused strain GAS2 (ERG20 and GAS overexpressed individually), indicating that fusion expression had a significant impact on enzyme activity. We propose that fusion expression may reduce the loss of intermediate products by shortening the distance between the two enzymes (Additional file 1: Fig. S4), thus enhancing the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Moreover, different linkers were found to affect the biosynthesis performance of the fusion enzymes.\\', \\'ref_116:The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is a core signal transduction system in cellular physiological and pathological processes. It interacts with a variety of other signaling pathways to jointly regulate cell survival, proliferation, migration, metabolism, and other functions. Studies have shown that the activation of this pathway can promote the proliferation and survival of lung cancer cells, inhibiting cell apoptosis, which helps tumors grow and spread. The high expression of PCK2 in NSCLC may serve as a positive prognostic indicator. This study demonstrated a significant increase in PCK2 after the CTTPPPD treatment, suggesting that it may be influenced by the promotion of tumor cell metabolism and the cell-cycle process, leading to a positive therapeutic effect on NSCLC. Other studies have shown that ITGA5 is an early prognostic factor for NSCLC, and the high expression of ITGA5 indicates poor prognosis and a higher risk of tumor metastasis. ITGA5 was significantly down-regulated after CTTPPPD administration, indicating that CTTPPPD administration can effectively inhibit lung cancer metastasis. THBS1 plays a crucial role in suppressing tumor growth, cell migration, and angiogenesis. In NSCLC patients, lower expression of THBS1 indicates a worse prognosis. The administration of CTTPPPD may increase THBS1 expression, leading to the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis, thereby improving treatment outcomes. The PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways are co-activated under the influence of multiple growth factors and extracellular signals, such as through EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). Akt can indirectly influence the activation of ERK, and there is also reciprocal inhibition, where ERK can inhibit certain components of the PI3K/Akt pathway. This demonstrates the dynamic equilibrium and mutual regulation of these two pathways within the intracellular signaling network. The MAPK signaling pathway also plays an important role in the development of cancer. Studies have shown that inhibiting the activation of the MAPK pathway in mice can effectively hinder the progression of NSCLC, thus serving as a potential treatment for cancer. It has been reported that the overexpression of FGFR3 may promote the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer cells by activating the MAPK pathway. After CTTPPPD treatment, a significant reduction in FGFR3 gene expression was observed, which may help to reduce the risk of lung cancer metastasis. TGF-β1 is highly expressed in NSCLC patients, which can promote the growth, invasion, and metastasis of NSCLC. The CTTPPPD administration significantly reduces the expression of TGF-β1, indicating that CTTPPPD can reduce the migration and local invasion of lung cancer cells. The study revealed that the reduced expression of DDIT3 in lung cancer shortens the survival time of patients. This study showed that CTTPPPD can significantly raise the expression of DDIT3, which may inhibit the growth of lung cancer cells and diffusion. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway uses a variety of mechanisms to affect p53, one of the major cancer suppressors involved in the regulation of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and genomic stability. Closely related to NSCLC, p53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in this type of cancer. For example, Akt can directly phosphorylate MDM2 to promote MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. In addition, Akt activation can also inhibit p53 stability and activity in other ways, affecting the cell cycle and apoptosis. GADD45A is a downstream gene regulated by p53, and its abnormal expression is closely related to lung, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. The increased expression of GADD45A can significantly promote the apoptosis of A549 cells. The up-regulation of GADD45A after CTTPPPD administration may cause remarkable antitumor effects on lung A549 cells by enhancing the apoptotic pathway. GTSE1 reduces the p53-mediated tumor suppressor function by inhibiting the expression of p53. Therefore, it plays a role in the proliferation and survival of lung cancer cells. The up-regulation of GTSE1 in lung cancer patients is associated with disease progression and a reduced survival rate. It may inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells and exhibit anti-NSCLC effects. The up-regulation of SESN2 may inhibit the growth of lung cancer cells and slow down the progression of tumors by affecting the cell cycle and cell proliferation. This study showed that the CTTPPPD administration significantly increased the expression of SESN2. This suggests that CTTPPPD may induce cell-cycle arrest by affecting cell-cycle progression in lung cancer cells and, thereby, inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells.The TCA cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, is a key metabolic pathway that provides energy for cellular metabolism. The TCA cycle engages in the metabolism of glucose and also coordinates the metabolism of glutamine and other amino acids and fatty acids to ensure the effective use of intracellular metabolites. LDHA is a crucial enzyme in the process of glycolysis, and increasing its activity may lead to higher levels of lactate production. This, in turn, can facilitate the growth and proliferation of tumor cells. Studies have shown that LDHA overexpression is associated with a lower survival rate in NSCLC patients. This study showed that CTTPPPD could significantly reduce LDHA expression, suggesting that CTTPPPD may inhibit the glycolytic pathway of tumor cells and reduce energy production and, thereby, inhibit the growth of tumor cells. PGAM1 is an oncogene that activates the TGF-β signaling pathway in NSCLC to increase the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. CTTPPPD may inhibit the activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway and reduce the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells by reducing the expression of PGAM1. SLC2A1 is a transporter that mainly mediates the regulation of energy metabolism in tumors. While providing energy for tumors, SLC2A1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Studies have reported a negative correlation between the up-regulation of SLC2A1 and the overall survival of lung cancer patients. On the other hand, the downregulation of SLC2A1 expression after CTTPPPD administration may inhibit tumor growth and metastasis by reducing glucose uptake and energy supply of tumor cells. Studies have shown the expression of FGF ligands and receptors plays a major role in the development of lung cancer. Specifically, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is expressed primarily in epithelial cells and, to a lesser extent, in interstitial cells. However, a study reported the significant up-regulation of FGFR3 in bone metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma. In this study, the expression of FGFR3 was significantly reduced following CTPPPPD administration. Other studies have shown that SLC16A3 is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and is associated with poor prognosis in patients. Another study discovered a significant decrease in the expression of SLC16A3 following CTPPPPD administration, indicating that CTPPPPD is involved in cancer and is closely associated with the central carbon metabolism pathway in cancer. In this study, the administration of a certain dose of CTPPPPD significantly reduced the expression of SLC16A3. This study demonstrated the significance of metabonomics and transcriptome analysis in understanding the central carbon metabolism in cancer. It also highlighted the importance of pathways, such as Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, proximal tubule bicarbonate reclamation, arginine biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, in the anti-NSCLC mechanism of CTTPPPD.\\', \\'ref_117:Following analysis of Tan-IIA-mediated inflammatory cytokines, endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress were examined in neurons from Tan-IIA-treated HIE mice. The results demonstrated that ROS productions and GSH mRNA expression levels were downregulated by Tan-IIA in serum in experimental mice (Fig. 2A and B). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of SOD and CAT were also decreased by Tan-IIA in the serum of experimental mice compared with the control group (Fig. 2C and D). Furthermore, protein expression levels of ATF-6 and CHOP were decreased in neurons following treatment with Tan-IIA (Fig. 2E and F). These data indicate that Tan-IIA treatment decreases endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress in mice with perinatal HIE, which may contribute to reduced apoptosis of neurons in the central nervous system following HIE.Oxidative and reductive stress are essential for dynamic phases experienced by cells undergoing adaptation towards endogenous or exogenous noxious stimuli. Mitochondrial malfunction is the common denominator arising from the aberrant functioning of the rheostat that maintains the homeostasis between oxidative and reductive stress in neurons. Maladaptation during oxidative stress may have a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of HIE. Demarest et al have analyzed the correlation of mitochondrial respiratory impairment and oxidative stress in a rat model of neonatal HIE, and the results demonstrated that attenuation of oxidative stress can protect neurons against the loss of mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase activity. Evidence has also indicated that endoplasmic reticulum stress is a crucial risk factor in the pathogenic progression of HIE. Wang et al reported that notoginsenoside R1 protects neurons against neonatal cerebral HIE through estrogen receptor-dependent activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways. In the current study, Tan-IIA-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress were investigated in HIE mice. The data demonstrated that Tan-IIA may be an efficient agent for inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress in the central nervous system.\\', \\'ref_118:To verify this hypothesis, we firstly cloned this gene from callus of P. ginseng. The PgURT94 gene has an open reading frame (ORF) of 1404 bp, encoding a protein of 467 amino acids. PgURT94 protein has a sequence identify of 46.1%, 47.1%, and 44.8% with PgUGT94Q2 (UGT catalyzing C3-O-Glc glucosylation of PPD-type ginsenosides), PgUGT94Q3 (UGT catalyzing C6-O-Glc glucosylation of PPT-type ginsenosides), and PgUGT94Q6 (UGT catalyzing C20-O-Glc glucosylation of PPD and PPT-type ginsenosides), respectively. For the enzymatic activity test, PgURT94 was initially expressed in E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 1) and the crude enzymes from E. coli expressing PgURT94 were incubated with Rh1 and Rg1 as substrates, and UDP-Rha as a sugar donor. The reaction products were subjected to HPLC analysis and results indicated a product was generated in the reaction extract from PgURT94 and Rh1 incubations, which had the same retention time as the Rg2 standard. This compound was not detected in the control reaction with Rh1 and crude enzyme of E. coli strain harboring empty pET28a vector (Fig. 2b). A product was also observed in the reaction extract from PgURT94 using Rg1 as a substrate, and was monitored along with the Re standard (Fig. 2c). The structures of these two newly produced compounds were confirmed to be Rg2 and Re, respectively, by HPLC/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) (Supplementary Fig. 2) and NMR (Supplementary Fig. 3). To test the sugar donor specificity of PgURT94, in vitro enzymatic assays were performed by using UDP-glucose as a sugar donor and incubating PgURT94 with Rh1 and Rg1, respectively. To ensure accuracy of the assay, a previously reported UGT (PgUGT94Q3) which could catalyze the glycosylation modification of Rh1 and Rg1 using UDP-glucose as a sugar donor, was used as a positive control. TLC and HPLC analyses of the reaction extracts revealed that while production of glycosylated products Rf and C20-O-Glc-Rf could be detected by PgUGT94Q3 as expected, no products were detected by PgURT94, indicating that PgURT94 could not use UDP-glucose as a sugar donor (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results demonstrated that PgURT94 is a specific rhamnosylation UGT.Through functional characterization of PgURT94, the complete biosynthetic pathway of Rg2 became clear: PgUGT71A54 catalyzes the C6-OH glycosylation of PPT to form Rh1, and PgURT94 then transfers a rhamnose moiety to the C6-O-Glc of Rh1 to produce Rg2 (Fig. 1). To achieve de novo biosynthesis of Rg2 in yeast, codon-optimized PgUGT71A54 and PgURT94 (hereafter referred to as synPgURT94), under the control of two strong constitutive promoters respectively, were introduced into the chromosome of strain PPT-10, a PPT-producing chassis constructed in our previous work. Since S. cerevisiae lacks the native UDP-Rha biosynthetic pathway, AtRHM2 from A. thaliana, which catalyze the formation of UDP-Rha from UDP-glucose, was also expressed in PPT-10. The resulting strain, called Rg2-01, produced 36.8 mg/L Rg2 according to the analysis of metabolites in subsequent flask fermentations (Fig. 3a, b). The total triterpenoid production (PPD + PPT + Rh1 + Rg2) in strain Rg2-01 decreased sharply compared to that of the parent strain PPT-10 (Fig. 3b). Since the triterpenoid biosynthetic pathway is a highly NADPH-consuming pathway and the biosynthesis of UDP-Rha from UDP-Glc by AtRHM2 in the Rg2-producing strain Rg2-01 is also an NADPH-dependent pathway, we thus focused our attention on the NADPH consumption. For PPT biosynthesis, the precursor pathway from acetyl-CoA to 2, 3-oxidosuqalene requires three NADPH molecules (the formation of mevalonate from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA need two NADPH molecules and the formation of 2, 3-oxidosqalene from squalene need one NADPH molecule). Besides, two P450s that catalyze the formation of PPT from DM also consume two NADPH molecules (Supplementary Fig. 5). Therefore, the NADPH supply is of great importance for PPT production. We speculate that the introduced of NADPH-dependent UDP-Rha synthase AtRHM2 may further increase NADPH consumption and caused a reduction in total triterpenoid production in strain Rg2-01 (Supplementary Table 6). To address this issue, we utilized a NADPH-independent UDP-Rha synthase to alleviate the NADPH limitation. Several studies demonstrated that an engineered RHM enzyme (VvRHM-NRS) formed by fusing a bifunctional UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose 3,5-epimerase (NRS)/UDP-4-keto-rhamnose 4-keto-reductase (ER) from A. thaliana to the N-terminal of a Vitis vinifera UDP-Rha synthase VvRHM can be a self-sufficient NADPH-independent enzyme for UDP-Rha synthesis. VvRHM-NRS and synPgURT94 were then introduced into PPT-10 to construct strain Rg2-02. Metabolite analysis of strain Rg2-02 indicated that Rg2 production increase to 66.4 mg/L, which is approximately 1.8-fold the amount of Rg2-01 (Fig. 3b). No significant reduction in total triterpenoid production was observed compared to the parent strain, PPT-10. These results clearly demonstrate that utilization of a NADPH-independent enzyme for UDP-Rha synthesis could rescue the triterpenoid reduction resulting from insufficient NADPH supply. During screening the single clones of the construction of strain Rg2-02, a clone, hereafter designated as strain Rg2-03, was found to produce Rg2 with a production of 107.5 mg/L, which is significantly higher than Rg2-02. The synPgURT94 gene of Rg2-03 was then amplified and sequenced; a missense T-to-A mutation of the 163th nucleotide was found, which resulted in a leucine to methionine mutation at the 55th amino acid. To explore whether this amino acid mutation contributed to the enhanced production of Rg2 in strain Rg2-03, we expressed the synPgURT94 mutant (synPgURT94m1) in E. coli and performed an in vitro enzymatic activity assay. Using Rh1 as a substrate, the conversion ratio of Rh1 to Rg2 by synPgURT94 and synPgURT94m1 was 70.6% and 92.4%, respectively, which demonstrated a great improvement in catalysis efficiency by synPgURT94m1 (Fig. 4a, c, Supplementary Table 7). The improved catalytic performance of synPgURT94m1 may explain the increased Rg2 production of strain Rg2-03. The catalytic activity of synPgURT94m1 towards Rg1, to produce Re, was also assessed; significant enhancement of catalytic activity was also observed (Fig. 4b, d, Supplementary Table 7). Therefore, this mutant was used for Re-cell factory construction. Since Rh1 did not accumulate in any of the engineered Rg2-producing strains, the conversion of PPT to Rh1 may be a limiting step in Rg2 production. To address this, we introduced an additional copy of PgUGT71A54 into strain Rg2-03 to create Rg2-04. As expected, the production of Rg2 by Rg2-04 reached 147.1 mg/L, representing a 40% improvement compared to Rg2-03 (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 6). By combining all engineering strategies, the production of Rg2 increased 4.0-fold from Rg2-01 to Rg2-04. However, in our final strain, there was still more than 263.3 mg/L of PPT accumulated and no Rh1 was detected (Supplementary Table 6). Therefore, the conversion of PPT into Rh1 remains a major bottleneck for Rg2 production. We believe that the production of Rg2 could be further improved by addressing this limiting step in the future.\\', \"ref_119:The expression patterns of CaTPS genes in different hybrids of C. aromaticum and C. nankingense were investigated by conducting qRT-PCR. The TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was utilized to extract the total RNA, and the cDNA was produced using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Dalian, China). Primers were designed with IDT tool and synthesized by Beijing Ruiboxingke Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). The SYBR Premix Ex Taq Kit (TaKaRa) was used to amplify the target fragment on the PikoReal Realtime PCR System. The PCR process began with an initial step of heating the sample to 95 ◦C for 30 s to denature the DNA. A total of 40 cycles amplification were conducted, each cycle involved heating the sample to 95 ◦C for 5 s followed by cooling it to 55 ◦C for 30 s, and then heating it to 72 ◦C for 30 s. The relative expression level of the target gene was determined using this method. The expression levels of the candidate genes were measured using the comparative 2–ΔΔCT method, with the CaActin gene serving as the reference gene. One-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons (Tukey test) were conducted to compare the expression levels of different samples using SPSS20.0. Correlation analysis between the CaTPSs expression levels and sesquiterpenoids contents was performed by means of Spearman\\'s correlation coefficient using Origin software. The PubChem compound database was used to obtain the chemical structures of FPP and GPP. The structures were prepared in ChemDraw and were optimized by minimizing energy using the MM2 force field in Chem3D. AlphaFold2.ipynb – Colaboratory was used to model the 3D structures. The protein preparation wizard in PyMOL (V.2.5.4) was utilized to process the structures. Molecular docking was carried out using AutoDockTools (V.1.5.6) and autodock_vina (V.1.1.2). Finally, the interactions between proteins and ligands were analyzed using PyMOL. The amplification of the open reading frames (ORF) of CaTPSs was performed using the full-length transcriptome data as references. The specific primers used to amplify the CaTPSs are listed in the supplementary file. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1 % agarose gel and then purified. They were inserted into the vector using the manufacturer\\'s protocol (CV21-Zero Background pTOPO-TA/Blunt Cloning Kit). Then the recombinant vectors were introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α cells (Weidi Biotech). Positive clones were identified through PCR and sent to Beijing Ruiboxingke Biotech. Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) for sequencing. The subcellular localization of CaTPSs was investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts using Tape-Arabidopsis Sandwich method referenced and improved from a previous study. To create the recombinant plasmid pCAMBIA1300-CaTPSs-eGFP, the complete ORF sequences of CaTPSs were subcloned from the TOPO blunt vector into the pCAMBIA1300-eGFP vector, utilizing the In-Fusion® HD Cloning Kit (Clontech, CA, USA). The vector that was created to determine the localization of CaTPSs was introduced into protoplasts using PEG4000. The transformed protoplasts were then cultured for 12–16 h at 28 ◦C in the absence of light. After that, they were observed using a laser-scanning microscope (TCS SP8, Leica, Germany). Using the plasmids mentioned above as templates, CaTPS genes were subcloned using the primers listed in Table S1. Two linearized expression vector (pET-32a and pGEX-4 T-1) were used to create a recombinant expression plasmid by inserting the PCR fragment of target genes. The E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmids, and cultured at 37 ◦C and 200 rpm until the OD 600 reached 0.4–0.6. The recombinant proteins were induced with isopropyl-β-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 0.3 mM) and incubated at 16 ◦C for 18–20 h. Bacteria were collected via centrifugation (5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 ◦C) following induction. Next, they were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M, pH = 7.4) and sonicated for 10 min with 4 s of work and a 6-s interval between each cycle. Then, the supernatant was collected via centrifugation (8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ◦C), and the precipitate was resuspended in 1 mL of 1 × PBS buffer. The proteins were subjected to boiling with SDS loading buffer, followed by analysis using SDS-PAGE. Finally, Capturem™ His-Tagged Purification Kit (Takara, Cat# 635710) was used for rapid separation and purification of His labeled proteins. The assays for terpene synthase activity were performed as described in a previous study with some modifications. The enzyme assay\\'s standard reaction mixture consisted of 100 mM HEPES as buffer (105 μL), 500 mM MgCl2 (3 μL), 3 M KCl (3 μL), 500 mM dithiothreitol (3 μL), 50 % glycerol (10 μL) 1 mM FPP/GPP (6 μL) (Sigma-Aldrich) as substrate, and 40–50 μg protein (70 μL), in a total volume of 200 μL. The incubation of the mixtures was carried out at 30 ◦C for an hour. During this time, the volatile products were collected by a SPME fiber (50/30 μm DVB/CAR/PDMS) before GC–MS analysis. The expression product of the empty vector was used for the control reaction. Each reaction was conducted with three biological replicates. The SPME fiber used for absorbing the volatiles must be preconditioned before use. Once the extraction is complete, the SPME fiber (50/30 μm DVB/CAR/PDMS) is desorbed for 5 min at a temperature of 250 ◦C in the GC injection port. CGMSQP2010 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Shimadzu) is used for GC–MS analysis. The GC program starts at a temperature of 40 ◦C for a duration of 2 min. It then increases to 200 ◦C at the rate of 5 ◦C/min and is held there for 5 min. The carrier gas used is helium, with a flow rate maintained at 1 mL/min. The mass spectra are taken under electron ionization at 70 eV with a mass range from 40 to 500 m/z. The ion source temperature is set to 200 ◦C, and the interface temperature is set to 250 ◦C. The compounds are identified by comparing their mass spectra with the NIST 20 spectra library.Through DEG analysis, it was found that only 8 CaTPSs were significantly differentially expressed between the two hybrids. Five potential CaTPS genes (CaTPS3, CaTPS7, CaTPS8, CaTPS10 and CaTPS20) were successfully cloned. The subcellular localization of these five CaTPSs was originally in the nucleus and cytosol.Structure models of these terpene synthases and the binding mode between them and substrates were predicted. Four CaTPSs (CaTPS7, CaTPS8, CaTPS10 and CaTPS20) were found to have catalytic activity in converting FPP/GPP to terpenoids, according to the results of in vitro enzymatic characterization.This study preliminarily revealed the molecular mechanism of the synthesis of important terpenoids in C. aromaticum. It serves as a foundation for the future studies to complete the metabolic network of C. aromaticum. Cultivated chrysanthemums can also greatly benefit from the potential of these identical CaTPSs to enhance their fragrance.\", \\'ref_120:The synthetic pathways of geniposide and crocin have widely attracted researchers’ attention. With the publication of genome and transcriptome sequences of several related species, more and more genes encoding various vital enzymes have been identified. In this study, we deciphered the pathway of geniposide and crocin biosysnthesis of G. jasminoides fruit by transcriptome analysis. Transcriptome sequencing was performed at three fruit developmental stages (60 DAF, 120 DAF and 180 DAF), and bioinformatic methods such as sequencing evaluation and protein annotation were used to analyze the biosynthesis of geniposide and crocin. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs based on time series analysis showed that, the growth of G. jasminoides fruit was actually required for the catalysis and regulation of a variety of enzymes, and also involved in a number of secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, mainly including terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, etc. Previous studies showed that DXS, DXR, GPPS, and IS had been verified as key enzymes upstream of the terpene biosynthesis, and crtB, PDS, ZDS, lcyB, lcyE, LUT, and CCD had been verified as key enzymes of the crocin biosynthesis. Therefore, in this study, four putative enzymes including DXS, DXR, GPPS, and IS, related to geniposide biosynthesis pathways and the encoding genes were screened and seven putative enzymes including crtB, PDS, ZDS, lcyB, lcyE, LUT, and CCD in the pathways of crocin and the encoding genes were elucidated.This study found that there was a consistent trend of several unigenes encoding enzymes in DXS, GPPS, and IS expression with the content changes in geniposide, mainly including DN80963_c0_g1_i1 (DXS), DN67890_c0_g1_i2 (GGPS), and DN78530_c1_g1_i2 (IS). Their high expression in immature fruit suggested that they are the primary enzymes involved in geniposide biosynthesis. Terpenes are synthesized mainly based on the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway; the reported pathways for terpenoid synthesis showed that DXS and DXR are the two most critical rate-limiting enzymes in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis in the MEP pathway in many species. Five genes of DXS were found in Salvia miltiorrhiza, according to their specificity in tissue expression; it is speculated that two genes encoding DXS may be involved in terpenoid secondary metabolism. During tomato ripening, the expression level of these genes coding DXS was highly correlated with carotenoid accumulation. A study revealed that overexpression of the DXR gene in Mentha haplocalyx transgenic plants increased the contents of chlorophyll, carotene and peppermint essential oil. In plants, GPPS catalyzes the condensation of precursors to produce GPP, which is a precursor of monoterpenoids. The accumulation of GPPS and terpenoids in Rehmannia had a significant correlation, which is similar to the result in our study. We also found DN67890_c0_g1_i2 encoding GGPS, extremely significantly down-regulated in ‘T1 vs. T3’, revealed it may be highly related to the biosynthesis of geniposide. The enzyme of IS reduces 8-oxogeranial and generates iridoids that are involved in the biosynthesis of many indole alkaloids. In this study, 14 genes encoding IS were identified, and a gene (DN78530_c1_g1_i2) was significantly expressed, while another study showed 11 candidate genes encoding IS were found involved in the iridoids biosynthesis pathway in G. jasminoides.\\', \\'ref_121:We next explored whether AKBA binding enhances or impairs the enzymatic activity of MAT2A. An HPLC-based protocol was used to directly detect SAM formation. MAT2A was incubated with its substrates which were methionine and ATP, and SAM was formed and its concentration was increased over the reaction time (Fig. 3A and B). After 2 h, it almost reached maximum production. Thus we used 2 h as the reaction time in the following assays. When the concentration of AKBA in the system was increased, the formation of SAM was decreased significantly (Fig. 3C and D), indicating that AKBA inhibits MAT2A to synthesize SAM. We next investigated the capability of AKBA to modulate SAM synthesis in HaCaT cells. HaCaT cells were treated with 20 μM AKBA for 12 h, which was followed by methanol/water extraction and analyzed by LC-MS. The relative levels of metabolites in methionine cycle including one‑carbon metabolism, such as SAM, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), dimethylglycine (DMG), betaine, methionine (MET), folic acid (FLA), tetrahydrofolate (THF), 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (F-THF), and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (mTHF) were measured (Fig. 3E and F). SAM levels exhibited a significant decay at concentration of AKBA as 20 μM. While the levels of MET, SAH, DMG and betaine remained almost unchanged. The SAM/SAH ratio also decreased at AKBA concentration as 20 μM (Fig. 3E). The levels of metabolites of folate cycle, including THF, F-THF, mTHF and FLA, fluctuated somehow with the increasing concentration of AKBA, but without significant differences, indicating that the folate cycle was largely uncoupled to the methionine cycle in HaCaT cells (Fig. 3E). These data suggested that AKBA inhibited MAT2A function and consequently decreased the level of SAM and SAM/SAH ratio. To assess whether AKBA could regulate methionine cycle, we performed stable isotope tracing analysis by adding 13C-labeled methionine to culture medium with dialyzed FBS and tracing the labeled 13C in metabolites using LC-MS. First of all, we assessed the incorporation of methionine tracer into SAM with time. To our surprise, this process was very quick. Only 0.5 h after adding 13C-labeled methionine to culture medium, substantial amount of label incorporation of M + 5 SAM was detected (Fig. 4A). After 12 h, the process of incorporation of methionine tracer almost reached the plateau. So we chose 1 h as the time point to evaluate the effect of AKBA on 13C-labeled methionine incorporation into SAM and other downstream metabolites of methionine cycle. Methionine and ATP being converted to SAM by MAT2A is the only reaction to form SAM in organism, so all the five carbons of methionine are transferred to SAM. 13C5-methionine tracing in HaCaT cells revealed that M + 5 enrichment of SAM was decreased, and M + 4 SAH was increased by AKBA at 1 h (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, the consumption of M + 5 methionine was abolished by AKBA treatment (Fig. 4B), suggesting AKBA directly regulated the levels of metabolites of methionine cycle by interfering with the reaction of SAM formation. Thus far we have shown that AKBA binds to MAT2A in an allosteric site which has not been reported before and that the binding impedes the formation of SAM. Deregulated SAM causes diverse biological alternations in metabolism, genome integrity and redox status. We therefore hypothesized if AKBA primarily targeted MAT2A, the effects it conferred on reprogramming the metabolism of cells would resemble the effects of silencing MAT2A. We incubated HaCaT cells with AKBA at 20 μM or the same volume of DMSO as control for 12 h. The duration of RNA interference was 48 h using specific siRNA that targeted MAT2A or scramble siRNA as control. Metabolites of these four groups of cells were extracted by the same procedure and analyzed by a liquid chromatography, high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) metabolomics technology as one batch. We detected 1522 features in positive mode (Fig. 5A). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to evaluate the separation between the AKBA and DMSO treated cells, as well as the MAT2A siRNA and scramble siRNA transfected cells. The unsupervised multivariate analysis revealed significant differences between every two groups (Fig. 5B). Differential analysis comparing AKBA and DMSO treated HaCaT cells identified a set of 78 differentially expressed metabolites (Fig. 5C, left panel). When comparing MAT2A siRNA and scramble siRNA transfected HaCaT cells, there were 284 differentially expressed metabolites (Fig. 5C, right panel). Pathway analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst. Notably, the top metabolic pathways with impact factor ≥ 0.08 of AKBA/DMSO group overlapped perfectly with those of siRNA/control group with only one exception. These five pathways of importance including sphingolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism and purine metabolism were listed in red in Fig. 5D. Together these findings demonstrated that the changes of metabolic pattern induced by AKBA and siRNA of MAT2A were similar in HaCaT cells. One‑carbon metabolism, especially the concentration of SAM and SAM/SAH ratio regulate histone methylation, especially tri-methylation at lysine-4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) and tri-methylation at lysine-27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). So, we next investigated whether the decreased SAM and SAM/SAH ratio induced by AKBA might cause alternations in histone methylation. We profiled dose-dependent expression levels of histone methylation markers, tri-methylation at H3K4/9/27/36, in response to increased concentrations of AKBA in HaCaT cells. We found that H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 exhibited decreased methylation, with H3K27me3 exhibiting the greater change (Fig. 6A). H3K27me3 began to decrease at concentration of AKBA between 10 and 20 μM, consistent with the LC-MS data of SAM formation (Figs. 3E and 6A). We next monitored the dynamics of these markers. H3K27me3 began to decrease after 12 h of AKBA treatment (Fig. 6B). To further test the generality of this observation, we considered the response of H3K27me3 to AKBA treatment on mouse primary keratinocytes. Similar to HaCaT cells, AKBA also induced dose response and dynamic decrease of H3K27me3 (Fig. S3). It was shown that AKBA inhibited proliferation of HaCaT cells with IC50 of 27.3 μM (Fig. S2). We therefore elucidated whether changes of methylation metabolism were due to non-specific effects on proliferation. The previous CCK-8 assays were carried out at 24 h. When the duration was 12 h as in H3K27me3 assay, high concentration of AKBA (> 50 μM) only moderately inhibited proliferation of HaCaT cells (< 30% inhibition ratio) (Fig. S4A). Likewise, AKBA at the concentration of 20 μM only slightly inhibited HaCaT cell proliferation (~30% inhibition ratio) at different time points (Fig. S4B). Western blot and flow cytometry assays using Ki-67 antibody showed similar results (Fig. S4C and S4D). These data indicated that the decrease of H3K27me3 was not induced by the limited impact on cell proliferation by AKBA. H3K27me3 is a repressive marker for transcription. We next sought to determine the precise location of H3K27me3 in the genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and the consequence of gene expression by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq). We found that some psoriasis associated genes were enriched for loss of H3K27me3 at promoters, with resulting enhanced expression. Notably, adipoq and casp12 that were reported to inhibit NF-κB, tfap2b, lor, lce1c, lce1b and btc that were reported to improve differentiation, ankdd1a, gng4 and pdzrn4 that were reported to inhibit proliferation were responsive to the decrease in promoter H3K27me3 (Fig. 6C). Overall, these results indicated that AKBA-induced downregulation of SAM and SAM/SAH ratio might be predictive of tri-methylation level at H3K27, and consequently affected chromatin state and gene expression which was related to pathological process of psoriasis.We next questioned whether one‑carbon metabolism was altered in lesional skin of IMQ mice or psoriasis patients. MAT2A was the key enzyme of methionine cycle of one‑carbon metabolism and also the target protein of AKBA. We therefore sought to determine the expression level of MAT2A in inflamed skin of psoriasis. It was found that both the mRNA and protein level of MAT2A were increased in the epidermis of IMQ induced mouse model of psoriasis as well as psoriasis patients compared with their respective controls (Fig. 7A-C). We then used an UPLC-QTOF/MS based untargeted metabolomic technology to generate a profile of >140 differential metabolites of inflamed skin. It was found that principal-components analysis (PCA) of all samples showed a complete separation between metabolites from inflamed and control skin (Fig. S5), indicating IMQ could induce profound changes to metabolic profile of epidermis just like psoriasis. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of mouse metabolomics revealed that the 57 changed pathways of IMQ mice were mainly related to amino acid, hormones and sphingosine (Fig. 7D). And the 66 changed pathways of psoriasis patients mainly involved amino acids, arachidonic acid and phospholipids (Fig. 7E). As in both cases differentially regulated amino acids contributed greatly to metabolic shifting in the epidermis, we further assessed the amino acids related KEGG pathways. In the epidermis of IMQ mice, one of these pathways was central carbon metabolism which was related to one‑carbon units (Fig. 7F). In the epidermis of psoriasis patients, four pathways that were relative to one‑carbon units were shown: central carbon metabolism in cancer, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, carbon metabolism and cysteine and methionine metabolism (Fig. 7G). Furthermore, we found serine, an essential one‑carbon donor and input of one‑carbon metabolism was significantly decreased in the epidermis of lesional skin of psoriasis patients (Fig. 7H), and taurine, an output of trans-sulphuration pathway of one‑carbon metabolism, was increased (Fig. 7I), indicating an activated one‑carbon metabolic pathway. Consistently, higher concentrations of taurine were reported by independent metabolomic studies of psoriasis patients compared to control skin or serum. In addition, phospholipid metabolism was also aberrantly regulated in the epidermis of psoriasis (Fig. 7E). Interestingly, the generation of phospholipids depends on one‑carbon metabolism to provide the head group for lipids. Membrane phospholipids are one of the two origins of arachidonic acid (AA). Besides, AA and its downstream metabolites including prostaglandins, thromboxane, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE) and leukotrienes are a family of potent mediators of inflammation. Particularly, they are indicated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. So, the levels of AA and its derivatives could be potentially regarded as symbols of status of one‑carbon metabolism in psoriasis. We observed significant increase in AA, HETE and prostaglandin E2-ethanolamide (PGE2-EA) in the epidermis of psoriasis patients (Fig. 7J-L). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that one‑carbon metabolism was activated in the epidermis of psoriasis, making this pathway a potential target for psoriasis therapy. Since MAT2A was increased in both mRNA and protein level in the epidermis of IMQ induced mouse model of psoriasis (Fig. 7A and B), we hypothesized that the MAT2A inhibitor, AKBA, harbored the therapeutic potential on this model. We developed a gel formulation for topical use of AKBA on the back skin of mice pretreated with IMQ. The AKBA gel substantially improved the psoriasis-like skin phenotype in the IMQ mice (Fig. 8A). The epidermal thickness (acanthosis) and dermal cellular infiltrates were reduced significantly in mice treated with AKBA gel compared with vehicle treated controls (Fig. 8B-D). Meanwhile, the topical use of AKBA did not changed the spleen weight or body weight of either control mice or IMQ mice compared with blank vehicle, indicating minimal toxicity during the assay (Fig. S6). PCA analysis of metabolites in epidermis showed that AKBA barely changed metabolomics in normal mice skin, but profoundly changed the metabolomic pattern of IMQ mice, indicating a regulatory effect of this compound (Fig. 8E). The metabolites of methionine cycle could not be detected by this method. But we found the level of PGE2 in the epidermis was enhanced by IMQ, and then decreased by treatment of AKBA (Fig. 8F). AKBA barely inhibit COX-2, the enzyme converted AA to PGE2. So, the decreased level of PGE2 was likely due to inactivated synthesis of phospholipids caused by inadequate source of SAM. Additionally, we validated 84 genes that encode chemokines and their receptors using Mouse Chemokines & Receptors PCR arrays (RT Profiler PCR Array Mouse Chemokines & Receptors). It was found that the expression of most of the 84 genes in epidermis were decreased significantly compared to blank vehicle treated control (Fig. 8G and H). Accordingly, immunohistochemistry staining revealed that AKBA gel remarkably decreased the infiltration of F4/80+ macrophages, CD3+ T cells and Gr-1+ neutrophils in inflamed skin lesions (Fig. 8I; Fig. S7A-C). Notably, the expression of Ki-67, a marker strictly associated with cell proliferation, was dramatically decreased in the AKBA treated mice, indicating that the excessive proliferation of basal keratinocytes induced by IMQ was reduced (Fig. 8I; Fig. S7D). Together, these findings indicated that topical use of AKBA was effective in ameliorating psoriasis-like inflammation induce by IMQ. In particular, AKBA reprogrammed the deregulated metabolic profile of IMQ induced mouse model of psoriasis. Considering MAT2A was the primary target of AKBA, it was likely that AKBA regulated levels of SAM and SAM/SAH ratio to affect various biological processes which needed methyl transfer, including epigenetic regulation, phospholipid generation and so on, whose consequences involved alternation in psoriasis-related genes and pro-inflammatory metabolites.\\', \"ref_122:Terpenoids represent a large and diverse class of organic molecules, derived from adding substituents to their core building block, the five carbon isoprene unit. Many plants produce terpenoids as secondary metabolites with varying chemical and biological activities (Wagner and Elmadfa,), such as anti-bacterial (Ben Arfa et al.,; McKay and Blumberg,; Kotan et al.,), antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (Braga et al.,) and anti-fungal properties (McKay and Blumberg,; Numpaque et al.,). Furthermore, terpenoids account for the largest share of the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) to the atmosphere (Guenther et al.,; Kanakidou et al.,; Bateman et al.,). BVOCs are subject to oxidation reactions in atmospheric chemistry impacting Earth\\'s climate (Lelieveld et al.,). To explain or even predict the molecular origin of a specific chemical or biological behavior, knowledge of the molecular structure, the potential energy surface (PES), the conformational flexibility, and the internal dynamics is required.Broadband microwave spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the molecular conformational landscape and molecular structures in detail. Due to their importance in many biological processes, a number of microwave spectroscopy studies of terpenoids have been reported recently. Internal dynamics and the conformational preferences of a linear monoterpene, linalool, was published by Nguyen et al.. Of the monocyclic monoterpenes, perillaldehyde (Avilés Moreno et al.,), carvone, limonene (Avilés Moreno et al.,), carvacrole and thymol (Schmitz et al.,) were investigated with high-resolution microwave spectroscopy. Kisiel et al. studied the structure and dipole moments of camphor using microwave spectroscopy (Kisiel et al.,). In the present study, we investigate the gas-phase structures and conformational space of menthol, menthone, and isomenthone based on vibrationally and rotationally cold gas-phase microwave spectra and quantum chemical calculations.One of the primary advantages of microwave spectroscopy is its ability to obtain information about the gas-phase structure of molecules to a high precision. Nevertheless, for a complete structure determination, rotational constants from numerous different isotopologs are required. An example of such an effort was recently reported for the comparatively large molecule, strawberry aldehyde (C12H14O3) (Shipman et al.,). However, this approach remains experimentally demanding and time intensive. Another way to extract structural information from the experimental data is comparison with quantum chemical calculations. The assignment of an experimentally obtained spectrum to a quantum chemically optimized structure (e.g., by comparison of rotational constants, barrier to internal rotation, dipole moments, nuclear quadrupole constants) has given good results, even for larger molecules and complexes (Caminati,).Menthol is a monoterpene alcohol with several properties that make it a chemically and biologically interesting system. It is well-known for its minty smell and used as a flavoring agent in many different applications. Menthol is also famous for its cooling sensation when applied to skin or mucous membranes (Bautista et al.,). This property is exploited in its widespread use as a cooling enhancing additive in cigarettes, cough medicines, and antipruritics (Eccles,; Kamatou et al.,). The three chiral centers of menthol result in eight different stereoisomers, of which the (-)-enantiomers are depicted in Figure 1. The stereoisomers, (-)-menthol (1R, 2S, 5R), and (-)-neomenthol (1R, 2R, 5S), are naturally occurring in the essential oil of Mentha x piperita L. (peppermint) with (-)-menthol as its major constituent and (-)-neomenthol as an impurity. The R (lat. rectus) or S (lat. sinister) are labels that specify the local configuration at each chiral center according to the Cahn, Ingold and Prelog nomenclature (Cahn et al.,).Menthone is the ketone analog of menthol. It bears two chiral centers and hence four different stereoisomers. The (-)-enantiomers of menthone are shown in Figure 2. Menthone has a similar minty smell as menthol and also occurs naturally in peppermint oil. As with menthol, menthone is used as an odorant and within asymmetric synthesis (Harada et al.,). Both menthol and menthone also show potential as vehicles for transdermal drug delivery (Zhao et al.,; Brain et al.,; Kamatou et al.,).Both molecules are of interest for spectroscopic studies due to their chiral properties. Comprising two stereogenic centers while maintaining a rather simple structure, menthone was used for demonstrating an enantiomeric excess determination technique (Shubert et al.,). Menthol served as prototype molecule in a chirality recognition study (Albrecht et al.,). The structure of menthol has been investigated before using electron diffraction, NMR, IR spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations (Egawa et al.,; Härtner and Reinscheid,; Albrecht et al.,; Avilés Moreno et al.,). For menthone, only NMR and computational model data exist (Smith and Amezcua,).The conformational space of menthol is more complex than that of menthone due to the additional flexibility of the hydroxyl group. Menthol was extensively studied by Albrecht et al. and more recently by Moreno et al. in a combined IR and VCD spectroscopy study (Avilés Moreno et al.,). Herein, we build upon and relate our findings from microwave spectroscopy to their results. Moreover, we focus on the elucidation of the potential energy surface of menthone and its diastereomer isomenthone. Menthone and menthol share similar structural characteristics involving the lowest energy cyclohexane ‘chair’ configuration, while the low-energy conformational landscape of isomenthone retains several cyclohexane conformations.Broadband microwave spectroscopy enables the simultaneous measurement of the rotational spectra of multiple conformations, providing a wide swath of the spectrum within the bandwidth of the instrument in a single measurement. This broad acquisition is beneficial for the assignment of the individual transitions within a spectrum because recurring patterns can be identified quickly and linked to a predicted spectrum. However, the presence of several species in the rotational spectrum can impede a straightforward assignment. Therefore, we developed and used a computer program for the analysis of broadband microwave spectra and applied it to the mixture of menthone isomers (four different species). The program identifies and fits the different species within a spectrum using calculated ab initio rotational constants as initial input values.\", \"ref_123:The topic is Structural Revision and Elucidation of the Biosynthesis of Hypodoratoxide by 13C,13C COSY NMR Spectroscopy. The study utilizes 13C,13C COSY NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structural details and biosynthetic origins of hypodoratoxide. This method allows for the precise determination of carbon-carbon bonds, facilitating the revision of the molecule\\'s structure and the clarification of its biosynthesis.Based on the 13C,13C COSY NMR data, the structure of hypodoratoxide was revised, correcting earlier misassignments. The connectivity patterns observed in the spectra also allowed for the proposal of a plausible biosynthetic pathway, highlighting key intermediates and transformations involved in the formation of hypodoratoxide.\", \\'ref_124:Firstly, the antibodies were treated with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) at a mild condition to generate half-antibodies containing a free thiol group adequate for the formation of thioether with DSPE-PEG-maleimide (DSPE-PEG-MAL). Subsequently, we prepared CA IX-TPL-Lips by incorporating antibody-conjugated micelles into TPL-Lips (Fig. 2a). Incorporated liposomes were separated by Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration chromatography. The antibody we used in this study is a kind of immunoglobulin G (IgG), which contains two heavy chains and two light chains with intact molecular weight about 150 kDa. After the reduction, half-antibody with a molecular mass around 75 kDa was generated, which contained an intact antigen binding site (heavy-light chain). The generated half-antibodies were verified with ultra-high performance liquid chromatograph with accurate mass quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC Q-TOF MS) (Fig. S1) and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining (Fig. 2b). The conjugation of reduced anti-CA IX antibody with DSPE-PEG-MAL micelles (DSPE-PEG-MAL-CA IX) and the successful preparation of CA IX-Lips were also confirmed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, demonstrated by the upper shift of the band due to the change in molecular weight (Fig. 2b). Protein smears observed in the lane of DSPE-PEG-MAL-CA IX and CA IX-TPL-Lips were probably due to the lipid content in the sample, which decreased the electrophoretic mobility of antibody chains. Particle size, polydispersity index, and entrapment efficiency of the prepared liposomal TPL are presented in Table 1. After incorporation of the antibody-conjugated micelles, the particle size increased significantly compared to non-targeted TPL-Lips, from 127.2 ± 4.93 nm to 160.1 ± 0.9 nm (p < 0.001), suggesting the presence of antibody molecules on the liposome surface. CA IX-TPL-Lips showed homogenous polydispersity index values and particle size distribution (Fig. 2c). The cumulative release profile of TPL from CA IX-Lips in vitro is shown in Fig. 2d. Both non-targeted TPL-Lips and CA IX-TPL-Lips revealed similar sustained release kinetics. The total cumulative release of non-targeted TPL-Lips and CA IX-TPL-Lips was approximately 37% and 25% within 96 h, respectively. These results revealed that the decoration with anti-CA IX antibody do not remarkably influence the release profile of the liposomes. Furthermore, the CA IX-TPL-Lips were stable with no significant change in particle size and organoleptic features, such as aggregation and precipitation in 14 days (Fig. 2e).Hypoxia is a salient feature of many types of solid tumors due to the increased metabolic production, impaired removal of CO2 and the abnormal vasculature microvasculature. Since CA IX is a hypoxia-inducible enzyme controlled by HIF, we cultured the cells under hypoxic conditions to mimic the in vivo microenvironment of solid tumors. Firstly, we confirmed that CA IX was expressed at high levels on the cell membrane of A549 cells after 24 h incubation under hypoxia (CA IX-positive), while no expression was seen under normoxia (CA IX-negative) (Supplementary Fig. S2). We applied hypoxic conditions to induce the expression of CA IX in A549 cells for the following in vitro experiment at cellular level. Next, we investigate the cellular uptake behavior of CA IX-Lips in CA IX-negative and positive A549 cells using confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM; Leica TCS SP8, Leica Microsystems Ltd.). After 4 h incubation with NBD-DPPE-labeled liposomes, the CA IX modification enhanced the cellular uptake of liposomes in CA IX-positive cells (Fig. 3a). In contrast, in CA IX-negative cells, we found no difference between CA IX-decorated and non-targeted liposomes treated groups. The difference may be explained by the fact that modifying the liposomal surface with anti-CA IX antibody enhances the cell-binding affinity and accelerates internalization of the drug by immunobinding to CA IX protein. We made quantitative measurements of the cellular uptake of NBD-DPPE-labeled liposomal formulations using flow cytometry. CA IX-positive A549 cells treated with CA IX-Lips showed a prominent right shift in the cytometric analysis compared to the non-targeted Lips, suggesting enhanced cellular uptake of the CA IX-Lips (Fig. 3b). The intracellular mean fluorescence intensity of CA IX-Lips was significantly increased in CA IX-positive cells (p < 0.001; Fig. 3c). However, there was no significant difference between CA IX-decorated and non-targeted liposomes in CA IX-negative cells. This result was consistent with the result from the qualitative study. Thus, CA IX-Lips had a greater targeting efficacy to CA IX-overexpressing cells than unmodified liposomes. We then evaluated the in vitro efficiency of CA IX-TPL-Lips using an MTT assay. Following the induction of CA IX by hypoxia, the cell viability of CA IX-Lips treated group was significantly reduced compared to both non-targeted Lips group and free TPL group at TPL concentrations from 6.25 μM to 50 μM (Fig. 3d). For CA IX-positive cells, CA IX-Lips and non-targeted TPL-Lips both demonstrated a lower IC50 (14.67 μM and 29.09 μM) than the free TPL group (44.64 μM). Furthermore, the IC50 of CA IX-TPL-Lips was much lower than that of non-targeted TPL-Lips, which may be attributed to the improved targeting efficacy of the CA IX modification. However, we found no significant differences in cell viabilities of CA IX-negative cells when treated with the CA IX-decorated and non-targeted liposomal formulations at different concentrations, suggesting that the CA IX ligand played a key role in enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro. Compared to traditional monolayer culture system, the cells in multicellular spheroids are more closely similar those in vivo situation. 3D culture conditions in the spheroids contain many of the characteristics of natural tissue including the production of an extracellular matrix, a core region of hypoxic and necrotic, which is demonstrated to provide a major barrier to traditional drugs and nanoparticles penetration in solid tumors. Thus, in the present work, A549 tumor spheroids were prepared to evaluate the solid tumor permeability of CA IX-Lips (Supplementary Fig. S3). Firstly, the expression of CA IX on tumor spheroids was confirmed by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. S4). Then, in the uptake study, CA IX-Lips displayed stronger green fluorescence at different depth of A549 tumor spheroids compared to non-targeted Lips (Fig. 4). It is confirmed that CA IX-Lips possessed stronger penetration ability and binding affinity through anti-CA IX antibody modification. In this study, we demonstrated the therapeutic benefit of CA IX-decorated immunoliposomal TPL by using a mouse model of orthotopic NSCLC tumors. Many studies of lung cancer therapeutics have relied on ectopic tumor models generated by subcutaneous inoculation of human lung cancer cells into easily accessible body parts in mice. Organ microenvironment can in fact modulate the phenotype and sensitivity to chemotherapeutics of cancer cells. Orthotopic models in which tumors grow in the microenvironment of lung tissues thus provide more clinically relevant systems for the identification of novel anti-cancer drugs. Here, the orthotopic mouse model of human NSCLC was developed by injecting A549 cells percutaneously into the thorax of the mouse. The implantation technique used in this study was simple and reproducible, with an operative mortality rate of only 4%. Matrigel was used as an anchor to fix the tumor cells at the site of injection and prevent unwanted cell spread. Figure 5a shows a representative solitary tumor mass observed within the lung 56 days after tumor cell implantation. CA IX expression due to hypoxic environment within the tumor was confirmed in excised tumor tissue samples (Fig. 5b). This mouse model can provide a clinically relevant system for studying the therapeutic efficacy of TPL delivered by CA IX-Lips. Delivery route plays an important role in the treatment of NSCLC. Direct delivery of chemotherapeutics to the lung could provide a better accumulation of active ingredients in the lung and low systemic side effects. In order to maximize exposure of lung tumor tissues to the drug and minimize the toxicity to normal organ tissue, the immunoliposomal drug was administrated via pulmonary delivery. The successful establishment of A549-Luc orthotopic lung cancer in the mouse was checked by bioluminescence imaging using the IVIS® Lumina XR system (Fig. 6a) before the bio-distribution study. Subsequently, the bio-distribution behavior of CA IX-Lips was investigated in the mouse by endotracheal administration. Figure 6b demonstrates that the CA IX-decorated DiR liposomes were only concentrated in the lung, and could even be seen at 96 h. This result could support the potential application of CA IX-decorated immunoliposomes as a sustained delivery system targeted at lung cancer site. Since TPL release from CA IX-Lips could be sustained for up to 96 h in vitro, and liposomes could be observed for up to 96 h in the bio-distribution study in vivo, the tumor-bearing mice were treated with TPL formulations twice a week. In the study, we monitored the variation in bioluminescence signals of the tumor and body weight to evaluate the anti-cancer efficacy of different TPL formulations in mice with orthotopic lung tumors (Fig. 7a). Figure 7b shows representative serial images of each group throughout the experimental period from day 14 to day 42 (4 days after the last dose of treatment). The group receiving CA IX-TPL-Lips exhibited the strongest tumor growth inhibition after 8 treatment doses compared to non-targeted TPL-Lips, free TPL and the saline groups. A change in body weight of tumor-bearing mice during treatment has often been used as a marker of toxicity. In the present study, no significant variations were observed in all treatment groups relative to the control group, indicating no obvious systemic toxicity of TPL formulations in pulmonary delivery (Supplementary Fig. S5). This result also demonstrates that pulmonary delivery of an anti-cancer drug can be a very well-tolerated strategy. The lifespan of CA IX-TPL-Lips treated mice was significantly prolonged (p = 0.002 compared with control) (Fig. 7c) with a median survival time of up to 90 days, twice longer than in the control group. Although non-targeted TPL-Lips could prolong the median survival time from 45 days to 71 days, we found no significant difference between the saline group and non-targeted TPL-Lips group. Representative histopathology samples are shown in Fig. 7d. In saline treated mice, tumors in the lung were composed of large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. We observed the typical features of tumor cells with large and irregular nuclei. The group receiving free TPL displayed highly condensed nuclei and peri-bronchial accumulation of chronic inflammatory cells. In the group treated with non-targeted liposomal TPL, small tumors appeared and were composed primarily of loose aggregates of large cells with foamy cytoplasm. Mice treated with CA IX-TPL-Lips presented lower density of tumor cells compared to the other groups. Tumors in the lungs of these animals were small and loosely organized and showed abundant foamy cytoplasm. In addition, because nanoparticles are generally taken up by the liver due to fenestrated endothelia and heavy blood flow in the systemic circulation, the use of TPL could result in serious adverse events mainly associated with the liver, such as hepatomegaly and hepatic injury. We also studied histopathological changes of the liver in the present study. Only the free TPL caused slight damage to livers and no obvious hepatotoxicity was discovered in the liposome groups. This result demonstrates that pulmonary delivery decreases the toxicity of TPL to the liver. The enhanced anti-cancer effect of the liposomal groups was mainly ascribed to the fact that the liposomes could offer prolonged time and sustained release of anticancer agents in the lung by pulmonary administration. By surface modification of liposomes with targeting ligands that bind specifically to these overexpressed receptors at tumor site and simultaneously administrated via pulmonary route, chemotherapeutic drugs can be delivered to the lung tumor sites and then released to the targeted cells. The anti-CA IX antibody on the liposomes could mediate the targeting of cancer cells by specific interaction with CA IX on the tumor cell surface, and thus improve tumor exposure to the cytotoxic drug. Results from the present study suggest the application of CA IX-TPL-Lips via pulmonary delivery for effective therapy of NSCLC.\\', \\'ref_125:We investigated the in vitro cytotoxicity of TPL/NPs in different media (i.e., pH 7.4, pH 7.4\\\\u2009+\\\\u200910 mM GSH, pH 5.8, and pH 5.8\\\\u2009+\\\\u200910 mM GSH) against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells after 48 h incubation with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT). A pH of 5.8 and a GSH concentration of 10 mM in the culture medium were chosen to represent the early endosome and cytoplasm of cancer cells. All the TPL formulas suppressed proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner from 0 to 160 nM, whereas the blank NPs without TPL loading did not induce the cell viability reduction (Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Fig. S6). In media at pH 7.4, TPL/NPs exhibited slightly higher inhibition of cellular proliferation than that with free TPL, and the IC50 values of TPL/NPs in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were close to that of free TPL. However, the TPL/NPs showed much higher cytotoxicity at all concentrations of TPL exposed to either of these culture media. Specifically, the average IC50 value of TPL/NPs in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a medium at pH 7.4 was 58.67 and 72.28 nM, respectively, whereas this was markedly reduced to 20.76 and 41.77 nM, respectively, in a medium at pH 7.4 with 10 mM GSH and was further reduced to 18.11 and 34.14 nM, respectively, in a medium at pH 5.8. The IC50 values of TPL/NPs under the medium of pH 5.8\\\\u2009+\\\\u200910 mM GSH were the lowest among all the conditions tested and sharply decreased to 13.77 and 26.39 nM in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively (Fig. 3c). These results are consistent with the in vitro drug release profile, indicating that the pH-/redox-sensitive NPs facilitate drug release and efficiently kill tumor cells.Apoptosis is the main mechanism accounting for the anticancer activity of TPL. Here, we further evaluated whether TPL/NPs would enhance apoptosis in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. To thoroughly mimic the acid and reductive tumor microenvironment, we induced apoptosis with TPL/NPs at pH 7.4 without GSH or at pH 5.8 with 10 mM GSH; apoptosis was analyzed via annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining. As Fig. 4 shows, with the equivalent TPL concentration of 20 nM in a 24 h incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells, TPL/NPs produced a higher rate of apoptosis than that of free TPL at each condition. Particularly, TPL/NPs in a culture medium at pH 5.8 with 10 mM GSH induced the highest rate of apoptosis compared with that in the other cultures. The rate of apoptosis induced by TPL/NPs at pH 5.8 with 10 mM GSH was 2- and 1.6-fold that induced by free TPL and TPL/NPs at pH 7.4, respectively. Moreover, the results in MCF-7 cells agreed with those in MDA-MB-231 cells.The cell cycle phase distribution was analyzed via flow cytometry (FCM) with PI staining, which measures the cellular DNA content. As Fig. 5 shows, after 24 h incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells with 10 nM TPL, a high proportion of cells were observed in the Sub G0/G1 phase, which indicated the occurrence of cell apoptosis. This was in accordance with a previous report concerning the TPL-mediated Sub G1 phase arrest. Meanwhile, more MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly arrested in the G0/G1 phase when treated with TPL/NPs compared with those treated with free TPL. Expectedly, the TPL/NPs in the medium at pH 5.8\\\\u2009+\\\\u200910 mM GSH also induced a significantly higher G0/G1 population than that in the medium at pH 7.4.In summary, TPL/NPs exhibited a stronger proapoptotic response and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells compared with those induced with free TPL. Given the stimuli-responsive drug release of TPL/NPs, both the cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of TPL/NPs exhibited significant enhancement in response to pH/redox culture medium, suggesting that TPL/NPs would have a beneficial anticancer effect in the tumor microenvironment.The tumor-targeting capacity of HA-VE/PBAEss NPs was further investigated in 4T1 tumor-bearing nude mice. To label the HA-VE/PBAEss NPs with fluorescence, 1,10-dioctadecyltetramethyl indotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR) was first encapsulated into NPs using a similar approach as TPL, as shown in Fig. 8a. When the tumor volume reached approximately 1000 mm3, the mice were intravenously administered with free DiR and DiR/NPs. The mice were imaged using the IVIS® Spectrum scanner during 72 h postinjection period (Fig. 8b). At 72 h, the mice were euthanized, and the main organs as well as the tumors were harvested and visualized ex vivo (Fig. 8c). After administration of free DiR, the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence in vivo was sharply attenuated, and limited fluorescence could be found in tumor tissue, indicating rapid body clearance and poor tumor accumulation capacity. However, much more fluorescence over a prolonged period can be found in mice treated with DiR/NPs. Particularly, significant tumor accumulation of DiR/NPs could be observed. Even after 72 h postinjection, strong fluorescence remained in the tumor tissue compared with the inconspicuous fluorescence in the tumor in the free DiR group. This indicated that vesicles composed of HA-VE/PBAEss copolymers had accumulated in the tumor, which would contribute to the prolonged circulation, EPR effect, and tumor-targeting mediated by HA and CD44 interaction. Taken together, these results indicated that the in vivo extended circulation and tumor accumulation of TPL can be efficiently enhanced by encapsulation within HA-VE/PBAEss NPs.The combination of tumor-homing properties and dual-stimuli-triggered tumor release profiles of TPL/NPs indicated that these would work efficiently in chemotherapy. Therefore, we established a 4T1 subcutaneous tumor-bearing mouse model to further evaluate the in vivo efficacy in suppressing primary tumor growth and distant metastasis. After treatment with different administrations for 20 days, the tumor growth curves (Fig. 9a) and body weight (Fig. 9b) were measured every 2 days. As shown, the blank HA-VE/PBAEss NPs had a similar effect as the saline control group and did not affect tumor growth or body weight. However, mice treated with TPL formulations exhibited greater antitumor activity compared with that of the saline group. The tumor volume inhibition rates for TPL, TPL/NPs (0.2 mg/kg, L), and TPL/NPs (0.4 mg/kg, H) were 54.86%, 70.10%, and 84.76%, respectively. Particularly, the TPL/NPs at either 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg induced higher tumor growth inhibition efficacy than that of free TPL at 0.4 mg/kg. The TPL/NPs (H) nearly completely inhibited the growth of the tumor-bearing tissue. Meanwhile, after a successive administration of free TPL for 14 days, mice exhibited a decline in body weight, indicating the potential side effects. Nevertheless, after loading in NPs, TPL exhibited a higher biosafety profile than that of free TPL. The differences among groups on inhibition of growth of the primary tumor are shown in Fig. 9c. At the experimental end point, the tumor weight in each group had the same trend as the result of tumor volume (Fig. 9d). These results demonstrated that TPL/NPs (H) with 0.4 mg/kg TPL possessed induced the best curative effect on primary tumor and with no side effects.4T1 subcutaneous tumors have been demonstrated to be prone to inducing pulmonary metastasis. In view of the cell migration and invasion inhibition effects in vitro, the antimetastatic ability of TPL/NPs in vivo was also evaluated. After perfusing the lungs with ink gelatin solution, the pulmonary metastatic nodules were visible. A large number of metastatic nodules were observed in the lungs of the saline and blank NPs groups (Fig. 9e). However, compared with the saline group, the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules in mice treated with TPL, TPL/NPs (L), and TPL/NPs (H) decreased by 55.38%, 67.70%, and 89.99%, respectively (Fig. 9f). The number of pulmonary metastatic nodules in the TPL/NPs (H) group was markedly reduced compared with that in other conditions. These results corroborated that TPL/NPs could efficiently suppress primary tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis.To further investigate the mechanisms of proliferation and metastasis inhibition of TPL/NPs in vivo, the tumor tissues were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 10a). The H&E images indicated that the TPL/NPs induced limited cell proliferation but caused severe apoptotic damage, even necrocytosis, in the tumor compared with effects in cells treated with either free TPL or blank NPs. This result was also confirmed by the immunohistochemical staining using Bcl-2 and Ki-67 antibodies. In the TPL/NPs (H) group, the number of brownish-yellow points representing positive cells was far fewer than that in other test conditions. In our previous study, we demonstrated that TPL could significantly suppress angiogenesis, which helped to block tumor growth. Here, the expression of CD31 was significantly downregulated in TPL/NPs (H) group compared with that in other groups, indicating the higher antiangiogenesis activity of TPL/NPs. Moreover, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the tumor tissue has a close relationship with tumor invasion and metastasis. As shown, the expression of MMP-9 was uniform over the whole slice of the saline group, whereas the lowest expression of MMP-9 was observed with treatment of TPL/NPs (H). E-cadherin (E-cad) is an essential epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-relative protein that plays a pivotal role in the invasion and metastasis of several epithelial malignant tumors. Invasion of surrounding tissues and metastasis have been proposed to be initiated following the loss of E-cad. Expectedly, low expression of E-cad could be found in the saline group, whereas the E-cad expression was markedly increased in the TPL/NPs (H) group. The downregulated MMP-9 and upregulated E-cad expression indicated that the metastasis process was significantly restrained following treatment with TPL/NPs (Fig. 10b). Similar results were also observed in histological staining images of lung tissues (Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The generation of pulmonary metastatic nodules indicated that cell proliferation and blood vessel and cell migration in the lung tissues of the saline group was extremely active. However, treatment with TPL/NPs could effectively reduce the abnormal upregulation of the expression of representative proteins, including Bcl-2, Ki-67, CD31, MMP-9, and E-cad, in the lung tissue. These results were consistent with the conclusion obtained from the tumor tissue of immunohistochemical analysis.Furthermore, to validate the regulation effect on tumor growth and metastasis of TPL/NPs, western blotting was also performed to assess the expression of signaling proteins involved in apoptosis and metastasis, including p53, caspase 3, MMP-2, and vimentin. As shown in Fig. 10c and d, treatment with TPL/NPs significantly upregulated the protein levels of p53 and caspase 3 compared with those in either the control or free TPL groups. Thus, combined with the regulation of Bcl-2, caspase 3, and p53, the data demonstrated that TPL/NPs significantly induced tumor apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Additionally, the representative proteins, in the tumor EMT process including MMP-2 and vimentin, were evaluated via western blotting. Expectedly, the levels of MMP-2 and vimentin were markedly decreased in the TPL/NPs groups (Fig. 10d). In view of the regulation of E-cad, MMP-9, MMP-2, and vimentin, the results showed that TPL/NPs effectively suppressed tumor metastatic effects in vivo.Although treatment with TPL/NPs produced outstanding antitumor growth and antimetastatic effects, whether this would result in side effects remains unclear, in view of the acknowledged severe side effects of TPL. Thus, we evaluated the histological images of the main organs using H&E staining and several blood biochemical indexes. Compared with those in the saline group, free TPL-treated mice showed histopathological changes in liver tissue, characterized by fat vacuoles, inflammatory cell infiltration, poor cytoplasm and light staining, nucleus pyknosis and deep staining (Fig. 11a). This indicated that liver injury had been caused by free TPL administration. However, the severity of histopathological lesions in TPL/NPs groups was less than that in the free TPL group. Furthermore, significant increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspirate aminotransferase (AST) levels in blood were observed in mice serum treated with 0.4 mg/kg of the free TPL compared with those in the saline group (Fig. 11b). By contrast, the administration of TPL/NPs with each dosage did not lead to significant changes in the levels of these indexes. There were no significant differences in the levels of urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine (Cr) between the groups.\\', \\'ref_126:Although many reports showing that AS could be used for HS treatment. It seemed to work invalidly or only show little benefit on improving gross and histological appearance of HS. The poor response to AS treatment is probably associated with the fact that AS tablet for oral intake is a glycoside herbal medicines with low bioavailability and the adjuvant usually occupies 92% of volume with no pharmacological effects. Thus, an appropriate treatment efficacy cannot be expected from the dose regimen of clinical recommendations. As a supportive evidence of low bioavailability, LC50 and side effects were difficult to be detected. Therefore, this study used AS drug manufactured by Shanghai Modern Pharmaceutical Company to explore the oral therapeutic effect of AS on the improvement of HS gross view, histological structure, and fibrotic gene expression using a rabbit ear HS model. Because of the disadvantage of low bioavailability, the drug dose with 10‐folds (12 mg kg−1 d−1) and 20‐folds (24 mg kg−1 d−1) higher than that of clinical recommendation were applied to conduct the oral drug efficacy on HS. In addition, the transoral gavage was employed to make sure proper intake of administered drugs.In this study, none of the treated rabbits displayed obvious side effects or died after oral AS treatment at these two doses, which suggested that AS indeed had low bioavailability and non‐detectable side effects. Future research should further explore how to purify or improve the structure of AS in order to enhance the bioavailability. Based on our findings, ascending the clinically recommended dose of AS could be a safe and straightforward approach to treat HS.\\', \\'ref_127:This article is devoted to the design, study, and comparative analysis of the structure, spectral properties, photostability, erythrotoxicity, and membranotropic effect on mammalian erythrocytes of a fluorescent biomarker based on meso-carboxy substituted-BODIPY with a thioterpene fragment. The molecular structure of the conjugate was confirmed via X-ray, UV/vis-, and NMR-spectra.It is found that the conjugate exhibits a large extinction coefficient (ɛ ~ 64,000–78,000) at 498–503 nm and a high fluorescence quantum yield (φ ~ 76–100%) at 514–519 nm. The introduction of a thioterpene fragment into the meso-position of BODIPY leads to an increase of the photostability of conjugate 6 almost to ~2 times compared to the meso-unsubstituted analog. The kinetics of the photooxidation processes of the complex in solution substantially depends on the solvent nature. The observed increase in the photodegradation of dye in toluene (more than ~two times) compared with cyclohexane and 1-octanol is caused by an increase in the polarization of the aromatic system of the dipyrromethene ligand due to π–π-stacking with toluene molecules. The high polarity of DMSO significantly increases the photooxidation efficiency of the dye (more than ~10 times) compared to cyclohexane. A significant contribution to the increase in the photodegradation rate of the biomarker in aromatic and polar solvents may be due to the interaction with active radical products of solvent photolysis.The research results demonstrate that covalent binding of the thioterpenoid to the carboxylic acid residue of meso-substituted BODIPY is an excellent way to increase affinity dyes to biostructures, including blood components. The introduction of an aliphatic substituent with a thioterpene fragment into the meso-position of BODIPY contributes to a significant increase in its membranotropic properties toward mammalian RBC in the absence of erythrotoxicity, even at a concentration of 20 μM.\\', \\'ref_128:First, summarize the theme of the article in one sentence.

The molecular formula of C20H30O2 was proposed for compound 8 and was supported by HREIMS data. The relative configuration of ent-labdane 8 was assigned with reference to a NOESY spectrum. Compound 9 was isolated as a white, amorphous solid (0.3% w/w yield). The structure was assigned as the 2,17-diol based upon similarity of the spectroscopic data to compound 6. The relative configuration of ent-labdane 9 was assigned from an HSQC-NOESY experiment by analogy to ent-labdane 6. Compound 10 was isolated as a white, amorphous solid (0.009% w/w yield).

Compound 12 was isolated as a white, amorphous solid (0.06% w/w yield). The molecular formula was postulated to be C20H38O3, which was consistent with a saturated decalin unit. The relative configuration of compound 12 was assigned via NOESY data.\\', \"ref_129:The morphology of liposomes was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The liposomes exhibited a regular spherical structure with an average size of approximately 80 nm. As depicted in the figures, under the optimal conditions, the Lip@GA@AS liposomes were prepared via thin-film dispersion and sonication. The morphology of liposomes was uniform, appearing spherical with an average size of approximately 100 nm (Figure 1A). Concurrently, the particle size of Lip@GA@AS was significantly larger than that of LiP, and the surface was also smoother than LiP, which indicates the successful loading of GA and AS. The average particle sizes of Lip and Lip@GA@AS liposomes were determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS) to be 74.5 ± 0.2 nm (PDI 0.282) and 100.2 ± 0.2 nm (PDI 0.269), respectively (Figure 1B), which were consistent with the results shown in TEM images. MA was used for graft copolymerization of gelatin, converting it into a double bond-containing GelMA. The chemical structure of GelMA was analyzed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The peaks observed at 5.36 and 5.6 ppm correspond to the vibrations of the C=C bonds after acrylic acid modification, confirming the successful modification of gelatin with MA (Figure 1C). Next, the prepared GelMA was mixed with the photoinitiator (LAP), as GelMA possesses –C=C– bonds that can undergo polymerization upon exposure to ultraviolet light in the presence of LAP. Before UV irradiation, the bottle containing the GelMA and LAP mixture was tilted and the liquid surface flowed to be parallel to the ground. After UV irradiation, GelMA solidified under the reaction of LAP, and the liquid turned into a translucent solid. After tilting the bottle, the hydrogel was fixed at the bottom of the bottle and could not flow (Figure 1D).The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results depict the microstructure of hydrogels, including pore size, pore arrangement, and interconnectivity between pores. All hydrogels exhibited an irregular three-dimensional network structure, which could promote the transport of nutrients and gas exchange during the cell culture process. As important structures for drug delivery and penetration, pores affect the diffusion of drugs in hydrogels and the rate of drug release into wounds. We observed that the hydrogel loaded with liposomes exhibited a greater number of pores compared to GelMA, and these pores were also larger in size to give hydrogel a larger surface area (Figure 2A). These pores help the hydrogel adhere firmly to the wound. The larger surface area is conducive to the exchange of drugs and wound exudate and maintains good air permeability. The hydrogel absorbs wound exudate, but continuous absorption leads to swelling, causing it to detach and lose effectiveness, which is a common issue with conventionally prepared hydrogels, and poses challenges in various biomedical applications such as soft actuation, tissue engineering, bioelectronics, and internal wound closure. This swelling typically results in volume expansion, compromising the mechanical integrity of the hydrogel and potentially exerting unwanted pressure on surrounding tissues when used in vivo. Therefore, balancing the hydrogel\\'s water absorption capacity and structural damage caused by swelling is crucial to enhance the effectiveness and safety of hydrogel applications in biomedical settings. We also analyzed the swelling rates of the different hydrogels in aqueous solutions. The swelling curves indicate that both GelMA and GeLMA/Lip@GA@AS hydrogels reach equilibrium swelling within 5 h, with maximum swelling ratios of 69.8% ± 5.7% and 52.1% ± 1.0%, respectively (Figure 2B). This indicates that GeLMA/Lip@GA@AS has higher mechanical strength while maintaining its water absorption capacity. An ideal hydrogel should possess excellent mechanical properties to ensure convenience and integrity during application. The results indicate that GelMA/Lip@GA@AS hydrogel exhibited the highest stiffness. In comparison, GelMA hydrogel was softer, with rupture occurring around 55% compression (Figure 3A). The maximum compressive stress for GelMA and GelMA/Lip@GA@AS hydrogels were 57.2 and 66.3 kPa, respectively. Liposomes have their own structural integrity. When dispersed in a hydrogel matrix, they can act as a microscopic skeleton to enhance the overall stiffness and elasticity of the hydrogel. Besides, the rheological properties of the hydrogel material, as depicted by the graphs showing the changes in storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) with time, indicate that neither G′ nor G″ exhibits significant increases over time. Moreover, G′ consistently remains greater than G″, suggesting good stability of the hydrogel (Figure 3B). Upon gelation, G′ remains higher than G″ for all frequencies, demonstrating that the hydrogel maintains its gel state stably (Figure 3C).\", \"ref_130:The plant sterols ß-sitosterol and daucosterol were identified by direct comparisons (co-TLC, IR, EI-MS, 1H-NMR) with the authentic materials available in our laboratory. The El-MS, 1H and 13C-NMR data of the two flavonoids showed that they were diosmetin and isoluteolin (4), both being antioxidant and antitumor active (5-7). The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of two benzoic acid derivatives revealed that they were p-methoxybenzoic acid (8) and isovanillic acid (9). The former was found previously to be antifungal (10), and the latter exhibited antithrombic (11) and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activities (12). The aromatic glycosides were identified by EI-MS, 1H- and 13C-NMR as vanilloloside (13) and phenylmethanol glucopyranoside (14), respectively. An anticonvulsive activity of vanilloloside-containing preparations was described earlier (15). The structure of the known monoterpene glycoside was ascertained to be (1R,4R,5R)-5-hydroxybornan-2-one 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, characterized previously as a biotransformed product of camphor by the cultured cells of Eucalyptus perriniana (16). The five guaianolides were identified by the IR, EI-MS, 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra and the DEPT experiments as 3,8,8β-dihydroxyguaia-4(15),10(14),11(13)-triene-12,6x-olide (17), dentalactone (18), 10x-hydroxy-8-deoxy-10,14-dihydrodesacylcinaropicrin (17), glucozaluzanin C (17) and 8-epideacylcinaropicrin glucoside (17), respectively. Copies of spectra for the known phytochemicals mentioned above are obtainable from the corresponding author.The mass spectrum of compound 1 exhibited a molecular ion at m/z 264 which, along with the 1H- and 13C-NMR data, demonstrated that its molecular formula was C15H2004. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of 1, the presence of two exomethylene groups was indicated by a set of broadened singlets at 8 4.81 and 4.92 (each 1H) as well as at 8 4.94, 4.84 (each 1H). This observation, along with a three-proton doublet at & 1.07 and an oxygenated methine proton triplet (J = 9.0 Hz) at 8 4.26, suggested that lactone 1 was presumably a guaianolide (19). This was confirmed by the spin-spin decoupling experiment that led to the unequivocal assignments of all proton signals. As in the case of 3,8,8,8-dihydroxyguaia-4(15),10(14),11(13)triene-12,6α-olide, the presence of 3β,8β-dihydroxy groups was indicated by chemical shifts and coupling patterns of H-3x at 8 4.32 (br t, J = 6.7 Hz) and H-8α at δ 3.83 (br s) (17). This was further supported by two oxygenated methine carbon resonance lines at & 71.7 and & 63.4 arising from C-3 and C-8, respectively (17). Furthermore, the given configuration from C-5 through C-11 was assigned on the basis of the close resemblance of the corresponding 1H- and 13C-NMR spectral data of 1 to those of dentalactone (18). In addition, the ß-orientation of the 13-methyl group was also supported by the splitting pattern and shift values of the double quartet (J7.11 = J11.13 = 7.0 Hz) of H-11 at 8 2.73, and the three-proton doublet (J = 7.0 Hz) of H-13 at & 1.07 (18). In conclusion, the structure of compound 1 was established as 3,8,8,8-dihydroxy-11αH-guaia-4(15),10(14)-diene-12,6α-olide. Compound 2 was obtained as a colorless gum. The molecular formula C17H203 could be readily deduced from the molecular ion at m/z 272 in the EI-MS, as well as its ¹H- and ¹³C-NMR spectra. The 13C-NMR spectrum of compound 2 was in part similar to that of (1R,4R,5R)-5-hydroxybornan-2-one 5-0-B-pglucopyranoside (16). However, the carbon signals due to the glucopyranosyl moiety in the 13C-NMR spectrum of the latter were replaced by a set of carbon resonance lines at 8 165.9 (C), 133.1 (C), 129.5 (2 × CH), 128.4 (2 × CH) and 132.9 (CH) in that of 2 indicating the presence of a benzoyloxy group. Furthermore, the aromatic moiety was confirmed by the base peak at m/z 105 in its El mass spectrum ascribable to the benzoyl fragment. These findings, together with the \\'H-NMR data, demonstrated that compound 2 was a bornan-2-one derivative. All proton signals were assigned by comparing them with those of (1R,4R,5R)-5-hydroxybornan-2-one 5-0-B-Dglucopyranoside (16). The double doublet (J = 7.3, 4.0 Hz) of H-5 at & 5.03, along with a pair of double doublets at & 2.05 (J = 14.8, 7.3 Hz, H-6endo) and 1.99 (J = 14.8, 4.0 Hz, H-6exo), indicated that the bezoyloxy group was present at C-5 in exo-orientation (16). In conclusion, the structure of compound 2 was determined as (1R,4R,5R)-5-benzoyloxybornan-2-one. All isolates except the two sterols were tested for antimicrobial activity against E. coli, B. subtilis, S. aureus, C. albicans, A. niger, and T. rubrum. as summarized in Table 1, the new guaianolide (1) was shown to be active against E. coli, B. subtilis and A.niger with the same MIC value of 50 µg/ml, and the new monoterpene (2) against B.subtilis (MIC: 25 ug/ml) only. p-Methoxybenzoic acid, previously found to be inhibitory to the growth of Fusarium moniliforme CCMF-180 and Penicillium expansum CCMF-576 (10), was active against A. niger with the MIC at 25 ug/ml. Isovanillic acid, an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase as described elsewhere (20), was shown to be inhibitory (MIC: 25 ug/ml) against B. subtilis and A. niger. The flavonoids diosmetin and isoluteolin equally inhibited the growth of B.subtilis (MIC: 25 ug/ml) and the human pathogenic fungus T. rubrum (MIC: 50 µg/ml), respectively.\", \"ref_131:3.6. monitoring procedure for the irradiation of 2 In order to examine the irradiation time dependence of the product composition, five solutions of 2 (30 mg) in cyclohexane (30 mL) were irradiated separately for: 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min. After solvent removal, the residue was dissolved in CDCl3 and subjected to \\'H NMR analysis. The product composition was estimated from the signal intensities of the methyl groups in the \\'H NMR spectra of the following: Me-13 at 8 1.11 for 7, Me-12 at 8 1.17 for 8, Me-15 at 8 1.21 for 9 and Me-12 at 8 1.02 for 10.3.7. sunlight irradiation of 2 A solution of 2 (5 mg) in CH2Cl2 was distributed on a watch glass surface (11 cm of diameter) with circular movements. After solvent evaporation compound 2, deposited as a thin layer, was exposed to solar rays 2250 m over sea level and 19.5°N from the equator (determined with a Garmin 12MAP GPS receiver) for periods of 5 h during 3 days. The product was recovered with CH2Cl2 (5 mL), the solvent was evaporated to dryness with a steady stream of argon and the residue was subjected to H NMR analysis.3.8. molecular modeling calculations Preliminary structure refinement was achieved by using the MMFF94 force-field calculations as implemented in the PC Spartan Pro molecular modeling program (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA 92612). The molecular mechanics structures were submitted to geometry optimization using density functional theory at the pBP/DN\\\\\\\\* level using the same program.\", \\'ref_132:Aconitum alkaloids are mainly used in China and other Asian countries to treat rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disorders. However, the high toxicity restricts its clinical application. Previous studies have mainly focused on the aconitine-induced arrhythmia. However, little information is available about the impacts of aconitine on mitochondria. Mitochondria are known to have critical roles in regulating energy production and metabolism especially in high energy demanding cells, such as cardiomyocytes and neuronal cells. Emerging researches have demonstrated that the integrity of mitochondrial structure and function is essential for maintaining normal cardiac function. Therefore, we paid our attention to investigate the effects of aconitine on mitochondria and explore the relevant apoptosis signaling pathways in H9c2 cells.Mitochondrial membrane potential determined by the difference of mitochondrial inner and outer membrane acts a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial function. ROS, a product of aerobic metabolism in mitochondria, is involved in early stages of apoptosis, and triggers the loss of the ∆Ψm. PGC-1α, as a crucial coactivator of nuclear receptors, stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism. Ectopic expression of PGC-1α could result in mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dissipation of ∆Ψm could impact the generation of ATP and ROS, initiate the release of pro-apoptotic factors, thereby leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis. In the study, we confirmed that aconitine enhanced ROS generation, decreased ATP contents and ∆Ψm, and downregulated PGC-1α expression, indicating that mitochondrial damage might be concerned with the development of aconitine-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells.In addition, previous studies have demonstrated PGC-1α was downregulated in human breast cancer, colon cancer, indicating that PGC-1α may be associated with the prognosis of cancers. More recently, the expression of PGC-1α decreased was also found in human epithelial ovarian cancer and PGC-1α overexpression could induce Ho-8910 cell apoptosis by the PPARγ-dependent pathway. Contrary with the result, we found decreased PGC-1α was associated with the process of cell apoptosis, which is probably due to cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control, accompany gene mutations and become invasive. More importantly, it has been demonstrated doxorubicin decreased significantly the expression of PPARα and PGC-1α in primary cardiomyocytes in vitro, indicating that PGC-1α could involve energy metabolism remodeling and induce cells apoptosis. We speculate decreased PGC-1α may correlate with apoptosis in H9c2 cells exposed to aconitine, however, the functional mechanisms of PGC-1α in aconitine-induced cells apoptosis still need to be further investigated. Our results suggested that mitochondrial-dependent pathway is partially involved in aconitine-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells.\\', \\'ref_133:Now, our further phytochemical investigation on the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of *R. muricatus* Linn. led to the isolation and identification of three new compounds (Figure [1\\\\\\\\)](#page-1-0), ranunculoside A (**1**), ranunculoside B (**2**), and ranunculone C (**3**). It is notable that ranunculosides A (**1**) and B (**2**) are the first two *ent*-kaurane diterpenoids from the genus plants and are present in glycoside.

Therefore, only if the sugar substructure was well protected, can the free carboxyl group at C-28 be modified by various acylations. Based on our previous work, we developed a facile method to prepare the amide derivatives of β-hederin using OA, L-arabinose, L-rhamnose and some commercially available amines as the starting materials. The compounds were synthesized as depicted in Scheme 1. To protect the carboxyl group of OA, benzyl ester 1 was prepared by the combination of OA, BnBr and K2CO3 in THF-H2O with Bu4NI as a phase transfer catalyst. Compound 1 was glycosylated with perbenzoylated arabinosyl trichloroacetimidate SD-1 under the promotion of TMSOTf to produce an excellent yield of compound 2. Debenzoylation of compound 2 in the MeOH solution of NaOMe yielded saponin 3 without affecting the benzyl ester at C-28. Selective protection of 3-OH and 4-OH of the arabinose residue was successfully accomplished using 2,2-dimethoxypropane to furnish compound 4, which was combined with perbenzoylated rhamnosyl trichloroacetimidate SD-2 under the same glycosylation conditions to generate compound 5 with a 79% yield.When the isopropylidene moiety was removed to prepare the intermediate 6, the 1C4 conformation of the arabinose residue resulted produced via conformational inversion. Based on the 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 6, the J1\\'-2\\' value of the arabinose residue was changed to 1.3, much smaller than the normal value of the α-arabinosyl conformation (usually not less than 5.0). Moreover, the chemical shift (δ) of anomic C atom (109.3) is larger than that of the natural product (104.8). From the point of view of the chemical structure, the aglycone and perbenzoylated rhamnose connected with 1-OH and 2-OH of the arabinose residue, respectively, increased steric hindrance to such an extent that a chair inversion of arabinose resulted. Next, the two free hydroxyl groups were shielded by acetylation in pyridine solution to furnish compound 7, whose benzyl group was easily removed through catalytic hydrogenation to produce compound 8 without affecting the double bond between C-12 and C-13 of OA. Compound 8 was treated with oxalyl chloride to yield compound 9, which then reacted with the appropriate amino compounds in the presence of Et3N to generate corresponding compounds 10. Last, rapid and complete removal of all acyl groups in basic solution yielded the final products TS1-TS13. Fortunately, the arabinose ring returned to the normal 4C1 conformation after the final deprotection, which was confirmed by the 1H-NMR data. The preliminary in vitro biological evaluation was performed by a standard MTT assay to investigate the cytotoxicity of these saponins against five tumor cell lines: HeLa (cervical), MCF-7 (breast), HL-60 (leukemia), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), and HepG2 (liver). The synthetic β-hederin was used as a reference compound. As shown in Table 1, although most of the evaluated compounds were found to be less active than β-hederin, they showed effective inhibitory activity against at least one tumor cell line at micromolar concentrations. It is worth emphasizing that compounds with a substitution of piperazine or methylpiperazine (TS8 and TS9) displayed more potent activity than β-hederin. However, none of the evaluated compounds showed any toxicity towards the HT1080 or HepG2 cell lines within the investigated concentration range. The SAR indicated that the conversion of β-hederin into an amide yielded a moderately active derivative. The modified saponins with the aliphatic amine substructure seemed to display stronger activity than those bearing aromatic amines. Generally, the amide derivatization at C-28 resulted in highly cytotoxic derivatives on specific tumor cell lines, which means the antitumor selectivity of β-hederin was increased.\", \\'ref_135:Compound 10 (MIC\\\\u2009=\\\\u20090.0625\\\\u2009μg/mL) exhibited superior antibacterial activity against MRSA than compound 11 (MIC\\\\u2009=\\\\u20090. 25\\\\u2009μg/mL). Therefore, we hypothesised that the longer side chain of the introduced secondary amine might yield the poorer antibacterial activity, which was consistent with previously reported. When the terminal methyl group in compound 11 was replaced by hydroxyl, compound 13 (MIC\\\\u2009=\\\\u20090.0625\\\\u2009μg/mL) was obtained. We hypothesised that the strong binding ability between hydroxyl and the residue of 50S ribosomes might be the reason for the superior activity of compound 13. When the hydrogen atom on the C2 position of the pyrrole ring was substituted by nitrile and aldehyde group, compounds 17 and 18 were obtained. The MIC values of compound 17 and 18 against MRSA were 0.125 and 0.0625\\\\u2009μg/mL. The results showed that the compound containing stronger electron-withdrawing ability group relatively displayed better antibacterial activity. In order to compare the difference of compounds containing different nitrogen heterocycles, compounds 18 and 25 were prepared. As shown in Table 1, compound 18 displayed superior antibacterial activity than compound 25. The results indicated that the superior antibacterial activity of compound 18 containing pyrrole ring might be related to the strong electron-rich ability, which was consistent with previously reported. Compounds 19, 20 and 28 exhibited superior antibacterial activity. This result indicated that these compounds containing the piperidinyl group showed a better antibacterial effect. Compound 22 exhibited superior antibacterial activity against MRSA than compounds 23 and 24. We hypothesised that the introduction of methyl groups at C2 and C5 sites of imidazole increased the steric hindrance of the compounds and might yield poorer antibacterial activity. According to the previous studies, compounds were considered bactericidal when MBC/MIC ratio ≤ 4 and bacteriostatic when MBC/MIC ratio > 4. The MBC/MIC ratios of most pleuromutilin derivatives against MRSA were ≤4. Thus, most of these compounds could be considered as prospective bactericidal agents.The cytotoxicity of compounds 10, 13, 18 and tiamulin to RAW264.7 and human cell lines 16HBE (non-cancer cell line) cells were evaluated by MTT assay. The results were presented in Figure 5(a,b). At the concentration of 5\\\\u2009μg/mL, compounds 10, 13, 18 had no significant inhibitory effect on RAW264.7 cells. Under the same experimental conditions, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of these compounds and tiamulin at the concentration of 10\\\\u2009μg/mL. RAW264.7 cells treated with compounds 10 and 18 have a statistical difference compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was observed between control group and compound 13 treated group. At the concentration of 5\\\\u2009μg/mL, compounds 13 and tiamulin had no significant inhibitory effect on 16HBE cells. At the concentration of 10\\\\u2009μg/mL, lower inhibitory effect was observed on compound 13 treated group. The result indicated that compound 13 was less cytotoxic than tiamulin on RAW264.7 cells and 16HBE cells. Compound 13 might exhibit better safety profile as compared to that of tiamulin. A molecular docking study was performed to predict the possible binding mode of compound 13 with 50S ribosomes (PDB: 1XBP). Through Ledock software, the redocking of tiamulin into 1XBP placed the ligand in the same conformation as that in the X-ray structure (RMSD\\\\u2009=\\\\u20090.728). The binding free energy of compound 13 with the 50S ribosome was calculated to be −9.66\\\\u2009kcal/mol. The docking results of compound 13 show similar binding mode (Figure 6(a)) to tiamulin. The docking results presented a superimposition mode of 50S ribosomes and compound 13. Three hydrogen bonds played an important role on the binding of compound 13 to 50S ribosome. One hydrogen bond (distance: 2.5\\\\u2009Å) was formed between the ketone on the C3 atom of compound 13 (pleuromutilin core) and the residue of A-2482. One hydrogen bond (distance: 2.0\\\\u2009Å) was constituted by the amide side chain on the compound 13 and the residue of U-2564. The third hydrogen bond was constituted by the hydroxyl side chain on the compound 13 and the residues of C-2420 (distance: 2.2\\\\u2009Å). The superior docking mode of compound 13 demonstrated that it might has a stronger affinity with 50S ribosomes.\\', \\'ref_136:(−)-Menthol β-glucoside and (−)-menthol α-glucoside were prepared by chemical synthesis according to the a previously described method (Sakata and Iwamura). The chemical synthesis produced an anomeric mixture, requiring tedious column chromatography to purify (−)-menthol β-glucoside. The water solubility values of (−)-menthol β-glucoside and (−)-menthol α-glucoside were compared and found to be remarkably different (Table 1). The solubility of (−)-menthol β-glucoside in water at 25 °C was 18.1 g/L, which is 27 times higher than that (0.66 g/L) of (−)-menthol α-glucoside. This result prompted us to conduct the enzymatic β-anomer-selective glycosylation of menthol (Fig. 1).The purified BLC enzyme catalyzed the synthesis of (−)-menthol glucoside using UDP-d-glucose as a sugar donor (Fig. 2). Time-course production of (−)-menthol glucoside was quantitatively determined using LC–MS/MS in MRM mode (Fig. 3). BLC at 3 μM produced a maximum yield of nearly 58.9% in a molar ratio at 1 h. The K m and K cat for (−)-menthol with BLC were determined to be 1.74 ± 0.6 mM and 94.5 ± 2.33 min−1, respectively, in our system (Additional file 1: Figure S1). To examine the selectivity of BLC enzyme for sugar donors, menthol glycosylation was performed with other sugar donors, including UDP-d-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and UDP-d-glucuronic acid. Identical reactions were performed by varying only the UDP-sugar donor. The incubation of menthol with UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in the presence of BLC afforded new products corresponding to (−)-menthol galactoside and (−)-menthol N-acetylglucosamine, as confirmed by the LC–MS analysis (Additional file 1: Figures S2, S3), whereas no new product was detected with the use of UDP-glucuronic acid. The conversion of (−)-menthol to (−)-menthol galactoside was 1.56% in the large-scale preparation, as described in the Materials and Methods section. This result showed that BLC had a high selectivity for UDP-d-glucose as a sugar donor.After large-scale reactions followed by chromatographic isolation, (−)-menthol glucoside and (−)-menthol galactoside were obtained as white powders, and their structures were confirmed by HR-ESIMS and NMR spectral analysis (Additional file 1: Figures S4–S6). The anomeric configuration of (−)-menthol glucoside and (−)-menthol galactoside was determined to be β based on the large coupling constants of the anomeric protons at δ 4.35 (J = 7.8 Hz) and δ 4.35 (J = 7.6 Hz), respectively (Table 2). Because the yield of (−)-menthol N-acetylglucosamine was too low, the structure of (−)-menthol N-acetylglucosamine was determined using only MS/MS and HR-ESI MS data (m/z 382.3 [M+Na]+, 360.3 [M+H]+, 204.2 [N-acetylglucosamine+H] +; HRESIMS: m/z 360.2385 (M+H)+, calcd. 360.2381 for C18H34O6N). To the best of our knowledge, the NMR data of menthol β-d-glucoside was reported for the first time in this study, and (−)-menthol β-d-galactoside and (−)-menthol N-acetylglucosamine are novel compounds. To determine whether glucosylation affects the cooling sensation of menthol on the skin, topical cooling tests of (−)-menthol β-d-glucoside were performed using menthol as the control. (−)-Menthol β-d-glucoside showed a higher cooling effect than menthol (Fig. 4; Additional file 1: Figure S7) and was topically detectable at a concentration of 0.06%, whereas menthol imparted a cooling sensation at a concentrations of >0.125%. Increasing the concentration of (−)-menthol β-d-glucoside intensified the cooling effect on the skin, reaching the maximum score of 5 at a concentration of 0.25%, whereas menthol required a concentration of 1%. The in vitro skin sensitization test was performed to determine the sensitizing potential by assessing the changes in CD54 and CD86 expression in THP-1 cells using flow cytometry after 24 h exposure to a test compound (Fig. 5). Menthol and (−)-menthol β-glucoside treatments were applied at three or four concentrations of a 1.2-fold serial dilution starting at 250 and 125 μg/mL, respectively, which were the concentrations that resulted in 75% cell viability. As expected, menthol presented values >200% RFI for CD54 activation marker, indicating the sensitizing potential of menthol. However, (−)-menthol β-glucoside presented values <150% RFI for both CD54 and CD86 activation markers, indicating that (−)-menthol β-glucoside is a non-sensitizer. In fact, the sensory panel did not feel any significant irritating sensation to the skin for (−)-menthol β-d-glucoside during the topical cooling tests, whereas menthol did produce an irritating sensation.\\', \\'ref_137:Regarding the biobased polymer, the synthetic route and reaction conditions to access controlled-molecular-weight PLCO (Mn ∼ 9000 g/mol) and polydispersity (Đ ∼ 1.2–1.3) were described elsewhere (Figure 1a). Additional data are included in the Supporting Information (Table S1 and Figure S1).Before mixing components A (PLCO) and B (curing agents), the solubility of each one was tested considering the most important polar solvents used in chemistry and paint technology. Positive results were obtained in halogenated solvents, ketones, and aromatic hydrocarbons like xylene (Figures 1b and S2), with the latter and methyl ethyl ketone being the most extensively used solvent and co-solvent, respectively, in epoxy solvent-borne formulations. Xylene was finally chosen due to its relevance in the coating industry. The small amount of solvent used (0.5 mL/g of PLCO resin, Table S2) is compliant with VOC regulations. However, we do not discard the possibility to use other solvents in future works that comply with the Safety, Health and Environment (SH&E) criteria described elsewhere. As can be deduced from Figure 1c, good film forming properties were achieved with diethylenetriamine (DETA), polyoxypropylenediamine (Jeffamine D-400, hereafter abbreviated as Jeff), and polyamineamide (Crayamid 195 × 60, hereafter denoted as Cray) hardeners in the xylene solvent, whereas PLCO with PEI was not compatible. Despite the homogeneity and fast drying properties of the PLCO:DETA film, it was discarded for further assays due to its brittle behavior, attributed to the few methylene units of the curing agent. Finally, Jeff and Cray, representing commercially available and widely used curing agents, were selected to test the reactivity of the PLCO epoxy. Table S1 summarizes the main characteristics of the raw materials, and Table S2 shows the molar ratio and weight of each component in the thermoset formulation.The compositions of epoxy:hardener were defined taking into account the EEW of each component (PLCO = 216 g/equiv; DGEBA = 172 g/equiv) and the amine hydrogen equivalent weight (AHEW) of the hardeners (Jeff = 115 g/equiv; Cray = 240 g/equiv). Samples were prepared using the proportions of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 of epoxy:hardener components in order to obtain stoichiometric (1:1) and sub-stoichiometric (2:1 and 1:2) amine–epoxy thermosets. PLCO is a finely divided and stable powder, easy to dissolve in small proportions of the solvent before mixing with the necessary mass of the curing agent, which are all liquids. These mixtures were left overnight in a ventilation hood for solvent evaporation. Before calorimetry measurements, the samples were pre-cured under vacuum for 2 h at 120 °C in order to activate the initial crosslinking process and remove the entire residual hydrocarbon solvent. However, the thermal property evaluation revealed that such PLCO epoxy needs temperatures higher than 120 °C for complete curing (data discussed in the next section).The composition of the new partially biobased epoxy thermosets was examined by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR–ATR) and dynamic DSC (Figures 2 and 3). In a first approximation, the high number of polar groups of the new thermosets, originating from components A and B, complicates the straightforward analysis of the pendant oxirane groups due to the very low transmittance (903 cm–1, Figure 2a) in PLCO, when compared with that from DGEBA (917 cm–1, Figure S3). However, close inspection of the cured product, in comparison to the individual monomers, indicates that new absorption bands appear (Figure 2a). The most important are highlighted in Figure 2b. The new absorption bands are located in the range of 3200–3500 cm–1 (OH and NH stretching vibrations), at 1656 cm–1 (NH bending vibrations) after the disappearance of the NH2 absorption bands from Jeff units (1582 cm–1, Figure 2c), and by the decrease in the intensity of oxirane ring vibrations (903 cm–1, Figure 2d). Therefore, the FTIR spectra provide compelling evidence for the successful ring-opening polymerization. The analyses of the off-stoichiometric compositions were similar to that of the 1:1 PLCO:Jeff composition. The spectra of both 1:1 DGEBA:Jeff and 1:1 DGEBA:Cray cured compositions, compared to pure DGEBA, are provided as reference data in the Supporting Information (Figure S3).The degree of crosslinking can be estimated by the determination of the gel content. In this way, the swelling ratio and percent extract of the most relevant compositions of PLCO thermoset polymers were calculated by using eqs 2 and 3, respectively. As noted in Table 1, low swell ratios (∼1.5) indicate a high degree of crosslinking, which correspond to a high molecular weight between crosslinks. Thus, in this case, more tightly bound structures are present. Moreover, low values of percent extract (2–5%) also corroborate to a high degree of crosslinking. The stoichiometric compositions presented values of swelling ratio in xylene at 80 °C close to 1.5, whereas non-stoichiometric compositions varied from 1.5 to 1.7. From the percent extracts, it is possible to certify that all mixtures are well cured, presenting values of ∼92–97% of gel content (% by mass of insoluble polymer). Summarizing, the pre-curing and post-curing thermal processes were efficient and both stoichiometric and sub-stoichiometric samples are efficiently crosslinked.From the dynamic DSC assays, it was possible to determine the curing temperatures and the ultimate glass-transition temperature (Tg∞) of the new thermoset materials (Figures 3 and S4). Two heating processes were performed, and the second heating curves were used for determining the Tg∞ (Table 1 and Figures S5 and S6). The thermal properties varied significantly comparing PLCO and DGEBA compositions and well depended on the stoichiometry of epoxy:hardener mixtures.The Tg∞ values indicate that upon heating, the polymer chain mobility can be easily controlled by varying the curing agent and the ratio of PLCO:hardener composition. For example, a 1:1 PLCO:Jeff ratio renders more rigid polymers (Tg∞ 62 °C) at room temperature (r.t.) compared to a 1:2 PLCO:Jeff composition (Tg∞ 12 °C) and a 1:1 DGEBA:Jeff composition (Tg∞ 30 °C). Therefore, the constrained chemical structure of PLCs is balanced with the amine agent to offer thermoset materials with modulated Tgs. Then, enhancing the Jeff content leads to a sharp decrease in the glass-transition temperature from 62 °C (PLCO:Jeff, 1:1) to 12 °C (PLCO:Jeff, 1:2), thus giving rise to more flexible thermoset chains at ambient temperature. On the contrary, when 1 equiv of Cray is used as a hardener, the resultant polymer (i.e., PLCO:Cray 1:1) requires a similar time curing to PLCO:Jeff 1:2 to reach 100% epoxy conversion (i.e., 41 min and 37 min, respectively, Table 1), as determined by isothermal DSC (Figure 3b). For the isothermal tests, the samples were completely cured during 2 h at constant temperatures shown in parentheses in the legend of Figure 3b. After evaluation of the first heating scans in the dynamic DSC curves, at different heating rates (data not shown), it was possible to determine that the compositions with Jeffamine demand slightly higher curing temperatures (165 °C) than Crayamid (160 °C). The curing time for full conversion of the polymer through the curing period is shown in Table 1, and the curing degree of the assessed polymers is contrasted in Figure 3b.Overall, PLCO is more reactive toward polyetheramines (Jeff), and a stoichiometric ratio between these two components resulted in complete curing after 30 min without the need for a catalyst or an initiator molecule (Table 1). The addition of the curing accelerator (1-MI) did not improve the curing conversion time of the 1:1 PLCO:Jeff composition, whereas the curing time for the 1:1 PLCO:Cray mixture containing 1-MI decreased to a factor of 0.85 with respect to the same composition without the initiator. Thus, no significant improvement was observed by using 1-MI, and therefore, it was omitted in the subsequent preparation of thermoset films for further tests.It is important to emphasize that the DGEBA:Cray mixture was taken as an example of a good curing epoxy-amine material to compare the reactivity of PLCO. The shortest curing time observed for a 2:1 DGEBA:Cray mixture (11 min) was expected due to fast curing at high temperatures (160 °C). Particularly interesting is the fact that a 1:1 PLCO:Jeff composition can efficiently cure in only 30 min (100% conversion degree) after post-curing activation at 165 °C, whereas the lowest reactivity is obtained for a 2:1 PLCO:Cray combination (59 min). According to Figure 3b and Table 1, the calorimetric studies illustrate a higher reactivity for the Jeff-containing compositions than for the Cray-based thermosets as complete curing was achieved after shorter periods.The reactivity of DGEBA with Jeff is clearly higher than that of PLCO, as can be observed in Figure S6a when compared to Figure S5a, with a clear glassy to rubbery jump (high heat capacity, ΔCp). However, the lower reactivity of PLCO is not a limitation to obtain good polymeric films once the necessary curing processes have been applied. The high temperatures employed for its curing are usually applied in epoxy coating formulations used as stoving enamels, for example, in the automotive industry. Moreover, PLCO:Jeff and PLCO:Cray combinations are thermally stable with degradation temperatures starting at 200–230 °C (Td5%), whereas the maximum peaks are observed at 220–250 °C (Td,max) (Figure 3c,d, Table 1). Unfortunately, such values are about 100 °C lower than that observed for DGEBA:Jeff (1:1) and DGEBA:Cray (1:1) (Figure S6d, Table 1), proving that PLCO-based thermosets are less stable than DGEBA-based ones. Moreover, the lower Td5% achieved with Cray as a hardener (even in PLCO or in DGEBA mixtures) can be attributed to its higher molecular weight compared to Jeff (i.e., higher AHEW). Too long macromolecules with steric hindrance can hinder the epoxy reaction.The stress–strain tests were performed to evaluate the mechanical behavior of the new biobased systems, and their resistance to electrolyte penetration was assessed by means of EIS experiments (vide infra).As can be seen in Figure 4a, the stress–strain behavior of the PLCO thermoset materials varied a lot with the two different hardeners and with the stoichiometry of biobased epoxy:curing agents. The maximum tensile strengths at break found for 1:1 and 1:2 PLCO:Jeff mixtures were 27.5 ± 2.3 MPa and 3.9 ± 1.5 MPa, respectively, whereas the maximum elongations at break were 21.4 ± 4.9% and 68.0 ± 8.8%, respectively (Table S3). Such excess of curing agent Jeff, composed of mobile ether and methylene groups, imparts flexibility to the material, and this excess results in less crosslinked material; that is, PLCO:Jeff 1:2 has a gel content of 94.7% compared to 97.3% obtained with a 1:1 composition. Moreover, its rubber performance in stress–strain measurements can be predicted due to its low Tg (12 °C), below room temperature. On the other hand, Cray hardeners offered thermoset films with much more brittle characteristics (Figure 4a, inset) than Jeff, with low tensile strength and elongation at break (Table S3). The major difference in the mechanical performance is due to the chemical structure of the Cray commercial hardener. Either the formation of hydrogen bonds (promoted by amide groups) or the presence of aromatic groups (proved by FTIR, Figure S7) can favor the rigidity of the polymer network.To conclude, from the stress–strain measurements, it is possible to tune the mechanical behavior of biobased thermoset PLCO by combining different molar ratios of commercial hardeners. It is well known that an excess of hardener is associated with better substrate adhesion at the expense of solvent resistance. Therefore, compositions with twice the content of Jeff would be desirable for adhesive technologies or coil coating formulations, which need flexibility to enable the coated metal to be bent without cracking or loss of adhesion of the paint film. On the other hand, an excess of PLCO will impart tenacity and a high Young modulus to the thermoset films, which would be desirable for solvent-borne protective coatings, in stoichiometric formulations. As the present study intends to push forward the application of PLCO in solvent-borne paint formulations for metal protection, the 1:1 PLCO:Jeff composition (the highest Young’s modulus, tensile strength, and good elongation at break) was chosen for the electrolyte resistance experiments (Figure 4b). The choice for polyoxypropylenediamine (Jeff) against polyaminoamide (Cray) is also justified by its solvent-free nature and its potential to be used in eco-friendly coating preparations such as in powder coatings.Figure 4b depicts the Nyquist plots from impedance analysis using polymeric films composed of PLCO:Jeff (1:1) well cured above aluminum alloy plates (AA2024). At any exposure time, a perfect semi-circle is envisaged, corresponding to a highly resistive film. As expected, the semi-circle decreases with increasing immersion times due to the penetration of the electrolyte toward the substrate interface. After 15 h, the coating resistance (Rc) has been reduced by 1 order of magnitude only (from 1011 to 1010, Table S4), which represents a minimal loss of insulating properties of the film. Moreover, the non-ideal capacitance (CPEc, constant phase element), which is the parameter attributed to the surface reactivity, surface heterogeneity, and roughness related to current and potential distribution, remained very low (Table S4). From a qualitative point of view, the absence of a second semi-circle, which would be related to a second phase constant (σ), is a positive result. The appearance of other electrical phenomena at the metal surface, such as inductance or impedances with phase angle decay (Bode plots, not shown), is related to the presence of pitting and oxide formation on the aluminum surface.− As the substrate was previously pre-treated with a zirconium oxide passivating layer similar to phosphatizing ones, the biobased thermoset is well adhered and the penetration of the liquid does not attack the metal surface in the time interval applied.Overall, these results allow us to believe that a stoichiometric PLCO:Jeff composition is a promising candidate for coating and adhesive technologies. The electrical parameters from the EEC fitting can be consulted in Table S4.\\', \\'ref_138:CYC (50 mg/kg) injection for three days significantly increased serum ALT activity (Fig. 3a) by about 2 folds; however, no significant change was noticed in serum AST activity (Fig. 3b). Treatment with EPS caused non-significant decrease in serum ALT activity. However, treatment with 1,8-cineole (100 mg/kg) and EA (60 mg/kg) significantly decreased ALT activity by 16 and 20%; respectively as compared with CYC-treated group.Injection of CYC for three days resulted in a significant increase (about 2-fold) in the serum activity of LDH as compared to the control negative group (Fig. 4a). Treatment with the three natural products significantly decreased LDH activity as compared to CYC-treated group by 51, 46 and 42% for 1,8-cineole, EPS and EA; respectively.CYC also significantly increased serum activity of CK as compared to normal control group. However, treatment with 1,8-cineole and EA significantly decreased CK activity by 36% and 41% as compared to CYC-treated group (Fig. 4b).CYC injection caused prominent and significant depletion of hepatic and cardiac contents of GSH as compared to the normal control group. Treatment with 1,8-cineole and EPS re-normalized GSH contents in liver (Table 2). EA treatment increased liver GSH content by 36% above the normal level. In heart tissue, 1,8-cineole treatment could significantly increase GSH content as compared to CYC-treated group (Table 2).Measurement of MDA as an indicator of lipid peroxidation revealed that CYC significantly increased lipid peroxidation in heart tissue as evidenced by increased MDA content. However, the investigated compounds could significantly reduce cardiac MDA as compared to CYC-treated group. Hepatic MDA content did show significant difference in all statistically analyzed groups (Table 3).CYC induced a 4-fold and a 2-fold increase in TGF-β1 content in liver and heart tissues; respectively as compared to control negative group. Treatment with 1,8-cineole, EPS and EA significantly decreased hepatic TGF-β1 by 82, 59 and 50%; respectively and cardiac TGF-β1 by 34, 26 and 15% for the three agents respectively as compared to CYC-treated group (Table 4).Microscopic examination of liver of control group shows the hepatic lobules formed of cords of single row of hepatocytes, which are polyhedral cells with one or rarely two large spherical nuclei and a granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and blood sinusoids in-between separated from hepatocytes by endothelial cells (Fig. 5a).Histopathological investigation of liver of cyclophosphamide treated group revealed sever score, it showed dilated and congested portal tracts, with dilation and congestion of sinusoidal spaces, lymphocyte between hepatocytes and small necrotic area of hepatocytes (Fig. 5b).Sections in the liver of a cineole and cyclophosphamide group revealed mild score, showing normal sinusoidal spaces and normal hepatocytes with polygonal shape (Fig. 5c). Sections in the liver of exopolysaccharide and cyclophosphamide group showed mild score, with normal hepatocellular architecture and congested sinusoidal spaces (Fig. 5d). Ellagic acid and cyclophosphamide treatment revealed mild score, with normal hepatocellular architecture depicts hepatocytes and congested sinusoidal spaces (Fig. 5e).Likewise, histological examinations of control rats group indicate the normal structure of cardiac muscles. These muscles are striated, arranged in a linear array that branches and anatomizes in a specific pattern giving the appearance of a sheet. The cardiac muscle fibers joined by intercalated discs. They contain faintly acidophilic cytoplasm and centrally oval nuclei (Fig. 6a).The rats of cyclophosphamide group showed disarrangement of cardiac myocyte, cytoplasmic vacuolation, and degeneration of muscle fibers, pyknotic nuclei, dilatation and congestion of blood vessels (sever score). The interstitial edema and extravasation of erythrocytes without infiltration inflammatory cells or lymphoma cells were noticed (Fig. 6b). Histopathological investigation of sections of the cardiac muscle of rats given cineole and cyclophosphamide showed mild score, with relatively normal appearance of most cardiac fibers with small areas of vacuolated sarcoplasm (Fig. 6c). In some rats, the cardiac muscles showed disarrangement of cardiac myocytes (Fig. 6d). Microscopic examination of sections of the cardiac muscle of rats given EPS and cyclophosphamide showed mild score, with relatively normal appearance of most cardiac fibers (Fig. 6e). In some cases, injured myocytes with scattered coagulative changes and thin bands of contraction necrosis were found (Fig. 6f). On the other hand, sections of the cardiac muscles of rats given ellagic acid and cyclophosphamide showed mild score, with normal histological appearance of cardiac myofibres and normal nuclei (Fig. 6g).Liver of control negative group showed very occasional weak nuclear and cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 7a). In rats treated with cyclophosphamide (CYC), slightly numbers of positive hepatocytes suggesting a slight increase in apoptosis as compared to control animals (Fig. 7b). On the hand, slight decreases of caspase-3-positive cells of a liver from rats treated with ceinecole (Cin) + CYC (Fig. 7c). In rats treated with ellagic acid (EA), weak cytoplasmic and patchy weak nuclear caspase-3 expression in the apoptotic hepatocytes were found as compared to control rats (Fig. 7d). However, slight decrease of caspase-3-positive cells of rats treated with expolysaccharride (EPS) + CYC were present as compared to control rats (Fig. 7e).Positive expression of caspase-3 is rarely detected in heart tissues from the control group with very week staining (Fig. 8a). However, the cyclophosphamide (CYC) group exhibited a strong expression of caspase-3 in the heart tissues as compared with controls group. Compared to the cyclophosphamide (CYC) group (Fig. 8b), the expression of cardiomyocytes caspase-3 revealed reductions in the group treated with cinecole (Cin) + CYC, ellagic acid (EA) + CYC and expolysaccharride (EPS) + CYC (Fig. 8c, d, e).The expression of the p53 was examined immunohistochemically in the rat liver of all the groups. The liver sections of negative control rats showed few positive cells (Fig. 9a). While, the expression of both p53 in cyclophosphamide (CYC) treatment led to strong increase in p53- positive cells (Fig. 9b); these expression levels were significantly reduced by cinecole (Cin), ellagic acid (EA) and expolysaccharride (EPS) treatment (Fig. 9c, d, e).Immunohistochemistry of p53 in the heart sections from rat of control showing weakly stained nuclei of the (Fig. 10a). Rats of cyclophosphamide (CYC) group showing very strong reaction in p53- cardiomyocytes (Fig. 10b). Cinecole (Cin) + CYC, ellagic acid (EA) + CYC and expolysaccharride (EPS) + CYC treatment revealed a reduction in the expression of p53 as compared with cyclophosphamide (CYC) (Fig. 10c, d, e).\\', \\'ref_139:Various analytical tools have been developed and validated for the separation and quantification of these IsoPs, including LC–fluorescence detection, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). LC–fluorescence improves the sensitivity and specificity of IsoP after derivatization but the derivatization process is expensive, time consuming and of limited sensitivity, which makes quantitating IsoP difficult, given that biological concentrations are typically in the pM to nM range. The high sensitivity and selectivity of LC-MS/MS can overcome most of these limitations, which makes it the method of choice for the quantification of IsoP in biological matrices. Hooff et al. reported that high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection allowed the determination of FPP in human brain tissue with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 10 ng/mL. Tong et al. reported that HPLC with fluorometric detection following a derivatization process, allowed the determination of FPP and GGPP in tissues. Henneman et al. reported the direct analysis of IsoP in HepG2 cells with an LLOQ of 10 ng/mL. Hooff et al. reported a LC-MS/MS method for detecting dansyl-labeled pentapeptide FPP with a LLOQ > 5 ng/mL in human brain tissue. A LC-MS/MS method to detect FPP in human plasma was reported with a LLOQ > 0.02 ng/mL. However, this assay was unable to quantitate GGPP due to interfering peaks. Therefore, a highly sensitive bioanalytical method for determining IsoP in bio-matrices is needed to assess alterations and target the effects in the IBP. The main challenge in developing a routine quantification method for IsoP analysis in biological samples is that the concentration of these biomolecules in mammalian cells, plasma and tissue are very low and there are several co-eluting interfering endogenous isobaric compounds. Measuring all the intermediates of the IBP pathway in one procedure is a major challenge because the metabolites differ markedly in their structure and physio-chemical properties. Furthermore, chromatographic resolution is required from interfering peaks for their separation and accurate quantification. Here, we report the development of a sensitive (0.04–20 ng/mL) and accurate bioanalytical method using LC–MS/MS, which allows the direct detection and quantification of GPP, FPP and GGPP in bio-matrices without the use of derivatization or fluorescent labels. We also demonstrated the applicability of our method by quantification of individual IsoP in six different human cancer cell lines and human plasma.The mass spectrometric conditions for detection of IsoP and IS were optimized in the electrospray ionization mode (ESI). To achieve a high selectivity and sensitivity for this method, we optimized our method by comparing electrospray ionization in the negative mode and an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source. ESI in the negative mode was found to offer an improved intensity for the analytes compared to the APCI mode (data not shown). During method optimization, the mass spectra for GPP, FPP, GGPP and IS revealed peaks at m/z 313.1, 381.2, 449.2 and 356.2, respectively as deprotonated molecular ions, [M − H]−. The fragmentation of analytes and IS were auto-optimized via a product ion search of approximately 1000 ng/mL of stock solution for each analyte. The most abundant precursor > product ions for GPP, FPP, GGPP and IS were found to be m/z 313.1→79.1, 381.2→79.1, 449.2→79.1 and 356.2→79.1, respectively (Figure 2). Chromatographic conditions were optimized to separate all IsoPs of interest from interference with a desirable peak shape and signal intensity using an ACCQ-TAG Ultra C18, 100 mm × 2.1 mm I.D., 1.7 µm, column (Waters). Different solvent systems such as MeCN and MeOH with various buffers including ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate with different pH ranges, composition and different flow rates were evaluated. The suitability and robustness of the method were evaluated using different varieties of reverse phase HPLC columns ranging from 50 mm to 150 mm in length (data not shown). The less hydrophobic IsoPs including MVA and IPP eluted early and independently of the mobile phase pH. NH4OH (0.1%) was used as an aqueous and organic mobile phase modifier as a basic pH mobile phase resulted in better peak shape and a longer retention of the more hydrophobic IsoPs including GPP, FPP and GGPP. Under our final LC-MS/MS conditions, all IsoPs of interest were resolved from each other as well co-eluting isobaric interferences for target analytes in less than 10 min.IsoPs are endogenous compounds and are isobaric with very similar physio-chemical properties. Endogenous compounds not only share the same mass, but also may have the same fragmentation ion (79 is common ion representing the phosphate group), resulting in the same MRM transitions. In addition, interfering peaks could arise from other unknown endogenous matrix components. Therefore, MS/MS specificity is not always adequate for separation of all IsoPs, and chromatographic resolution is required for their separation and accurate quantification. For example, FPP and GGPP had unknown endogenous co-eluting peaks including the same MRM transition but we were able to separate them chromatographically (Figure 3). Matrix effects became problematic while performing quantification of endogenous analytes including IsoPs. Therefore, it is important to prepare calibration curves in the same or equivalent matrices as of the study samples to minimize the matrix effects. Various approaches have been reported to solve the problem of endogenous background in blank matrices for the construction of calibration curves including background subtraction, the standard addition method, stripping the matrix with charcoal, and the use of surrogate matrices or stable-isotope labeled standards. By comparing various calibration approaches, we found that depleting endogenous analytes in human plasma by using activated charcoal was the most accurate and convenient method for this application. Therefore, blank plasma was prepared by stripping plasma from the endogenous IsoP using activated charcoal. The charcoal stripping conditions were optimized to maximize IsoP depletion from plasma. A majority of the IsoP were completely depleted from the charcoal-stripped plasma, however, trace residual peaks for some IsoPs remained even after stripping with charcoal. For these IsoPs, the background peak area was subtracted from the peak area of the calibration curve standards in order to construct the calibration curves with acceptable accuracy and precision. Using analyte/IS peak area ratios, the recoveries of IsoPs in the charcoal-stripped serum were similar to those in unstripped plasma (data not shown), indicating a similar matrix effect for the study samples (unstripped plasma) and calibration curve (stripped plasma).Intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision values for the QC samples are determined in order to evaluate the method’s reliability and reproducibility. Accuracy and precision were ≤20% at LLOQ and ≤15% at the other four QC concentrations for all IsoPs in the plasma and buffer. Table 2 shows the inter-day accuracy and precision. These data confirm that the method described has a satisfactory accuracy and precision for the quantitation of all the analytes of interest. The method was validated for each analyte using three calibration curves prepared on three separate days. The calibration curved ranged from 0.04–20 ng/mL, which encompassed the relevant physiological concentrations. For reference, 0.04 ng/mL represents 0.13, 0.10, and 0.09 nM for GPP, FPP and GGPP, respectively. A linear plot of the relation between the concentration and peak area ratio was fitted using a linear regression weighted (1/×2). The calibration curve had to have a correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.998 or better for all analytes. The analytes showed no significant carry-over effect and there was no significant peak (>20% of the LLOQ) in zero samples injected after the HQC samples. The average extraction recovery of all analytes ranged from 40% to 90% in charcoalated plasma and buffer (Table 3). The LQC recoveries of GGPP were slightly low compared to HQC, however not significantly different. In addition, the extraction recovery of RAM1147 (IS) was 70.5 ± 4.9%. Our result confirms charcoal-stripped plasma to mimic human plasma with similar recovery rates using analyte/IS peak area ratios. The matrix effects calculated were in the range of 91.7% to 107.2%. Therefore, ion suppression or enhancement from human plasma was negligible under the current conditions. The results of the stability studies were enumerated in Table 4. In the different stability experiments carried out, including the long-term storage, bench-top and auto sampler, the mean percentage values of the analytes were found to be within ±15% (acceptable limits) of the predicted concentrations for the analytes at their LQC, MQC and HQC levels. The applicability of our method was demonstrated by the quantitative profiling of endogenous IsoP in six human pancreatic cancer cell lines: AsPC1, MiaPaca, BxPC3, Panc1, S2013 and Capan-1 (Table 5). GPP levels were below the limit of quantitation in Capan-1 and MiaPaca cell lines and could not be quantified. In order to find correlations among the different cancer cell lines, the mean concentrations (given in nmol/106 cells) and standard deviation of isoprenoid concentrations were recalculated in relation to the number of cells in each analyzed sample. A wide variation of the intracellular concentration for each targeted isoprenoid among the different cancer cell lines was observed. The highest concentrations of GPP and FPP were observed in the Panc1 cell lines. We also analyzed human plasma samples to measure the endogenous concentrations of individual IsoPs. The plasma concentrations of GPP, FPP and GGPP were 0.14 ± 0.02, 0.25 ± 0.09 and 1.66 ± 0.54 ng/mL in human plasma, respectively. The obtained plasma concentrations of FPP (0.25 \\\\u2009± 0.09 ng/mL) in this study were lower than the previously reported value of 1.61 ± 0.40 ng/mL, which may be due to sample variability. Previously, others have not reported human plasma GGPP levels because of the presence of interfering peaks. Our results demonstrate marked variation in the basal concentrations of FPP, GPP and GGPP in human plasma and human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. The relationship between isoprenoid pool sizes and tumor characteristics is currently not well understood and further research is needed to define this relationship as well as to determine the impact of isoprenoid pool sizes on the response to therapies targeting this pathway.\\', \"ref_140:1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded with Bruker AscendTM 600 spectrometer and CD spectra were captured with a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter (JASCO, Japan), and a Bio-LogicMOS-450.

The NMR calculations of 4 were performed using the gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO) method at MPW1PW91/6-31G**//B3LYP/6-31G* level in pyridine with PCM model. The obtained shielding constants (for both 13C and 1H) were directly analyzed with statistical evaluations with experimental chemical shifts by using DP4+ probability. The ECD theoretical calculations for compounds 1 and 3–6 were conducted using Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) at PBE0/def-TZVP//B3LYP-D3/6-31G* level by PCM model (in methanol). The ECD spectra of compounds 1, 3–6 were derived by weighing the Boltzmann distribution rate (Temperature: 298.15 K) of each geometric conformation. The ECD spectrum was generated using SpecDis (Version 1.71).The CCK-8 assay was employed to assess the cell viability of all isolates using PC 12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma). All cell lines were cultured in a medium containing 10 % FBS and kept at 37 ◦C in a humidified environment with 5 % CO2, as per the guidelines provided by the suppliers. The test compound and NAC were dissolved in DMSO to prepare a stock solution, which was subsequently diluted in the medium for use in the assays. Finally, the DMSO concentration was kept below 0.1 % during the assay. The control cells (untreated) received an equivalent volume of DMSO and were incubated under identical conditions. The EC50 values were determined by utilizing GraphPad Prism 9.5 software. PC 12 was plated in 96-well microculture plates, at 1 × 104 cells per well. H2O2 containing mediums 500 μM was used as the suitable concentration for PC 12 cells in the model. Each cell line was coculture with 50 μM of the compounds 1–20 and 500 μM H2O2 for 24 h. After the cell culture process, 10 μL of CCK-8 solution was dispensed into each well and subsequently incubated for 2 h at 37 ◦C in a humidified environment with 5 % CO2. The absorbance at 450 nm was assessed using a microplate reader. The background absorbance of the ODblank was deducted from all wells. The cell viability was determined with the following formula: Cell viability (%) = (ODcompound-ODblank) / (ODcontrol -ODblank) × 100 %. All data consist of the average results from three independent experiments. Then, under this concentration, the potential neuroprotective effects of these compounds were examined in vitro. The concentrations of isolate compounds were determined using the gradient screening method.\", \\'ref_141:4.5. general procedure for complete acetylation: compounds 15–18 Treatment of compounds 6–9 (0.05 mmol) with Ac2O–pyridine (1:2, 400 mL) for 24 h at room temperature followed by standard workup and purification by FC yielded quantitatively the acetyl derivatives 15–18, respectively.4.6. preparation of thiocarbonate 19 from compound 9 A solution of compound 9 (100 mg, 0.266 mmol), 95% 1,1<sup>0</sup> -thiocarbonyldiimidazole (165 mg, 0.879 mmol), and 4-DMAP (6 mg, 0.049 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (10 mL) was heated to reflux under Ar for 3.5 h. Then, the solvent was removed in vacuo and the solid residue was purified by FC (90:10 CH2Cl2–acetone as eluent) to give pure 19 (64 mg, 58%).4.8. acetylation of compound 20 to give compound 21 Treatment of 20 (0.05 mmol) with Ac2O–pyridine (1:2, 400 mL) for 24 h at room temperature followed by standard workup and purification by FC (95:5 CH2Cl2–acetone as eluent) yielded quantitatively the acetyl derivative 21.4.9. oxidation of compound 20 to give ketone 22 Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) (45 mg, 0.209 mmol) was added in one portion to a solution of 20 (45 mg, 0.083 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (1 mL). The resulting suspension was stirred under Ar at room temperature for 17 h. Then the mixture was filtered through a short pad of Celite and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by FC (90:10 CH2Cl2–acetone as eluent) to give pure 22 (40 mg, 89%).\\', \\'ref_142:To decipher the different catalytic functions of AoPDS and AoCAS that share high sequence identity (>79%), we first performed QM/MM multiscale simulations to probe the catalytic mechanism from the common protosteryl cation. The plausible reaction pathways are proposed in Fig. 3A, starting from the protosteryl cation, followed by consecutive rearrangements including hydride shifts and methyl transfers, and finally deprotonation that leads to cycloartenol in AoCAS, while early deprotonation from either A or B state produces protosta-13 (17),24-dienol in AoPDS. The free energy profiles from protosteryl cation to the D state in AoCAS and protosta-13 (17),24-dienol in AoPDS were determined by QM/MM molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The reaction energetic profiles are summarized in Fig. 3B, and corresponding structures for reaction intermediates are shown in Fig. 4.For the catalytic reaction in AoCAS, the 1,2-hydride shift in the protosteryl cation leads to the A state with a low barrier of 3.7 kcal/mol (Fig. 3B). The A state is unstable and is further converted to the B state through a different hydride shift with very low barrier (~1 kcal/mol). The next two steps involve 1,2-methyl transfers from the B state to D state (fig. S4) that also cross very low barriers (<3 kcal/mol). During the reactions, the aromatic side chain of F726 faces the D ring of the tetracyclic intermediate to stabilize the carbocation through cation-π interactions (Fig. 4). Accordingly, AoCAS is a high-fidelity OSC responsible for the exclusive production of cycloartenol, as validated by our further experiments (see Fig. 2).As for AoPDS, the 1,2-hydride shift energy barriers (7.7 and 3.8 kcal/mol) are much higher than those in AoCAS, and as a result, the premature deprotonation from A or B state occurs with T727 acting as a general base in AoPDS, as shown in Fig. 4. The T727 in AoPDS is located at the same position as the aromatic F726 in AoCAS. We found a water hydrogen bond chain near the T727 and stably maintained during the MD simulations (Fig. 4). This may be due to the replacement of the hydrophobic residue F to the polar residue T. Although the hydroxyl group of T is not often regarded as a strong general base, the pKa (where Ka is the acid dissociation constant) of a protonated alcohol is typically around −1 to −4, and the formation of water chain will further increase the alkalinity of T727 and facilitate the proton transfer from intermediates (C13H of A state and C17H of B state; see Fig. 3A) to T727; thus, it is reasonable to regard T as the general base [T as a general base has also been discussed in previous studies ]. The deprotonation from C17H of B state with 6.1 kcal/mol barrier (Fig. 3B) is preferable to the C13H of A state because of its barrier (13.8 kcal/mol) (fig. S5). Therefore, the most plausible transformation from protosteryl cation to protosta-13 (17),24-dienol in AoPDS is a premature deprotonation at intermediate B by T727. Accordingly, protosta-13 (17),24-dienol is the only product of AoPDS detected in our experiments. Although several different amino acid residues do exist in the active pockets of these two enzymes, the above computational modeling verified that the F (or T) in the corresponding position of 726 (or 727) is probably the main difference in the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by AoCAS and AoPDS.To confirm the key catalytic roles of T727/F726 in AoPDS/AoCAS, site-directed mutagenesis experiments were carried out and the product profiles are summarized (Fig. 5 and figs. S6 and S7). Notably, F726T of AoCAS reshapes its native function into the PDS function almost completely [99.7% protosta-13 (17),24-dienol]. Other F726 substitutions to residues with hydroxy group side chain such as T (including F726Y and F726S) will become inactive and not produce protosta-13 (17),24-dienol, while most of the AoPDS mutants, especially substitutions of the T727 position, exhibited very low activity or even inactive, thus proving the essential deprotonation role of T727 in AoPDS. The activity could be maintained to some extent in the AoPDS-T727S mutant, which is likely because of S being somewhat similar to T with comparable side chain lengths and hydroxy groups, thus further confirming the aforementioned catalytic mechanism (Figs. 3 and 4) that T727 is the key residue for production of protosta-13 (17),24-dienol in AoPDS. Regarding the other different residues in the AoPDS/AoCAS active site besides T727/F726, substitutions of V411/Y410 and V482/I481 show more or less activity loss (Fig. 5), indicating that these two positions were not related to the deprotonation and protosta-13 (17),24-dienol production. The product spectrum is sharply altered only by the F726T substitution in AoCAS. Further QM/MM MD simulations on the AoCAS-F726T mutant showed that the reaction energy profile is very similar to that of the wild-type AoPDS (Fig. 3). Therefore, T727 is the key residue, as the general base for the premature deprotonation of the active carbocation, to yield protosta-13 (17),24-dienol exclusively in AoPDS. Notably in AoCAS, F726 is a plastic residue to harness the catalytic function of AoCAS from the native product spectrum of cycloartenol to protosta-13 (17),24-dienol by a F726T single substitution. As far as we know, such a strong trade-off effect with high catalytic efficiency and specificity for a new function by a single-residue substitution has not been previously reported for the large OSCs enzyme family.Inspired by the functional reshaping in AoCAS-F726T and considering that F726 is highly conserved in most CBC-type OSCs (Fig. 6A and figs. S10 and S11), the functional plasticity of the F in other OSCs was further investigated, including ItOSC3 from Iris tectorum Maxim, SgCBQ from Siraitia grosvenorii, AjPS from Apostichopus japonicus, and ERG7 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as all these OSCs have F at the same site as F726 in AoCAS.For the strong trade-off effect of the F → T substitution, the native catalytic function of all the above four OSCs were consistently reshaped into PDS function to produce protostadienol. As summarized in Fig. 6B and fig. S12, the ItOSC3, AjPS, and ERG7 mutants were converted into PDS function almost completely (96.7, 90.7, and 99.8% protostadienol, respectively), and the SgCBQ mutant shows a nearly half production proportion (49.5%). Sequence alignment of these selected CBC-type OSCs with AoPDS/AoCAS shows that the conversion to PDS function through the mutation is not limited by a certain level of sequence identity (fig. S17), because the AjPS and ERG7 with relatively low sequence identity (~37 and 34%, respectively) and active site similarity (both with more than six residue differences) to AoPDS still produce high percentage of protostadienol by the F → T substitutions. To decipher the intrinsic mechanism behind the high plasticity of the conserved F in these OSCs, QM/MM MD simulations were used to observe the dynamic interaction modes between F/T and the protosteryl cation (Fig. 6C). In wild-type enzymes, the protosteryl cation is stabilized by the aromatic F through cation-π interactions, which widely exists as a selectivity control factor in terpene synthases. As for the subsequent rearrangements from the protosteryl cation, CH-π interaction between C17 and F726 stabilizes the transition state to promote the 1,2-hydride transfer (C17 to C20); otherwise, it would take the route with the higher barrier as seen in AoPDS and previously studied hLAS F696 mutants. While for the F → T mutants, the T supplements its hydroxy group to attract a proton from C17 or C13, causing the reactive carbocation to be quenched from A or B states. That is, the strong trade-off effect of F → T mutants is due to the supplemental deprotonation role of T, which replaces the original stabilizing contribution of F. Considering that the plasticity is commonly exhibited in the above four OSCs (all have the conserved F) and the high conservatism among CBC-type OSCs, we deduce that the specific F → T mutants are widely feasible (at least for those OSCs that yield tetracyclic products) for harnessing the new catalytic function to effectively biosynthesize the rare protostadienol.Considering that the plastic F in CBC-type OSCs is also highly conserved in CCC-type (namely, chair-chair-chair conformation of the first three fused rings) OSCs, the potential plasticity of F in the CCC-type OSCs was also investigated. We found that the stabilization/quenching trade-off effect by F → T substitution is not well reproduced in CCC-type OSCs, which was proved by several typical OSCs with different products (figs. S13 to S15). Similar to GgBAS (Fig. 7A), the activity was largely decreased and only trace amount of dammarenediol II was produced in the F728T mutant. Another reported substitution producing dammarenediol-II (oat β-amyrin synthase S728F) was also tested, and the GgBAS-N731F mutant did not obviously change the product spectrum. Instead, another notable trade-off between wild-type β-amyrin and abortive pentacyclic quenching activity was detected in the GgBAS-F728S mutant (other hydroxy group side chain residues were further attempted by F728S and F728Y mutants) and produces germanicol as the major product. QM/MM MD simulation shows that the S728 closes to the E ring of the oleanane-type intermediate (especially C18 and C19) for deprotonation rather than the D ring (Fig. 7B). Because mutants of the same position bring nonuniform enzymatic activity in CCC-type OSCs and the functional trade-off is not as strong as observed in CBC-type OSCs, the diverse trade-off effects found in CCC-type OSC mutants might also be a good initial point for functional reshaping but requires further extensive studies. In addition, similar protostadienol products are yielded both in AoPDS (this work) and in previously reported AfPDS; but as obviously shown in Fig. 7C, the AoPDS has high similarity with plant CAS and is unique from the AfPDS, which is closer to fungal lanosterol synthase (LAS). This reminds us that the mutant of AoCAS/ItOSC3 and ERG7 (also belong to CAS or LAS family, respectively) shows much higher protostadienol product rate (>96%) than that in others (such as SgCBQ; <50%), as shown in Fig. 6B. Considering that F is highly conserved at the same position while the appearance of T is unique (only found in AoPDS), the plastic F → T substitution likely causes a universal activity trade-off in many other CBC-type OSCs especially for CAS and LAS in plant.In this work, inspired by deciphering the enzymatic catalytic mechanism for the unique A. orientale oxidosqualene cyclases (AoPDS and AoCAS), we found that the specific F → T substitution is a controllable factor to extensively produce protostadienol in CBC-type OSCs. It is remarkable that the uniform functional trade-off could be facilely realized by a single substitution, which will be instructive for other enzyme engineering, by combing multiscale simulations to reveal the plastic position with mutagenesis experiments to further validate its feasibility.\\', \\'ref_143:CCTP conjugate was synthesized through covalent attachment from TP and CC with a succinate as linker that can be cleaved to release a parent TP under physiological conditions (Lee et al.,; Safavy et al.,). CCTP was characterized by IR spectrum, which showed corresponding peaks to both TP and CC (Figure 1). The UV spectrum of CCTP revealed that the conjugate contained 4∼ wt % TP and had much greater water solubility (5\\\\u2009mg/mL) than the native TP (∼17\\\\u2009μg/mL). The results indicated that the conjugation of TP to CC effectively improved water solubility of TP.In vitro drug release from the conjugate analysis described the stabilities and controlled release ability of TP from CCTP in cell culture medium, mouse serum, SGF and SIF, respectively (Figure 2). When HPLC was used to detect the free TP, we found that the retention time of the free TP released from the conjugate was consistent with that of the parent TP, which suggested the ester bonds on linking group of CCTP were cleaved by some kind of ester hydrolytic catalyst in those solutions. The similar extent of TP release from the conjugate was observed within 12\\\\u2009h for SIF (27.4%) and plasma (29.5%), respectively. Only ∼5.9% of TP was released from CCTP at 3\\\\u2009h post-incubation in SGF, whereas great amounts of drug release were observed in cell culture medium (∼38%). The results indicated that CCTP conjugate is relatively stable in SGF with gastric acid and propepsin, while it is very easy to hydrolyze in cell culture medium with complex components, including serum, amino acids, vitamins, and so on. Considering the transit time in stomach (about 3\\\\u2009h), TP release in SGF would seem insubstantial. Overall, the drug release analysis indicates clearly that most of TP release does not take place under gastric environment, but may mainly happen during or after uptake by the intestine and transport to the blood capillary.Figure 3 shows the in vitro cytotoxicity of TP and CCTP against human pancreatic cancer cell (BxPC-3) and hepatic cell (HL7702), respectively. The IC50 values of TP and CCTP are 38.22\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.52 vs 110.74\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.35\\\\u2009nmol/L for BxPC-3 and 24.04\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.71 vs 154.27\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.9\\\\u2009nmol/L for HL7702, respectively. A slight activity loss for BxPC-3 cell by less than 3 fold and a cytotoxicity decrease for hepatic cell (HL7702) by more than 6 fold were observed with CCTP conjugate form, which could be accounted for the gradual release of TP from the conjugate through cleavage of the succinate linker between CC and TP. In addition, the cell inhibition rates of TP and CCTP (380\\\\u2009nmol/L of TP) were the same in HL7702 cell groups, which indicated that the TP were almost released from the CCTP. These data suggest that CCTP can reduce toxicity and other side effects in inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation.The effect of the drug delivery system on TP-induced apoptosis in human PC cells was tested by a flow cytometric method, as shown in Figure 4. The in vitro experiments showed that the early apoptosis rates gradually decreased from 26.7%, 25.3% to 22.2% and the late-stage apoptosis rates increased from 37.5%, 54.9%, to 66.9% after treatment with 55.5\\\\u2009nmol/L, 111\\\\u2009nmol/L, and 222\\\\u2009nmol/L of TP, respectively, for 24\\\\u2009h (Figure 4(A–C)). This suggests that TP induces BxPC-3 cell apoptosis and causes a significant increase in cell apoptosis with a concentration-dependent manner. After incubation with CCTP (at equivalent TP concentrations) for 24\\\\u2009h, the apoptosis rates of PC cells were decreased from 7.43%, 7.0% to 6.5% (at early apoptosis stage), and increased from 29.2%, 34.9% to 40.0% (at late apoptosis stage) (Figure 4(D–F)). The flow cytometry data revealed that under the same conditions the apoptotic cells were less in CCTP group than those in TP group. The results indicated that the drug delivery system had delay effects on TP-induced cell apoptosis.In vivo toxicities of TP and CCTP were compared by using normal BALB/c mice that were evaluated by monitoring body weight change and hematological toxicity (Figure 5). Previous experiments showed that the minimum lethal dose of mice was about 0.5\\\\u2009mg TP/kg. Here, a safe dose of free TP of 0.2\\\\u2009mg/kg was adopted for mice in toxicity assay. There was no difference in body weight between CCTP and control group, whereas TP group showed diminution of body weight of about 30.3% during oral administration period (Figure 5). In addition, TP group showed severe hematological toxicity in terms of a decrease in the number of neutrophil over 45%. In contrast, CCTP group exhibited a slight decrease of red blood cells, white blood cells and neutrophil (Table 1). We speculate that the significant toxicity attenuation should be attributed to the gradual or sustained release of TP from CCTP conjugate into blood stream after oral administration.Increased serum BUN and Crea concentrations indicated the kidney dysfunction (Table 2). Significant increase of BUN indicated the histomorphological changes including dilation of kidney proximal tubules (Liu et al.,). Here, high dose of CCTP and TP groups had higher BUN and Crea than the control group (p\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.05), while middle dose of CCTP showed moderate effects on BUN and Crea. There were no significant differences in BUN and Crea between low dose of CCTP and control groups (p\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.05). Compared to the control group, TP group showed great increase of both AST and ALT, indicating the occurrence of liver injury. For low and middle doses of CCTP, both groups showed no significant elevation (p\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.05). However, by increasing the dose to 0.8\\\\u2009mg TP equivalent/kg, the CCTP group showed that both ALT and AST were elevated to some extent, compared to the control group. The results demonstrated that the TP treatment was associated with nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. In addition, as the dose increase, CCTP showed increasing toxicity associated with kidney and liver. The CCTP group underwent mild elevation in BUN, Crea, AST and ALT levels, indicating that the incidence of CCTP induced kidney and liver toxicity is very low.The antitumor efficacy of CCTP in human PC xenograft models were evaluated by monitoring tumor growth and body weight change (Figure 6). CCTP (0.8\\\\u2009mg TP equivalent/kg) substantially inhibited the tumor growth of 85.49% in comparison with control group on day 19, which is better than antitumor efficacy in TP (0.2\\\\u2009mg/kg), exhibiting tumor growth inhibition of 65.35% (Figure 6(A)). CCTP (0.4\\\\u2009mg TP equivalent/kg) also showed the tumor growth inhibition of 53.51% (p\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.05), whereas the same antitumor activity was observed with CCTP (0.2\\\\u2009mg TP equivalent/kg). The body weight change may reflect the complex effects of tumor progression and drug toxicity (Figure 6(B)). The control group showed a marked weight loss for up to 19\\\\u2009days, indicating the tumor progression was the major factor of weight loss. The low dose of CCTP (0.2\\\\u2009mg TP equivalent/kg) group showed a slight difference of weight loss as compared to the control group (p\\\\u2009>\\\\u2009.05). In contrast, the medium and high doses of CCTP groups exhibited a slight weight increase, indicating the toxicity and antitumor efficacy of the conjugate were correlated with the dosage. However, TP (0.2\\\\u2009mg/kg) group kept the body weight relatively constant when compared to the control group. The results indicate that CCTP is comparably effective in inhibiting tumor growth but is much less toxic compared to TP. We think that the controlled release of CCTP conjugate maintains a long-term equilibrium concentration of TP in vivo, which can enhance the efficacy of CCTP and the biological safety.Figure 7 represents an optical micrograph of liver, kidneys, and tumor tissue of mice treated with saline, TP, and CCTP, respectively. In the saline group, tumors were composed of dense cells with large and regular nuclei. The TP group showed a lot of cancer cell necrosis, indicating TP with good effect for inhibiting cancer cells. The group treated with CCTP displayed a wide range of cancer cell necrosis and a lot of cancer cells undergo apoptosis, scattered focal cancer cell nests arranged in gland tube-like. Especially the high dose CCTP group exhibited superior anticancer efficacy compared to TP group, which should be attributed to CC polymer provide CCTP an approach to achieve controlled release of TP and high water solubility. Histopathological changes in liver and kidneys were discovered in TP and CCTP groups. Fatty degeneration in the hepatocytes and obvious kidney proximal tubular dilation were observed in mice after oral administration of TP (Figure 7). However, in the CCTP groups at the low, medium, and high dose, no apparent changes were found, which is also consistent with the hematological toxicity results.\\', \\'ref_144:The particle size of Cela/Ce6/GCTR PMs detected by DLS was 163.63 ± 4.46 nm with a PDI of 0.15 ± 0.01. The Zeta potential was −23.63 ± 0.25 mV. The DL and EE were 34.33 ± 3.51% and 95.93 ± 8.21% for Cela and 26.43 ± 2.29% and 73.94 ± 5.21% for Ce6, respectively. The Cela/Ce6/GCTR PMs were observed as round spheres via TEM. After 0.1 mmol/L H2O2 treatment, the PMs boundary was blurred and disrupted, and the particle size increased. After NIR irradiation, almost no round spherical PMs were observed. DSC results showed no significant peaks in the PMs, indicating successful encapsulation of Cela and Ce6. The in vitro ROS production was confirmed by DPBF absorption changes, showing ROS generation under NIR irradiation, which promotes PM depolymerization.CLSM demonstrated preferential uptake of Cela/Ce6/GCTR PMs by HepG2 and BEL-7402 cells (green fluorescence) but not L-02 cells. NIR irradiation increased ROS levels 2.93-fold in PM-treated HepG2 cells. NAC pretreatment reduced cytotoxicity, confirming ROS-dependent drug release. Free Cela non-selectively inhibited all cell lines, while PMs targeted hepatoma cells (HepG2 viability: 52.02% with NIR vs. 71.21% without). Ce6+NIR showed strong cytotoxicity (2.24-fold lower HepG2 survival at 48 h). PMs combined with PDT exhibited synergistic effects, with 4.80-fold lower HepG2 viability at 72 h vs. non-NIR groups.In vivo imaging showed tumor accumulation of PMs (peak at 4 h), with prolonged fluorescence vs. free Ce6. Pharmacokinetics revealed PMs extended Cela T1/2 from 8.95 h (free) to 43.87 h, with 4.19-fold higher AUC. Ce6 AUC increased 33.08-fold in PMs. Tissue distribution showed PMs reduced cardiac/lung accumulation while enhancing liver/tumor targeting (8108.80 ng/g Cela at 6 h post-NIR). Te values for tumor were 3.27-fold (Cela) and 1.88-fold (Ce6) higher than free drugs. Kidney Te values were 0.0003x (Cela) and 0.003x (Ce6) of free drugs, minimizing off-target toxicity.In H22 tumor models, Cela/Ce6/GCTR PMs+NIR showed superior inhibition (tumor volume 2.22x baseline vs. 6.75x control) and 66.95% inhibition rate. PMs mitigated weight loss vs. free Cela (+16% vs. -6%). Organ indexes and H&E staining confirmed reduced hepatotoxicity (normal ALT/AST) vs. free Cela. Serum αFP (0.84 ng/mL) and VEGF (42.69 pg/mL) levels were lowest in PM+NIR group. CD34 staining showed MVD of 10.00 (PMs+NIR) vs. 49.94 (control), indicating anti-angiogenesis. Western blot revealed upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2/VEGF, confirming apoptosis induction and angiogenesis inhibition.\\', \\'ref_145:CL-promoted DNA cleavage by topoisomerase IV occurred at specific sites (Figure 2C) and could not be reversed by prior incubation with high salt or high temperature, in contrast to CPF-promoted cleavage that occurred at a different spectrum of sites and was completely reversible (Figure 4). Within the 260 CL-stimulated strand scission sites that we identified and sequenced, we distinguished two subsets: complementary sites arising from double-strand breaks and non-complementary sites resulting from single-stranded DNA breakage. Statistical analysis of base frequency deviations from expectation showed in both cases an overwhelming preference for G at the cleavage site (position −1) (Figure 3). The complementary set, where sites were analysed independently for the forward and reverse sequences, attested also to a comparable preference for C at position +5, indicating that the vast majority of complementary sites bear a −1 G at the cleavage site on both complementary strands. On the other hand, the non-complementary set of sites lacked this symmetry and exhibited −1 G only on the cut strand. All CL-stimulated cleavage sites were found fully irreversible upon heat or salt treatment.These results obtained with the bacterial topoisomerase IV are significantly different from those reported for murine topoisomerase II. In fact, in the case of topoisomerase II, the base immediately preceding the site of enzyme attack was either G or C; in addition, the cleavage was irreversible at G sites, but reversible at Cs which comprise one-third of the sites. A mechanism for the biased behaviour toward G and C in the presence of the eukaryotic enzyme has been proposed. According to the model, the N7 of G is exposed to efficient alkylation by the drug, which blocks enzymatic re-ligation and thereby stabilizes DNA damage. In contrast, the NH2 and N3 reactive sites of C, being involved in base pairing, remain effectively protected from CL alkylation. Hence, the C preference is promoted by non-covalent interaction with the drug and, in this model, CL behaves like a classical topoisomerase poison.We note that CL stimulation of topoisomerase IV-mediated cleavage is in general asymmetric. If G is present at the −1 position of both strand-breakage sites, CL induces a double-strand break. If G is present at the −1 position of one of the two strand-breakage sites, CL induces a single-strand break. If G is absent at the −1 position, CL does not affect the strand-breakage and reunion activity of topoisomerase IV. This feature is consistent with our present observation of weak inhibition of topoisomerase IV enzymatic activity in a decatenation assay (Figure 2A). Thus, these results revealed the molecular basis of topoisomerase poisoning by CL and suggested that, as is the case with human topoisomerase II, topoisomerase IV could ligate the two scissile bonds of a cleavage site in a non-concerted manner.The sequence specificity of S.pneumoniae topoisomerase IV-mediated cleavage induced by CL is dramatically different from that of quinolones. In the case of the diterpenoid drug, G is always preferred at the cleavage site (−1 position), while a wider consensus DNA sequence (−2A, +1G, +4C, +6T) is driven by quinolones, with no specific base requirement at position −1. Were CL to force the enzyme to cut the DNA at the G level, then one would expect cleavage at every G in DNA. On the contrary, only a subset of Gs is cleaved. We propose that CL cleaves only those G nucleotides that are first processed by topoisomerase IV.

In S. cerevisiae, the glycolytic flux is directed towards ethanol due to the Crabtree effect during cell growth on glucose. Then, ethanol was converted to acetaldehyde through cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetyl-CoA is further oxidized from acetate, which is derived from acetaldehyde. The PPD synthesis from acetyl-CoA requires 13 enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). PPD biosynthesis-related enzymes were thus divided into two expression cassettes, as shown in Fig. 2a, and delta17 and delta15 were chosen for multi-copy integration. The first cassette includes seven genes, namely, ERG9, ERG20, ERG1, PgDDS, PgPPDS, AtCPR1, and tHMG1, which were integrated into the delta17 multi-copy site of BY4742 to construct the PPD synthetic pathway. Transformants were screened using CM-His medium and further verified through PCR amplification. The heterologous genes PgDDS, PgPPDS and AtCPR1, which encode dammarenediol-II synthase (DDS), protopanaxadiol synthase (PPDS) and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR1), respectively, are essential for PPD synthesize from 2,3-oxidosqualene. Because the multiple integrations occurred randomly with a low probability (about 1–10%), there was a huge range of PPD production among the clones screened. A total of 192 positive colonies were examined via HPLC analysis after shake flask fermentation for 72 h (Additional file 1: Fig. S1a). The PPD-producing strain named B-C9 had a PPD yield of 2.21\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.45 mg/g DCW (10.93\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.89 mg/L), while strain BY-I achieved a PPD yield of 11.32\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.45 mg/g DCW (58.43\\\\u2009±\\\\u20091.76 mg/L). The copy numbers and transcription levels of two heterologous genes (PgPPDS and AtCPR1) and two endogenous genes (tHMG1 and ERG9) of the first cassette were detected using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). In comparison with B-C9, the copy number and RNA transcription levels of ERG9, PgPPDS, AtCPR1, and tHMG1 in BY-I have risen to varying degrees, which makes it an outlier (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Next, the second cassette composed of ERG8, ERG12, ERG13, MVD1, IDI1, ERG10, and tHMG1 was integrated into the delta15 multi-copy site of BY-I to strengthen the transformation of acetyl-CoA into isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which were the isoprenoid building blocks. Considering that HMG1 is the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway (MVA pathway), tHMG1 was integrated again to increase HMG-CoA flux. One hundred and fifty-three positive colonies were verified using HPLC (Additional file 1: Fig. S1b). The PPD yield of strain BY-II exhibited a prominent improvement and achieved 33.23\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.26 mg/g DCW (164.30\\\\u2009±\\\\u20093.48 mg/L), which was 2.94 times higher than that of BY-I (Fig. 2b). The copy numbers and transcription levels of four endogenous genes (tHMG1, ERG8, ERG10 and IDI1) of the second cassette were detected. And the relative transcription levels of tHMG1, ERG8, ERG10 and IDI1 in BY-II were 1.61, 2.07, 2.17, and 2.01 times higher than that of BY-I (P\\\\u2009<\\\\u20090.01) (Additional file 1: Fig. S2), which were consist with PPD production.S. cerevisiae is an ideal platform for heterologous biosynthesis of triterpenoids. However, the low catalytic efficiency of cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s), which require NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases (CPR) to provide electrons, was the primary challenge for terpenoids synthesis. ER proliferation could enhance the insertion and retention of the P450 reductase in the ER membrane to reach a high-level catalytic efficiency of membrane-localized P450s. The key ER regulatory factor INO2, together with INO4 and OPI1, are the primary ER responsive elements of S. cerevisiae, which constitute an auto-regulatory phospholipid biosynthesis system. It has been reported that overexpression of INO2 for ER expansion could drive ER sheets proliferation, alleviate stress and improve the cell viability. In the present study, INO2 was overexpressed through promoter swapping. Four strong promoters, namely, PHXT7, PPGK1, PTDH3, and PTEF1, were selected to replace the INO2 endogenous promoter of BY-II, resulting in BY-III-1, BY-III-2, BY-III-3, and BY-III-4, respectively. As seen in Fig. 3a, the cell growth of BY-III strains far surpassed that of BY-II after 24 h. The PPD production of BY-III-1, BY-III-2, BY-III-3, and BY-III-4 at 48 h reached 156.75\\\\u2009±\\\\u20097.89, 151.55\\\\u2009±\\\\u20091.44, 153.43\\\\u2009±\\\\u20094.77, and 197.26\\\\u2009±\\\\u20091.14 mg/L, respectively, which equaled or even exceeded that of BY-II at 72 h. Notably, strain BY-III-4 exhibited a surprised PPD yield of 40.79\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.30 mg/g DCW (310.35\\\\u2009±\\\\u20098.96 mg/L) at 72 h, which increased 1.89 times than that of BY-II (164.30\\\\u2009±\\\\u20093.48 mg/L) (P\\\\u2009<\\\\u20090.001) (Fig. 3b and Table 1). Kim et al. previously reported that overexpressing INO2 could expand the ER, thus improve the capacity to synthesize ER-associated proteins and cytochrome P450-mediated PPD, and increase available space to accommodate them. In our study, the cell growth and PPD production of BY-III strains are significantly improved by up-regulation INO2 possibly due to efficient localization of cytochrome P450 in an expanded ER as a possible mechanism, which is consistent with Kim’s studies. For PPD biosynthesis, the lanosterol pathway is a competing pathway. It has been reported that down-regulation of lanosterol synthetase (ERG7) expression can increase the metabolic flux of target terpenoid. However, as one of the inherent components of cell membrane, lanosterol is essential for the normal growth of S. cerevisiae, thus cannot be knocked out. In the current work, dynamic control, based on a carbon-source regulated promoter PHXT1, was introduced to relieve the competition between cell-growth and PPD production associated processes. Maury et al. previously characterized the PHXT1 promoter in S. cerevisiae via transcriptional analysis, which was high expressed in glucose-excess and low expressed in glucose-limiting conditions. Owning to the glucose-sensing toggle switch of PHXT1, the cell-growth of BY-III-5 was divided in a glucose growth phase and an ethanol growth phase, and BY-III-5 was conferred a significant increase of PPD production, with a PPD yield of 57.25±0.25 mg/g DCW (412.13\\\\u2009±\\\\u20091.93 mg/L) at 72 h, which is 2.51 times higher than that of BY-II (Fig. 4 and Table 1). To further test the efficiency of PHXT1, the endogenous promoter of ERG7 in BY-III-4 was replaced by PHXT1, resulting in BY-IV. Although a lower growth in logarithmic phase was observed in BY-IV compared to BY-III-4, the metabolic flux of DM-II in BY-IV was promoted conspicuously, showing a DM-II accumulation of 177.64\\\\u2009±\\\\u200913.39 mg/L. It is possible that ERG7 was induced in the presence of glucose at the early stage of cell growth and repressed after the depletion of glucose, which boosted the synthesis of DM-II and impaired the synthesis of lanosterol.Maintaining the sterol homeostasis is of paramount importance for fungi growth and metabolism. The sterol-regulating transcription factor UPC2 plays an essential role in the sterol homeostasis of S. cerevisiae by upregulating MVA pathway, and has been successfully used to enhance terpenoids production. To further improve PPD production, UPC2.1, the G888D mutant of UPC2, was introduced. Meanwhile, the phosphatidate phosphatase (LPP1) was knocked out to diminish the metabolic flux of farnesol. Hence, the PPGK1-UPC2.1-TADH1 expression cassette was knocked into the LPP1 locus of BY-IV by CRISPR/Cas9, resulting in BY-V. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the yield of PPD by strain BY-V was further increased. Moreover, the DM-II of BY-V declined to 66.91\\\\u2009±\\\\u20097.38 mg/L, and the PPD yield went up to 78.13\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.38 mg/g DCW (563.06\\\\u2009±\\\\u20091.65 mg/L) (P\\\\u2009<\\\\u20090.01), which was a new record to the best of our knowledge. As a major by-product of sugar manufacturing process, molasses contains approximately 50% fermentable sugars and a small number of nitrogenous compounds, inorganic salts, and trace elements, which are the essential nutrients for growth and biosynthesis of S. cerevisiae. The shake flask fermentation was conducted with an initial molasses concentration of 40 g/L. As shown in Fig. 5, the cell growth of strain BY-V in molasses was faster at the logarithmic phase, and closed at stationary phase, compared with that of YPD. However, the PPD titer and PPD yield (PPD/sugar) in molasses were 402.22\\\\u2009±\\\\u20097.39 mg/L and 13.11\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.16 mg/g, respectively, at 72 h, which were just 71.37% of those in YPD medium. To further improve PPD titer, fed-batch fermentation was carried out. The potential of BY-V for PPD production was firstly investigated by restricted glucose/molasses feeding strategy (Table 2 and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). The production of PPD with glucose and molasses feeding achieved 841.09\\\\u2009±\\\\u20092.16 mg/L and 556.26\\\\u2009±\\\\u20094.90 mg/L, respectively. The lower PPD titer in molasses might be caused by the large quantities of ash and metal ions in molasses, which inhibit the synthesis of target compounds. Then, two-stage feeding strategy was conducted. The initial concentrations of glucose and molasses in YPD medium were 20 and 40 g/L (containing approximately 20 g/L of fermentable sugars), respectively. In the early stage, glucose and molasses were fed to improve cell growth, respectively. After 48 h, ethanol (99.7%, v/v) was added at intervals to facilitate PPD accumulation. As shown in Fig. 6a, the two-stage feeding strategy resulted in high cell biomass. The OD600 of BY-V achieved 48.62 in molasses-ethanol, which is 2.12 and 1.81 times higher than that of batch and fed-batch in molasses, respectively. Moreover, the PPD titer went up to 1.25\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.01 g/L after 168 h, with a PPD yield [PPD/(sugar\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009ethanol)] of 15.63\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.83 mg/g (Fig. 6b and Table 2). Ethanol was commonly used in yeast fermentation for terpenoids accumulation. Zhang et al. has reported that 138.80 mg/L of β-amyrin production was achieved using pure ethanol feeding. In this study, ethanol was fed as the sole carbon source after glucose/molasses depletion (Fig. 6c). The OD600 of BY-V was 46.94, slightly lower than that in two-stage feeding with molasses-ethanol. Surprisingly, 1.55\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.02 g/L (106.55\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.91 mg/g DCW) of PPD was accumulated at 168 h, which is 2.79 and 1.24 times higher than that of molasses feeding and two-stage feeding with molasses-ethanol. Moreover, the PPD yield of restricted ethanol feeding strategy went up to 19.41\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.75 mg/g and 22.79\\\\u2009±\\\\u20091.06 mg/g, respectively (Fig. 6d and Table 2). These results demonstrated that although ethanol served as a non-fermentable carbon source and might hinder the growth of engineering chassis, it facilitated the synthesis of PPD via acetyl-CoA pathway directly rather than by the complex glycolytic pathway. To evaluate the performance of the PPD production of strain BY-V in high-density culture, a 5-L bioreactor with 1.5 L of synthetic medium was employed. Ethanol was fed at intervals to control the ethanol concentration in the range of 1–5 g/L. The ethanol metabolism results the accumulation of NADH, which is regenerated by oxidative phosphorylation and consequently consumes large amounts of oxygen. Hence, adequate oxygen supplement is needed to promote cell growth and PPD synthesis. To maintain the dissolve oxygen (DO) of fermentation broth at 40%, pure oxygen was supplied when the cell growth of BY-V entered logarithmic phase (about 48 h) (Fig. 7a and b). Then, the strain entered stationary phase at 96 h, and attained a maximum OD600 of 262.14 at 108 h. The PPD of culture broth was continued to accumulate with a PPD titer of 8.63\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.13 g/L (100.82\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.42 mg/g DCW) at 120 h (Fig. 7c and Table 3). Zhao et al. reported that a large amount of PPD was secreted to extracellular space and adhered to the stainless pipe and the inner tank wall. Notably, PPD mainly showed intracellular accumulation (10.18\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.35 g/L) with sugarcane molasses as the initial carbon source in a 5-L bioreactor. As compared with glucose, sugarcane molasses generates less foam and adhered sediment, which increases oxygen transferring and facilitates downstream pretreatment and separation. In our study, the total PPD production, including fermented broth and faint yellow sediment, attained 15.88\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.65 g/L (188.50\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.56 mg/g DCW) at the end of the fermentation (Fig. 7c, Table 3 and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). The PPD titer was a new record and 1.44 times higher than that of ZW04BY-RS, reported by Wang et al.. This result indicates that using molasses as the cheap carbon source with ethanol feeding is an effective strategy for PPD production.\\', \\'ref_149:Striatal B was chosen as coating hapten in ELISA, because it is more polar than striatal A. In order to increase its solubility in aqueous solution, an equal volume of DMSO was added to the buffers. The optimum coating conditions (best signal-to-noise ratio and concentration dependence) were obtained by coating the plate in PBS/DMSO (1/1, v/v) buffer. More intense signals were obtained by coating at 24°C or 37°C, compared to coating at 4°C. Striatal B was adsorbed more efficiently by coating overnight than for 2 h. Based on these results, the optimum coating conditions for striatal B are summarized as follows: PBS/DMSO (1/1, v/v) buffer, and coating overnight at 24°C. The optimum concentration for coating of the hapten and the dilution of polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) were determined by checkerboard titration to be 5 μg mL−1 and 1:200, respectively, which were used in the following indirect competitive ELISA experiments.Due to the poor solubility of cyathane diterpenoids in aqueous solutions, the tolerance against organic solvents used to dissolve these compounds was tested for assay optimization. An addition of 5% DMSO, acetonitrile or methanol, respectively, to the pre-incubation solution was found acceptable. Methanol could be used up to 25% without a notable negative effect. High percentages of DMSO up to 30% and of acetonitrile up to 20% resulted in considerable negative effects on the assay. An addition of DMSO >30% or acetonitrile >20% showed a sudden increase of signals. Since methanol reacts with striatals, an addition of 5% DMSO or acetonitrile was selected for pre-incubation in the following indirect competitive ELISA.Figure 2 illustrates a typical standard calibration curve of striatal B. The specificity of the pAbs against striatal B was evaluated by determination of the cross reactivities of several structurally related compounds, such as striatals A, C, and D, striatins A and B, and erinacines C and P. The IC50 values are given in Table 1. All of the tested cyathane diterpenoids showed cross reactivities against striatal B. No color reaction was detected with non-coated plates as blanks. Intra-assay and inter-assay precisions were determined for several concentrations of striatal B (Table 2). The intra-assay precision was calculated from the extinction difference at 450 nm and 630 nm within one microtiter plate. Less than 10% CV were obtained in every experiment, indicating an acceptable precision. The inter-assay precision was obtained from %B/B0-values of 8 plates on different days. Variations of less than 20% were observed. The average IC50 of striatal B standard was 36.0 ng mL−1 with an inter-assay CV of 13.2% (n = 5). To assess the assay accuracy, striatal B was added to the sample matrix in several concentrations, and the recoveries of the spiked samples were determined. In parallel, HPLC-DAD was used to analyze the spiked samples. The apparent recoveries of striatal B in the sample matrix as determined by indirect competitive ELISA ranged from 97.3% to 125.9%, while those obtained by HPLC-DAD varied from 95.8% - 110.2%. The limit of quantification was 0.02 μg mL−1 for ELISA, and 0.40 μg mL−1 for HPLC-DAD. A good correlation between the striatal B concentrations measured by ELISA and by HPLC-DAD (y = 1.1122× – 0.1585, R2\\\\u2009=\\\\u20090.9942) was observed (Figure 3, Table 3).\\', \\'ref_150:The in vitro release results showed that in both release media, the release of free DHA was relatively slow, and the release rate did not reach 50% even after seven days of release. DHA-NLC, DHA-CCNLC, and DHA-NGR/CCNLC showed the release rates that reached more than 70% within 72\\\\u2009h; thus, the release rates of DHA-NLC, DHA-CCNLC, and DHA-NGR/CCNLC are greatly improved compared with the raw material DHA. On comparison between DHA-CCNLC and DHA-NGR/CCNLC groups, no significant difference in the drug release behavior was observed between the target-modified biomimetic nanocarrier group and the unmodified nanocarrier group, indicating that modification with the NGR peptide had no effect on drug release (Figure S1C and D). As shown in Figure 5(A–D), the uptake of COU6-CCNLC and COU6-NGR/CCNLC by HUVEC cells and bEnd.3 cells was significantly stronger than that of COU6-NLC, and the fluorescence intensity of the NGR peptide target-modified biomimetic nanocarriers was the strongest. The free NGR peptide also significantly inhibited the uptake of COU6-NGR/CCNLC by the cells, indicating that the NGR peptide effectively through BBB and targeted tumor, delivered drugs to the brain tumors. The results of the uptake of the bio-nanocarriers shown in Figure 5(E,F) indicate that compared with the controls, the C6 cells had stronger fluorescence with the uptake of NLC wrapped by CC membranes, showing the homologous targeting ability of tumor cells. The combination of homologous targeting and NGR peptide modification provides active targeting, thus facilitating drug delivery at brain tumor sites. To investigate the effect of the biomimetic nanopreparations on the growth inhibition of C6 CCs, the CCK-8 assay was performed to investigate the cytotoxicity of raw materials and preparations. It can be seen from Figure 5(G) that the raw drug and nano-preparation have significant concentration dependence, and the inhibitory effect on C6 cells increases with an increase in the drug dose. The IC50 values of DHA, DHA-NLC, DHA-CCNLC, and DHA-NGR/CCNLC were 54.57, 46.09, 34.45, and 20.05\\\\u2009μg/mL, respectively. Among them, the biomimetic nanopreparations modified by the NGR peptide had the strongest inhibitory effect. We further verified the homologous targeting effect of nanoparticles by evaluating the endocytosis effect of nanoparticles in different tumor cells. Figure 5(H–J) shows that HepG2 cells and B16 cells showed less ability to endocytose COU6-CCNLC compared with the C6 cells, which further illustrated that CCNLC had a homologous targeting and specific recognition function, indicating that the selective targeting characteristics of CCNLC were not suitable for other atypical CCs.In vitro BBB and BBTB models were constructed using Transwell chambers to evaluate the ability of the biomimetic nanopreparations to cross the BBB and BBTB. The in vitro BBB and BBTB models were determined to have a barrier function with resistance values of 332.7 Ω·cm2 and 332.3 Ω·cm2, respectively (Srinivasan et al.,). As shown in Figure 5(K,L,M,O), the penetration ability of NGR/CCNLC was the strongest and was significantly different compared with that of CCNLC, which proves that the NGR peptide as a targeted ligand is of great significance for penetrating the BBB and BBTB. Further, the CCK-8 method was used to detect the inhibitory effect of nanoparticles on C6 cells after penetrating the BBB. The results showed that the cell survival rates of DHA, DHA-NLC, DHA-CCNL, and DHA-NGR/CCNLC in the BBB were 93.44%, 87.35%, 79.78%, and 54.59% and those in BBTB were 95.85%, 89.38%, 77.47%, and 58.80%, respectively. The inhibition of C6 cells by DHA-NLC, DHA-CCNLC, and DHA-NGR/CCNLC increased in that order, and the inhibitory effect of the NGR peptide as a target ligand-modified biomimetic nanopreparation on C6 cells was the highest after penetrating the BBB and BBTB (Figure 5(N,P)). In this study, the distribution of drugs after administration was monitored in mice in real-time via an in vivo imaging system. As shown in Figure 6(A,B), the fluorescence level in the saline group was weak. It is important to note that neither the fluorescence of the mice nor saline interfered with the determination of the fluorescence signals. It was difficult for the free DiR to penetrate the BBB and reach the brain, and only a small amount of fluorescence was detected in the brain, and it very quickly disappeared. DiR-DHA-CCNLC was injected into the body and circulated in vivo, and the fluorescence at the tumor site reached a maximum at 8\\\\u2009h, which was because DHA-CCNLC could be accumulated at the tumor site by homologous targeting. After 8\\\\u2009h, the fluorescence at the tumor site decreased gradually, but a certain fluorescence intensity was still maintained at 36\\\\u2009h. The DHA-NGR/CCNLC group showed obvious fluorescence at the tumor site at 2\\\\u2009h. The fluorescence intensity reached the highest level at 12\\\\u2009h and remained at high even after 36\\\\u2009h, which was associated with an extension of the in vivo circulation time by the combination of CC membrane and NGR peptide to increase the drug-brain accumulation, thus increasing the efficacy. After blocking the tumor vascular receptor with free NGR peptide, the transport of DHA-NGR/CCNLC was blocked, but it still accumulated in the tumor, proving the homologous targeting effect of CC membranes. The in vitro images of various organs showed (Figure 6(C,D)) that because of the excellent BBB permeability and tumor-targeting ability of DHA-NGR/CCNLC, the fluorescence intensity at the tumor site in this group was significantly stronger than that in DHA-CCNLC group without target modification and the control group with free DiR. This proved that the biomimetic nano-preparation modified by NGR had excellent BBB-crossing and tumor-targeting abilities. Analysis of other organs found that the liver and spleen, as the largest elimination and immune organs, accumulated a large concentration of the biomimetic nanopreparations. The accumulation of drugs at the tumor site was observed by 3D CT scanning, which verified the tumor targeting ability of drugs (Figure 6(E)). The brain targeting and tumor targeting of NGR to occupy the related receptors in the BBB in mice were verified using free NGR peptide (Vainshtein et al.,). As shown in Figure 6(F–H), DHA-NGR/CCNLC transport was blocked after the NGR peptide blocked the receptor, but some drugs were still transported to the brain tumor tissues via the homologous targeting mechanism. To further study BBB penetration and tumor infiltration of the biomimetic nano-preparations, the brain tissues of the mice injected with DiI-labeled biomimetic nanopreparations were sectioned. The results showed that free DiI could not penetrate the BBB, whereas DiI-DHA-CCNLC and DiI-DHA-NGR/CCNLC were distributed in tumor tissues (Figure S2A), further confirming their homologous targeting effects, with DiI-DHA-NGR/CCNLC being the most distributed at tumor sites (Figure S2B). This indicated that NGR peptide modification enhanced the tumor targeting ability of drugs. The in vivo targeting experiment showed that the CC membranes could prolong the in vivo circulation time to a certain extent. Therefore, we measured the in vivo circulation time. Figure S2C shows that DiD-DHA-CCNLC and DiD-DHA-NGR/CCNLC were rapidly removed in the first 8\\\\u2009h, and gradually decreased after 8\\\\u2009h. Approximately, 20% of DiD-DHA-CCNLC and DiD-DHA-NGR/CCNLC still existed in the circulatory system at about 36\\\\u2009h, whereas free DiD was rapidly cleared out of the body within 4\\\\u2009h. The results showed that the CC membranes improved the circulation time of NLCs in vivo, which is beneficial in improving the bioavailability of NLCs and lays a foundation for the accumulation of NLC in the brain. The in vivo therapeutic performance of the biomimetic nanopreparations was studied in glioma-bearing mice. DHA-NGR/CCNLC group showed the best anti-tumor ability of all groups and significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with the saline, free DHA, DHA-NLC, and DHA-CCNLC groups. The TUNEL results showed that (Figure 7(A)) compared with the saline and other administration groups, the DHA-NGR/CCNLC group showed significant apoptosis of the tumor cells (green), indicating that the biomimetic nanomedicine inhibited tumor growth by inducing apoptosis. ImageJ statistical quantitative results further confirmed this result (Figure 7(B)). The Kaplan–Meier survival curve also showed that DHA-NGR/CCNLC could significantly prolong the lifespan of the mice (Figure 7(C)). Whole-brain H&E staining histological analysis showed that (Figure 7(D)) the saline group tumor cells were arranged closely, the nuclei were complete, and there was almost no damage. Further, the number of tumor cells in the free DHA and DHA-NLC groups showed some decrease, but there was no obvious damage. However, the number of tumor cells in DHA-CCNLC and DHA-NGR/CCNLC groups was significantly reduced, and significant cell shrinkage, necrosis, and tissue damage were observed. The DHA-NGR/CCNLC group had the best inhibitory effect on tumors. To investigate the proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells, immunohistochemical staining was performed on the brain tissue sections, and the CD31 (Figure 7(E)) expression levels and analysis of apoptosis (caspase 3, CC3) (Figure 7(F)) receptor related to cell proliferation showed that the DHA-NGR/CCNLC group had the highest apoptosis and the lowest proliferation of tumor cells. On observing the development of brain tumors by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 7(G)), DHA-CCNLC and DHA-NGR/CCNLC were found to have good anti-tumor effects. The tumor volume of mice administered with DHA-NGR/CCNLC was the smallest, and the results confirmed that the target-modified biomimetic nanomedicine had a good therapeutic effect.Histopathological analysis (Figure 8(A)) showed that there was no significant pathological damage to any organ tissues in mice injected with free DHA, DHA-NLC, DHA-CCNLC, and DHA-NGR/CCNLC compared with those injected with saline. The levels of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (Neu), lymphocytes (Lym), monocytes (Mon), platelets (PLT), and red blood cells (RBC) in the blood are shown in Figure 8(B,C). The changes in the indices in mice treated with each preparation were within the normal range and remained relatively stable. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), uric acid (UA), and creatinine (Cr) (Figure 8(D–F)) showed no significant difference between each preparation, indicating that the nano-preparations coated with CC membranes had good biocompatibility. This laid the foundation for targeted delivery to brain tumors and effective anti-tumor efficacy.\\', \"ref_151:Terpenoids, including monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20) and triterpenoids (C30), are synthesized by terpene synthases with IPP and DMAPP as substrates (Yang et al.; Zhang et al.; Zong et al.). Traditionally, terpenoids are synthesized by plants in low amounts. The production of terpenoids by physical extraction is a time-consuming and laborious process. In addition, the long growing seasons of such plants is subject to high levels of variation due to differences in soil, climate and geography, which creates difficulties for the company\\'s supply chain. Synthetic biology applies genetic engineering tools to build synthetic pathways in microbial cell factories to overproduce chemicals with high titers and yields. Thus, it is of great significance to develop microbial cell factories for achieving terpenoids biosynthesis.Sesquiterpene synthases catalyze the conversion from farnesyl diphosphate to a large variety of sesquiterpenes. To date, various sesquiterpenes were successfully produced by recombinant microorganism, such as β-copaene (Mischko et al.), nerolidol (Qu et al.), farnesol (Chonglong et al.), patchoulol (Liu et al.), humulene (Harada et al.) and other important sesquiterpenes. Yang et al. reported that the engineered E. coli synthesized 220\\\\u2009±\\\\u20096 mg/L of β-caryophyllene from glucose by co-expression of geranyl diphosphate synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-caryophyllene synthase genes (Du et al.). Liu et al. reported that patchoulol titer in the recombinant S. cerevisiae reached 141.5 mg/L in a shake flask (Liu et al.). Han et al. reported that engineered E. coli synthesized 80 mg/L of (−)-α-bisabolol in the shake-flask culture by combinatorial expression of the exogenous MVA pathway, farnesyl diphosphate synthase and (−)-α-bisabolol synthase (Han et al.). τ-Cadinol is a sesquiterpene that is widely used in perfume, fine chemicals and medicines industry. In this study, we constructed a biosynthetic pathway from glucose to τ-cadinol in E. coli by combinatorial expression of the exogenous MVA pathway, farnesyl diphosphate synthase IspA and τ-cadinol synthase CS.The biosynthesis of τ-cadinol was further improved by optimizing biosynthetic pathway and overexpression of rate-limiting enzyme IdI. Finally, we increased the production of τ-cadinol to 133.5\\\\u2009±\\\\u200911.2 mg/L by relieving end product feedback repression with a two-phase organic overlay-culture system. Zhu et al. established an in vitro reconstituted terpenoid pathway system that allows monitoring of the steady-state kinetic and biochemical parameters and the accumulation of intermediates (Zhu et al.). The information thus gained could be used to guide the optimization of each biosynthetic component in E. coli for improvement of the production of terpenoid-derived compounds in vivo. Based on this information, we placed AtoB, ERG13 and tHMG1 genes on low-copy plasmids, IdI, ERG8, MVD1 and ERG12 genes on medium-copy plasmids, and IspA and CS genes on high-copy plasmids. Recruiting better performing enzymes is often a good strategy to break bottlenecks in engineered MVA pathways. S. cerevisiae ERG12 is inhibited by substrate MVA. Therefore, the use of feedback-resistant ERG12 can reduce MVA accumulation and promote the biosynthesis of terpenoids. Chen et al. reported that lycopene titer was increased 2.4 folds by replacing the wild-type ERG12 from S. cerevisiae with the feedback-resistant ERG12 (Chen et al.). Rad et al. reported that use of B. licheniformis IdI in place of E. coli IdI increased lycopene production 1.4 folds in engineered E. coli (Rad et al.). HMGR consumes 2 molecules of NADPH to reduce HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Therefore, increasing the supply of NADPH will be a potentially important strategy to improve the yield of terpenoids. Recently, assembling multienzyme complexes to prevent intermediate diffusion through RIAD–RIDD interaction so as to link the upstream MVA pathway with the downstream carotenogenic pathway increased carotenoid production by 5.7-fold (Kang et al.). Therefore, future efforts (for example, reduce the accumulation of intermediates by the optimization of each biosynthetic component and identification of feedback-resistant enzyme, increasing the supply of redox cofactors, discovery of novel τ-cadinol synthase, and prevent the diffusion of intermediate by assembling multienzyme complexes) will be needed to improve the production of τ-cadinol.\", \\'ref_152:This study was designed to evaluate the antinociceptive, antiedematogenic, and acute toxic effects of EOPPgfl in experimental models of pain and inflammation. The results demonstrated that EOPPgfl, with the chemical composition here described, presented very low acute toxicity and antinociceptive effects, probably due to anti-inflammatory activities. The sample of P. polygalaefllorus seeds of the present investigation produced the same yield (2.4% of EO) found by Evangelista et al. and Leonhardt et al, thus confirming the great EO yield of the seeds. It is also worth mentioning that this yield was obtained using a cheap and easy method of EO extraction: steam distillation. The chromatographic analysis identified 100% of the compounds, predominantly sesquiterpenes, which largely differed from that of the previous investigation. In the present case, there was a major constituent (beta-elemene, 48.2%, followed by trans-caryophyllene, 19.5%), whilst in the previous study a major constituent was not identified (β-cariophyllene, 20.6%, followed by spatulenol, 16.6%). This is not surprising, since it is known that EO compositions differ with the place and season of collection; the time of collection of the present and previous samples differed (February vs October, respectively). Since there is a large difference in chemical composition and it may affect the pharmacological results, care should be taken to obtain the appropriate EOPPgfl sample.The results demonstrated that the calculated LD50 for EOPPgfl, given orally, was 3.4 g/kg allowing the oil to be classified within the category of low-toxicity essential oils and to be considered a safe oil regarding acute toxic aspects. It is important to note that the doses that inhibit nociception and edema formation in the various models tested are in the range of 10–100 mg/kg, which represent doses below 3% of LD50. Thus, EOPPgfl can be considered to have high therapeutic potentiality. Moreover, this study also showed that EOPPgfl possesses antinociceptive activity on chemical and thermal nociception models. In the hot plate test, 30 mg/kg EOPPgfl increased the latency time to the thermal stimulus. This test of thermal nociception is a good method for measuring the effects of opioid analgesics but it is not sensitive to the analgesic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. EOPPgfl increased the response time to the thermal stimulus in the hot plate test, suggesting that EOPPgfl acted primarily at the spinal medulla and/or higher central nervous system levels, but not excluding an indirect mechanism. In order to investigate the participation of an indirect mechanism of the effect of EOPPgfl, its action in acetic acid-induced writhing and in the formalin tests was investigated and the oil showed antinociceptive effects in both tests.The investigation of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of EOPPgfl action was not the objective of this study. However, it is known that in the second phase of the formalin test, the release of inflammatory mediators occurs, and that there are differences in the edema induced by carrageenan and dextran. Dextran, within 30 min after its injection, leads to edema mediated by histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), which contribute with the increase of vascular permeability and fluid extravasation due to degranulation of mast cells. Carrageenan induces an acute vascular response with protein-rich exudate and containing large numbers of neutrophils. The inflammatory response has three distinct phases. The first relates to the release of histamine and serotonin, the second (90–150 min) is mediated by the release of bradykinin, and finally in the third phase, the mediator is suspected to be prostaglandin. In the late phase of the formalin test, the release of inflammatory mediators occurs such as histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandin, thus the edema must be due to such mediators. EOPPgfl inhibited formalin-induced paw edema, and with a similar potency, inhibited the dextran-induced edema (77.5%), and the first phase of carrageenan-induced edema (76.98%). This suggests that EOPPgfl may be inhibiting the synthesis, release, and/or effects of histamine and serotonin. In conclusion, EOPPgfl was active in nociception and acute inflammation in rodents at very low doses in relation to its LD50, which is compatible with its use in folk medicine. Given the large yield of the seeds, it can be hypothesized that EOPPgfl is at least part of the active principle of the effects of the seeds preconized in folk medicine. Therefore, the current investigation provides information for the search of a novel candidate for the prevention and treatment of inflammation, either EOPPgfl (with a chemical composition here described) or a combination of its major constituents.\\', \\'ref_153:Triptolide (TP) demonstrates a variety of biological activities and pharmaceutical effects. However, the toxicity of TP to the alimentary system, as well as its poor solubility and low bioavailability, limits its wide clinical application. Numerous studies have reported different delivery systems for the targeted administration of TP to tumors or inflamed tissue. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of solid tumors and inflammatory tissue has been extensively utilized in the field of nanomedicine. However, achieving full drug enrichment in tumors or other targeted locations is a challenging task. Furthermore, TP aims to produce systemic effects in order to achieve therapeutic outcomes. Reducing cytotoxicity to normal tissues is an important strategy for minimizing the side effects of drugs. C60(OH)n has been reported to possess antioxidant properties, offering protection against cytotoxicity induced by DOX. A derivative of C60(OH)n (DSPE-PEG-C60) developed by our team was found to exhibit cytoprotective effects against DOX-induced damage in normal cells in vitro, as demonstrated in our previous study. DSPE-PEG-C60 was also found to be compatible with the oil phase in this study. Then, the amphiphilic DSPE-PEG-C60 was used as one of the components in formulating drug carriers for the development of the C60-SMEDDS/TP.The inclusion of DSPE-PEG-C60 in the SMEDDS led to the production of nanoparticles measuring 50 nm in size with a near-neutral zeta potential of −1.60 mV (Table 2). Oral absorption of microemulsions is important for the in vivo function of C60-modified microemulsions. Researchers investigated the in vivo absorption of microemulsions following oral administration through a visual study. According to their imaging data, smaller particles (50–100 nm) were taken up by enteric epithelial cells more readily than larger particles (500–1000 nm), which were rapidly digested and formatted into mixed micelles. Some microemulsions are carried by the lymphatics after being absorbed by the epithelium, which greatly enhances their bioavailability and overall absorption. This transport mechanism helps avoid first-pass hepatic metabolism. According to the above results, our specially designed C60-SMEDDS/TP with their appropriate particle sizes would be expected to enhance intestinal absorption in vivo.Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause DNA breakage and lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane, are believed to be involved in the mechanism of TP-induced cell damage. Considering the critical role that ROS-mediated inflammation plays in the pathogenesis of TP, we investigated the potential protective effects of the C60-modified SMEDDS against TP-induced cellular ROS. Compared to free TP and the SMEDDS/TP, the C60-SMEDDS/TP can more effectively scavenge free radicals, reduce intracellular ROS, and decrease the apoptosis of L02 and GES-1 cells. This study also investigated the protective effects of the C60-SMEDDS/TP on mitochondrial membrane potential during TP-induced injury. The results showed that the DSPE-PEG-C60/TP group had a greater mitochondrial membrane potential than the free TP group and the SMEDDS/TP group on L02 and GES-1 cells. The cytoprotective effects of the C60-SMEDDS/TP on normal cell lines are consistent with our earlier findings. Would the therapeutic efficacy of TP in combating cancer be compromised when the C60-SMEDDS/TP is protecting the viability of healthy cells? Our study found that, unlike previous studies, DSPE-PEG-C60 showed a slight compromise in antitumor ability compared to the TP group on BEL-7402 and HepG2 cells, as demonstrated in the apoptosis tests. However, this compromise would be weakened when drug exposure time was prolonged, as demonstrated in the CCK-8 tests. Given that liver damage is the primary adverse reaction of TP, the use of the C60-SMEDDS/TP could potentially offer a more favorable safety profile.\\', \\'ref_154:In order to testify our hypothesis, we chose the OGD and reperfusion model in primary cultured neurons to simulate artery recanalization-induced cerebral I/R injury in vitro. As our results showed, aescin treatment obviously decreased the LDH-releasing ratio after 2 hours of OGD followed by 24 hours of reperfusion, which indicated that aescin was capable to protect neurons against OGD and reperfusion-induced injury. Meanwhile, our findings demonstrated that aescin worked in a dose-dependent way. At a dose of 50 μg/ml in vitro, aescin could provide neuroprotective effects with less side effects. Beyond this concentration, the more aescin was administrated, the more cytotoxicity was presented.PRAS40, a proline-rich Akt substrate, was identified as a regulator of the mTOR signaling pathway. PRAS40 in conjunction with mTOR is closely associated with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases, such as improving insulin sensitivity, decreasing cardiomyocyte apoptosis after myocardial infarction and neuroprotectivity after transient focal cerebral ischemia. Our study suggested that aescin could significantly upregulated the phosphorylation level of PRAS40 and mTOR in primary cultured neurons after OGD and reperfusion, while the phosphorylated PRAS40 and mTOR was decreased without aescin treatment. S6K and 4E-BP1 are considered as the best-characterized downstream effectors of the mTOR signaling pathway, after OGD and reperfusion; the phosphorylated S6K and 4E-BP1 had the same trend with phosphorylated PRAS40 and mTOR; both of them were upregulated after aescin treatment compared with the OGD and reperfusion group. However, the role of PRAS40 in the mTOR signaling pathway is still controversial. Some of the studies stated that mTOR activity in some cell lines was inhibited by PRAS40 overexpression; silencing PRAS40 would increase the phosphorylation level of the mTOR signaling pathway. In contrast, other studies have determined that PRAS40 is essential to activate the mTOR signaling pathway and is an important bridge linking Akt and mTOR signaling pathways. In order to confirm the interaction between PRAS40 and mTOR signaling pathways in neuronal I/R injury, we used lentivirus-expressing PRAS40 to testify the role of PRAS40. It revealed that PRAS40 gene transfer promoted the phosphorylation of proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway, including mTOR, S6K, and 4E-BP1. In addition, PRAS40 overexpression reduced the release of LDH, which referred to ameliorating the I/R injury of primary cultured neurons. But the loss of PRAS40, knockdown by PRAS40 shRNA, showed an exact opposite trend. It inhibited the phosphorylation of proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway and aggravated the neuronal injury induced by OGD and reperfusion. Thus, our data support that PRAS40 is essential for mTOR activation and its downstream effectors in neuronal I/R injury.For years, aescin has been used in the clinical therapy of brain trauma or intracranial hemorrhage. But the clinical application in subsequent cerebral I/R injury is rarely reported. This study demonstrates the protective effects of aescin treatment against the neuronal I/R injury and reveals that the PRAS40/mTOR signaling pathway may be the underlying mechanism of aescin protection. However, this study has potential limitations. All of these results only provide in vitro evidences for the protective effects of aescin. It is still unclear whether or not aescin protects I/R injury in vivo and warrants investigation in the future study by using PRAS40 overexpression/knockout mice.\\', \\'ref_155:In this work, we investigate how the position of cobalt in the Keggin anion impacts its catalytic activity in the oxidation of terpenic alcohols with hydrogen peroxide. Potassium tungstate salts containing Co(II) or Co(III) as heteroatom (i.e., K6CoIIW12O40 or K5CoIIIW12O40), silicotungstic acid (i.e., H4SiW12O40), and its salts of Co or K (K4SiW12O40 and Co2SiW12O40) were synthesized and evaluated as catalysts. They were characterized by FT-IR, UV–Vis, EDS/SEM, Raman, TG/DSC, XRD, cyclic voltammetry, and potentiometric titration. While the XRD patterns of potassium tungstocobaltate(II) and (III) were quite similar to potassium silicotungstate or heteropolyacid. Infrared and UV–Vis spectra showed bands that confirmed the inclusion of Co as the countercation or as a heteroatom.Potentiometric titration showed that, depending on the oxidation state of cobalt, and its position in Keggin heteropoly salt, one or two plateaus can be observed in the curves. Raman spectroscopy spectra show that cobalt has distorted tetrahedral coordination, mainly the K5CoIIIW12O40 salt, making it an unstable salt, which collapses when titrated as *n*-butylamine, justifying the consumption of a larger volume of the base, even in the absence of the proton. Among the salts tested in oxidation reactions of borneol, the K5CoIIIW12O40 salt was the most active and selective catalyst. The higher activity of the K5CoIIIW12O40 catalyst was assigned to its higher acidity strength. Based on experimental data, a reaction pathway was proposed, involving a Co-W peroxide intermediate. The K5CoIIIW12O40 salt was also effective in the oxidation of secondary alcohols, appearing as an option to be used in the oxidation of other alcohols. As far as we know, this is the first time that heteropolyacid salt catalysts containing Co(II) or Co(III) as heteroatoms are used in oxidation reactions. The use of the K5CoIIIW12O40 catalyst in a nonelectrochemical oxidation process, without an external potential source, opens up a new perspective for its use.**Supplementary Information** The online version contains supplementary material available at<https://doi.org/10.1007/s10562-023-04441-9>. **Acknowledgements** The authors are grateful for the financial support from CNPq and FAPEMIG (Brazil).

The reason why Rb1 is easier to generate Rg5 than Rg3 is that the free energy of Rb1 to generate carbocation is far lower than that of Rg3.The main reason why S-Rg3 is easier to generate Rg5 than R-Rg3 is that S-Rg3 does not form intramolecular hydrogen bonds between 20C–OH and 12C–OH, so it does not need to provide additional energy, like R-Rg3, to destroy intramolecular hydrogen bonds, so the energy required to generate carbocation is lower than R-Rg3. Another reason is that S-Rg3 has a higher solubility than R-Rg3 in the reaction solvent.Clarifying the pathway and theoretical research of ginsenoside conversion to Rg5 are of great significance for the efficient and low-cost preparation of the bioactive substance ginsenoside Rg5, which will undoubtedly promote extensive research on the pharmacological activity of ginsenoside Rg5 and the development of related drugs.\\', \\'ref_157:The TPL/Ce6 NPs, with an average particle size of 168.0±2.70 nm and a homogeneous spherical morphology, demonstrated precise and rapid drug release and 1O2 production under light irradiation in acidic pH and ROS environments. In vitro, these NPs were efficiently internalized by HepG2 cells, showing a significantly enhanced therapeutic effect against cell proliferation, ROS generation, and apoptosis induction.More importantly, the advantages of tumor tissue accumulation, even 24 h post-administration, along with pH/ROS dual-responsive drug release, chemotherapy, and PDT, allowed the intravenous administration of TPL/Ce6 NPs to effectively suppress tumor growth in H22 tumor-bearing mice with high biosafety.Collectively, the designed TPL/Ce6 NPs hold promise as a co-delivery carrier for combined chemo-photodynamic therapy, offering a novel strategy to achieve amplified synergistic effects in cancer treatment.\\', \\'ref_158:Isoprenoids comprise a large class of chemicals of significant interest due to their diverse properties. Biological production of isoprenoids is considered to be the most efficient way for their large-scale production. Isoprenoid biosynthesis has thus far been dependent on pathways inextricably linked to glucose metabolism. These pathways suffer from inherent limitations due to their length, complex regulation, and extensive cofactor requirements. Here, we present a synthetic isoprenoid pathway that aims to overcome these limitations. This isopentenol utilization pathway (IUP) can produce isopentenyl diphosphate or dimethylallyl diphosphate, the main precursors to isoprenoid synthesis, through sequential phosphorylation of isopentenol isomers isoprenol or prenol. After identifying suitable enzymes and constructing the pathway, we attempted to probe the limits of the IUP for producing various isoprenoid downstream products. The IUP flux exceeded the capacity of almost all downstream pathways tested and was competitive with the highest isoprenoid fluxes reported.First, summarize the theme of the article in one sentence.

Evolutionary pathways in nature have created dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases (DMATSs) and aromatic indole prenyltransferases (PTs) that catalyze regio- and stereoselective prenylation of tryptophan (l-Trp) core leading to the biosynthesis of an array of complex alkaloids (Figure 1A). Regioselective methods that isoprenylate the tryptophan core leading to complex bioactive molecules are highly desirable. While prenylation is a process concerning incorporation of a C5-isoprene substrate (as in dimethylallyldiphosphate in biogenesis), isoprenylations generally refer to expanded multimers of the isoprene unit including geranyl, farnesyl, and related substrates. Either l-Trp or its corresponding DKP (l-Trp-AA) are typical substrates for these biochemical isoprenylation reactions. Beyond this early biosynthetic step, tailoring enzymes such as halogenases, methyltransferases, oxidases, cyclases, and others catalyze reactions that result in enormous structural diversity of the ultimate products (Figure 1B). DKP natural products consist of a vast array of biomedically significant compounds serving as leads for numerous therapeutics as well. These natural products continue to serve as a test bed for discovering new transition metal-catalyzed processes for achieving high regio- and stereoselectivities of products. Numerous studies have targeted indole C3-activation executing C–C bond formation resulting in allylation, isoprenylation, benzylation, crotylation, and various related alkylation products. Organocatalytic methods have also addressed the challenge of indole-C3-allylations in elegant ways. Total synthesis strategies and related biosynthetic investigations that target prenylated tryptophan scaffolds have enabled development of new chemistry and biochemistry.Among bioactive members of these natural products, nocardioazine A displays noncytotoxic inhibition of mammalian P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated drug efflux and thereby is an important lead toward developing therapeutics with reduced toxicity of anticancer drugs. Considering that efflux pumps are one among the major contributors for emergence of resistance, natural compounds that inhibit mammalian ABCB1, ABCG2, and MDR1 types of ATP-dependent efflux pumps are urgently needed. Access to isoprenylated indole alkaloids, possessing P-gp inhibitory activities, via regioselective syntheses are therefore desirable. The indole side chain of tryptophan presents a complex array of nucleophilic sites, presenting several competing modes of reactivity. Biosynthetic steps engineer selectivity based on the tertiary fold and active site of each enzyme to enforce catalysis through tightly controlled transition-state geometries yielding regioselective products that exclude other possibilities. However, native enzymes have highly specific substrates, and thereby, their synthetic scope is limited. Nonenzymatic methods to directly affect isoprenylation of indoles under aqueous conditions are challenging. We previously reported a solvent-dependent, biomimetic Cope rearrangement leading to C4-n-prenylation (n = normal) to access ergotamine scaffold regioselectively. Subsequently, in the context of studying nocardioazine biogenesis (a C3-n-prenylated marine alkaloid), we had reported an indole C3-n-prenylation methodology operating, under mild conditions, to access relevant nocardioazine biosynthetic intermediates.\\', \\'ref_161:Natural products are widely used as pharmaceuticals, flavors, fragrances, and cosmetic ingredients. Synthesizing and evaluating analogs of natural products can considerably expand their applications. However, the chemical synthesis of analogs of natural products is severely hampered by their highly complex structures. This is particularly evident in isoprenoids, the largest class of natural products. Here, we develop a yeast cell-based biocatalytic method that enables the systematic biotechnological production of analogs of different classes of isoprenoids (including monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, and cannabinoids) with additional carbons in their skeletons. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach through two proof-of-concept studies: the biosynthesis of the highly valued aroma ingredient ethyllinalool, and the production of cannabinoid analogs with improved cannabinoid receptor agonism. This method is simple, readily adaptable to any cell factory, and enables the tailored expansion of the isoprenoid chemical space to identify molecules with improved properties and the biotechnological production of valuable compounds.First, summarize the theme of the article in one sentence.

It has been shown that ISCOMs display high adjuvant activity against a broad range of bacterial and viral antigens. However, the side effects of ISCOMs are their toxicity, caused by the presence of the hemolytic saponins of Q. saponaria, a consistently insufficient adjuvant activity, and the absence of a satisfactory method of preparing them for industrial applications. The development of the ISCOMATRIX™ adjuvant, based on purified saponin fractions from Quil A substantially overcomes these shortcomings. However, we proposed principally new biologically active components, glycoglycerolipids and triterpene glycosides isolated from marine macrophytes and invertebrates, respectively, to modify and optimize ISCOM vehicles for microbial antigens. The immunologically inert phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) of ISCOMs was replaced by glycolipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGalDG) from marine macrophytes (algae and seagrasses). Subsequent substitution of the sum of saponins from Q. saponaria by triterpene glycosides from sea cucumbers, possessing immunostimulating activity, resulted in a tubular superstructure of the complexes (TI-complexes) instead of the vesicular one of classical ISCOMs.Based on these results, we developed a prototype of TI-complex consisting of the sum of monosulfated triterpene glycosides from Cucumaria japonica, cholesterol, and MGalDG from marine macrophytes with a component weight ratio of 3:2:6, respectively. To obtain an antigen carrier, we further developed a method based on that proposed earlier by Copland et al. Biological tests of the TI-complex prototype revealed that it had adjuvant activity. However, these pilot preparations of TI-complexes appeared to be heterogeneous with a large amount of source material (amorphous phase of MGalDG + cholesterol), and intermediate structures apart from the complex particles. Perhaps this was a cause of non-reproducible and often contradictory immunization results. The presence of intermediate structures was also characteristic of classical ISCOM preparations obtained by methods of dialysis, the hydration of lipid films, and the injection of diethyl ether. The aim of the present work was to obtain an antigen carrier based on triterpene glycosides from C. japonica, cholesterol, and MGalDG from marine macrophytes with reproducible properties and high adjuvant activity. The practical part of the work is protected by Application № 2010122159/10(031466) for Patents of the Russian Federation.\\', \\'ref_163:Endoperoxides (EPOs), or cyclic dialkylperoxides, are a unique class of compounds whose properties are largely determined by a remarkable structural feature – the -O-O- bridge. Aromatic EPOs have attracted much attention, mainly as a convenient source of 1O2 for a variety of applications, ranging from chemical synthesis to photomedicine. This interest has been sparked both by the recognition of 1O2 as a selective oxygenation agent and due to its strong cytotoxicity, making it one of the most dangerous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in biological systems. The reactivity of 1O2, as compared to the ground state molecular oxygen, 3O2, is greatly enhanced due to the excess energy and the spin-allowed character of the reactions with other molecules that display singlet multiplicity, thus making 1O2 one of the strongest known oxidizing species. Fortunately, 3O2 remains inert towards organic compounds in their singlet states, owing to the resonance stabilization of its π-electron system and Wigner’s spin conservation rule. This permits life on our planet to exist under aerobic conditions at ambient temperatures.Thermal, photochemical, or chemical activation of aromatic EPOs often leads to the quantitative release of 1O2, and the mechanisms of attachment and release of O2 have been thoroughly investigated, both experimentally and theoretically. In most cases, the -O-O- bridge is formed in a concerted [2\\\\u2009+\\\\u20094] cycloaddition of a 1O2 dienophile to a flat aromatic substrate. Inversely, cycloreversion leads to the release of 1O2 and the regeneration of hydrocarbon. Another way the -O-O- bridge can be formed is the trapping of 3O2, which is applied, e.g., in the synthesis of cyclic peroxides. It is also an established experimental approach in the studies of biradicals.So far, non-aromatic EPOs remain somewhat less elaborated, and their chemistry is not understood that well, perhaps with the exception of some naturally occurring ones, such as prostaglandin G2, artemisinin, and the endoperoxides of β-carotene (βCar-EPOs, Fig. 1a). Our previous studies revealed that in a sensitized process all-trans-β,β-carotene (βCar) sequentially accumulates up to eight oxygen atoms, while its C40-skeleton remains intact, yielding a series of βCar-EPOs, whose major products are β-carotene-5,8,-endoperoxide (βCar-5,8-EPO) and β-carotene-7,10-endoperoxide (βCar-7,10-EPO). To account for the pigment oxygenation mechanism, we proposed a concerted [2\\\\u2009+\\\\u20094] cycloaddition of 1O2 to βCar in an s-cis-diene conformation, according to generally accepted mechanism of attachment of 1O2 to dienes. The products of this chemical quenching appear to be responsible for the controversial pro-oxidant features of carotenoids (Crts), in particular βCar. βCar-EPOs, found to rapidly accumulate in plants under high-light stress, were assumed to be the products of the in situ chemical quenching of 1O2 by βCar. Their accumulation, in particular of βCar-5,8-EPO, is correlated with chronic Crts oxygenation, the extent of photosystem II photoinhibition, and the expression of various 1O2 marker genes. The lower mass and volatile degradation products of βCar-EPOs, such as β-cyclocitral, play a crucial role in the chemical signaling of oxidative stress in oxygenic photosynthesis.The chemical reactivity of Crts has to be viewed as one of the broad range of crucial roles that these simple isoprenoid pigments play in living organisms, including humans but, in particular, in photosynthetic organisms. Crts are considered to be the first line of defense against ROS, owing to their anti-oxidant features, and their capacity to nearly “catalytically” scavenge 1O2 and chlorophyll (Chl) triplets through physical quenching. The versatile (photo)protective functioning of Crts relies on their low-energy T1 state, matching that of the 1Δg state. Crt T1 is able to intercept the excitation energy from Chl triplets and 1O2, and then to dissipate it harmlessly into the environment. Practically each collision of Crt molecules with these excited species leads to spin-allowed intramolecular excitation energy transfer (EET), and they are quenched almost within the diffusion limits. The quenching of Chl triplets by Crts is especially important in photosynthetic pigment-proteins, in which Crts also play accessory antenna functions. Recently, it has been found that Crt triplets can be efficiently generated via singlet fission in Crt aggregates or in photosynthetic antenna complexes, which is relevant to the quest to elevate the quantum performance of organic solar devices. The efficiency of photosynthesis organisms and of such devices critically depends on (photo)protection, which ensures their durability under dense photon fluxes. In the photosynthetic apparatus, a major risk is associated with the excellent 1O2 sensitizing properties of Chls, since their excited state relaxation is dominated by the S1-T1 intersystem crossing (ISC), despite the absence of heavy atoms in these molecules. Paradoxically, photosynthetic solar energy conversion, the major source of bioenergy on the planet, relies entirely on singlet-singlet energy transfer, and useful photosynthetic reactions must necessarily compete with ISC in Chls. This latter process is wasteful in terms of energy and creates a severe risk of 1O2 sensitization and oxidative damage to the photosynthetic machinery, the very origin of molecular oxygen.Considering the mechanism of βCar-EPOs formation, the cycloaddition of 1O2 to a 1,3-diene system with 6-s-cis conformation, present near the ionone rings in the βCar molecule, apparently may result in βCar-5,8-EPO. However, oxygenation to βCar-7,10-EPO requires an s-trans to s-cis conversion at the single C8–C9 bond, implying a different mechanism for the addition of O2. Furthermore, chemically generated 1O2 does not cause oxygenation, but only isomerization of βCar, whereas the lifetime and concentration of 1O2 in our preparative system are expected to be strongly suppressed by both βCar and βCar-EPOs. Such pilling-up inconsistencies motivated us in this study to investigate in detail the mechanisms of the formation and breakdown of βCar-EPOs, and the involvement of 1O2 and other ROS in these processes. We synthesized and characterized a series of βCar-EPOs, and their breakdown was monitored using HPLC and LC-MS/MS techniques and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electronic absorption and time-resolved emission spectroscopies. In particular, our principal approach was to tune, in our preparative system, the level of O2 and the lifetime of 1O2 from the nanosecond to the millisecond range. In parallel, ab initio computations were performed to gain structural and thermodynamic insights. Here, we demonstrate that 1O2 does not participate in oxygenation of βCar and the formation and breakdown of βCar-EPOs are not concerted reactions. Our study reveals a strong biradical character of the T1 state as well as its key role in the photophysics and (photo)chemistry of Crts. βCar-EPOs are an uncommon example of non-aromatic EPOs that release 1O2. We also show, for the first time, that Crts in solution weakly sensitize 1O2.\\', \\'ref_164:The prenyltransferase (NphB) is the first step in combining geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and olivetolic acid (OA) to produce cannabigerolic acid (CBGA). NphB is capable of catalyzing the C- and O-geranylation of a variety of aromatic compounds. It can catalyze the geranylation of OA at the C3 position to form CBGA (minor) and at the O2 position to form 2-O-geranylolivetolic acid (2OG, major). Numerous studies have reported that enhancing its product specificity and kinetic performance enables the efficient synthesis of CBGA. This is the common precursor of cannabinoid compounds in the cannabis biosynthetic pathway. CBGA could be further converted into CBDA, THCA, CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids. Although CBGA biosynthesis and some non-natural analogs have been achieved in yeast- and cell-free catalysis, the low catalytic activity for NphB still is a critical rate-limiting factor in the synthesis process. There is a strong need for further research into its catalytic mechanisms to improve yields.In this study, we employed the rational design and modification of NphB to enhance the biosynthesis of various cannabinoid scaffolds. Additionally, we revealed its catalytic mechanism that results in the synthesis of different cannabinoids by NphB mutants. These results lay the foundation for synthesizing rare cannabinoid compounds.\\', \\'ref_165:To develop such “universal” reference, avoiding overlapping with extract and product signals was essential. The analysis of the natural product database NP-MRD (https://np-mrd.org/) suggests which NMR regions are the less signal-populated. A library of compounds whose 1H (1H-1H) NMR spectra were run in CDCl3 and referenced to the deuterated solvent or TMS was analysed (for other d-solvents, please see the Supporting Information). The non-experimental (simulated/predicted) spectra, and those of “not usable” quality were discarded. In the frequency histogram represented in Figure 1A, the number of molecules having signals in each NMR region (separated by 0.5 ppm) is represented. In the histogram shown in Figure 1B, the number of recorded signals for each NMR region is depicted. As can be seen in Figure 1A, no natural product molecules present signals in the δH 0-0.5 range. Between δH 5.0-7.00, a relatively low number of molecules display signal peaks. On the other hand, Figure 1B shows that the δH 0-0.5 range presents no signals, while the interval 0.5-3.0 is quite populated, and then the relative number of signals is reduced, particularly in the δH 5.0-7.00 range. Comparing with the data recorded for other solvents, the δH 0.0-0.5, 6.0-7.00 and δH > 8.5 ranges seem to be the less populated ones. Therefore, standards whose signals appear in those regions would be desirable, particularly if they present signals in more than one interval. Otherwise, they cannot be considered “universal” references, since in practice different standards may be required for different samples. As commented, different commercial references have been developed, and for instance the TraceCERT® standards have intense, and often sharp signals, at different shifts, and have been used to quantify pure substances and mixtures. However, to find an “universal” NMR reference for the quantification of structurally-diverse natural products in extracts is not trivial (see Table S1 in Supporting Information). In effect, some references such as ethylene carbonate, duroquinone, dimethylsulfone, dimethylmalonic acid, malic acid and alcohols have signals in the same range as most plant extracts (δH 0.5–5). The signals of other standards (such as benzoic acid and its esters, phthalates, 1,2,4,5-tetrachloro-3-nitro-benzene, etc) overlap with those of natural products containing aromatic rings or double bonds. Some NMR references display signals in two different ranges, such as thymol or 1,3,5-trimethoxy-benzene, and are more versatile NMR standards, but still their signals corresponding to aliphatic H-C overlap with those of plant extracts, and the signals in the aromatic/olefinic area can interfere with the few differentiated signals of bioactive natural products. Therefore, they are not suitable as “universal” references. In this communication we report the design and synthesis of a versatile, low-cost NMR reference, suitable to efficiently quantify artemisinin and a variety of natural products in extracts. It would present signals in two “little crowded” regions, δH 5-7 and δH<0.5, and at least one of them would not overlap with those of the sample. Bioactive terpenes, steroids, alkaloids, aromatic compounds, and quinones, among others, were quantified with this “universal” reference to show the feasibility of this approach.As commented in the Introduction, a limitation of this technology is that the target compounds should have signals that separate from the bulk, and whose area can be measured accurately. If the separation is not good, then the standard HPLC techniques or NMR/HPLC combinations should be used. However, as demonstrated with artemisinin, sitosterol, and the other library compounds, most bioactive natural products possess some aromatic, olefinic, or heteroaromatic functions, or have differentiated methyl group signals. The signal separation can also be improved in some cases by varying the deuterated solvent. Therefore, this NMR reference and the reported protocol can be applied in most cases. This low-cost method only needs a small amount of the extract, is accurate and operationally simple, and a large volume of samples can be processed in little time. Indeed, data acquisition is fast (less than 3 min and no calibration curves are needed), particularly with automatic switching of samples placed on NMR carousels. Therefore, the novel NMR reference and the optimized protocols will be quite useful for natural product chemists and industrial quality controls.\\', \"ref_166:Data analysis were carried out using GraphPad Prism 7, and Student\\'s t-test were employed for statistical analyses with a level of significance of p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.Colorless solid; αD 25 -33.0 (c 0.09, MeOH); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε): 213 (3.44), 229 (3.59) nm; ECD (0.0007 M, MeOH) λmax (Δε) 236 (+0.37), 211 (−1.74), 197 (−0.82) nm; IR (KBr) vmax: 3443, 2927, 1715, 1637, 1607, 1451, 1279, 1228, 1113, 1097, 715 cm−1; 1H NMR data, see Table 1; 13C NMR data, see Table 2; HRESIMS: m/z [M + H]+, calcd for: 566.3112, found: 566.3128.\", \\'ref_167:1H NMR (600 MHz, Chloroform-d) δ 6.25 (s, 1H, H-15), 4.78 (s, 1H, H-7), 4.72 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H, H-20 ax), 4.26 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 1H, H-11), 4.19 (s, 1H, H-12), 3.79 (dd, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H, H-20 eq), 3.78 (s, 3H, 21-OCH3), 3.13 (s, 1H, H-14), 2.93 (d, J = 12.9 Hz, 1H, H-5), 2.89 (d, J = 15.8 Hz, 1H, H-1ax), 2.38 (dt, J = 14.7, 2.9 Hz, 1H, H-6 ax), 2.33 (d, J = 15.8 Hz, 1H, H-1eq), 2.18 (d, J = 1.3 Hz, 3H, 5′-CH3), 2.07 (br s, 1H, H-9), 1.92 (d, J = 1.4 Hz, 3H, 4′-CH3), 1.85 (d, J = 1.7 Hz, 3H, 18-CH3), 1.75 (ddd, J = 14.6, 13.0, 2.7 Hz, 1H, H-6 eq), 1.38 (d, J = 1.1 Hz, 3H, 19-CH3), 0.94 (s, 9H, H-Me3CSi), 0.17 (s, 3H, H-Me2Si), 0.13 (s, 3H, H-Me2Si). 13C NMR (150.9 MHz, Chloroform-d) δ 192.4 (C-2), 172.3 (C-21), 167.5 (C-16), 164.8 (C-1′), 161.3 (C-3′), 145.4 (C-3), 136.2 (C-4), 114.4 (C-2′), 82.9 (C-7), 81.7 (C-13), 76.1 (C-12), 74.4 (C-20), 71.3 (C-11), 66.1 (C-15), 53.4 (21-OCH3), 51.9 (C-14), 50.9 (C-1), 45.7 (C-8), 43.0 (C-5), 42.3 (C-9), 40.8 (C-10), 29.7 (C-6), 28.0 (C-4′), 26.4 (Me3CSi, 3C), 21.0 (C-5′), 19.2 (Me3CSi, C), 15.8 (C-19), 14.7 (C-18), −3.4 (Me2Si), −3.6 (Me2Si).

Following screening of various conditions, we obtained compound 3 as a minor product with a yield of 30% under NaH and MeOH, and compound 5’s O-1,4-addition byproduct as the major product. Subsequent screening of several Lewis acids, such as BF3·OEt and TiCl4, yielded substrate 5’s O-DA reaction byproduct as the major product. To our delight, conducting the reaction in acetone at 55°C in the presence of K2CO3(2 eq) afforded the desired 1,4-addition product 3 with 60%–68% yield (Figure 5).With precursor 3a in hand, we intended to construct the desired C-C bond by single-electron oxidation under conditions including a metal base (Table 1). In the presence of LHMDS and cupric chloride (CuCl2) or ferric chloride (FeCl3), we obtained a very small amount of the EOC product 2a and 2a′, although the recovery yield was 60% (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). We assumed that LHMDS conditions were not conducive to the formation of stable enolates, thus, screened various metal bases. When using LDA as the base, the reaction only provided a complex mixture and trace amount of product with the oxidant CuCl2 (Table 1, entry 3). The substrate was completely consumed under conditions including KHMDS or NaHMDS (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). Although we tried numerous oxidative conditions, the yield of oxidative coupling products was not significantly improved (Table 1, entries 6 to 11).\\', \\'ref_171:Compound 2 (1α,8α-diacetoxy-6β,9β-dibenzyloxy-2-oxodihydro-β-agarofuran): To a stirred solution of compound 1 (22 mg, 0.04 mmol) in dichloromethane (DCM, 10 mL; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,Ltd, Shanghai, China) was added acetyl chloride (0.05 mL) and a catalytic amount of 4-(N,N′-dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.

In the next step, hybrids 8, 9, 11 and 12 were synthesized via an amide coupling reaction between cyclic peroxide containing acid and an aminoquinoline under action of EDCI\\\\u2009⋅\\\\u2009HCl/DMAP system in DCM (Scheme\\\\u20051). Hybrids 8, 9, 11 and 12 were obtained in moderate to good yields (47–77\\\\u2009%). For an acid, which contains a tricyclic monoperoxide moiety, yields of target hybrids (11–13) were 17–30\\\\u2009% higher, compared to an acid containing a bridged 1,2,4,5‐tetraoxane moiety, and which resulted in target hybrids 8–10 (see Scheme\\\\u20051). Hybrids 10 and 13 were synthesized via an esterification reaction between corresponding acids and an alcohol containing quinoline moiety under the action of a DCC/DMAP system in DCM, which gave yields for 10 and 13 of 47\\\\u2009% and 67\\\\u2009%, respectively.The in\\\\u2005vitro anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 potency of novel hybrid drugs was confirmed using Vero E6 cells. In addition, the cytotoxicity of all hybrid compounds towards Vero E6 cells was determined. All new artesunic acid‐quinoline hybrid compounds 2–7 show in\\\\u2005vitro activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 (EC50 values 7.8–46\\\\u2005μM) and moderate or no cytotoxicity at the effective concentrations (CC50 values 25–110\\\\u2005μM). The morpholine‐containing derivative 7 showed the highest activity (EC50=7.8±3.0\\\\u2005μM), which might be due to the morpholine moiety that may enhance the activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 because of its basic nature. While compound 7 is the most active, it shows moderate toxicity to the Vero E6 cells (CC50=25±2.9\\\\u2005μM). In case of synthetic peroxide‐containing hybrids 8–13, compounds 8–10 with a 1,2,4,5‐tetraoxane moiety were several times more active than compounds 11–13, containing a tricyclic monoperoxide fragment. Whereas most active synthetic peroxide‐quinoline hybrids are 9 and 10 (EC50 values 13±0.3 and 11±0.3\\\\u2005μM, respectively, Table\\\\u20051), they show also moderate cytotoxicity to the Vero E6 cells (CC50 28–37\\\\u2005μM). While hybrids 3–5 show no higher anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 activity (EC50 down to 13±1.1\\\\u2005μM) than parent compound 14 (EC50 6.4±0.2\\\\u2005μM), they are significantly more active in\\\\u2005vitro than their parent compound artesunic acid (EC50>50\\\\u2005μM). Furthermore, the parent compounds 14, artesunic acid and a reference drug chloroquine are comparably more cytotoxic (CC50 values down to ∼27, Table\\\\u20051).

The results indicated that P. aeruginosa 8485 and P. fluorescens 2421 showed resistance to all concentrations 25–100 µl of 1 mg/ml VBL (Fig. 3). The growth profile analysis indicated that both strains grew slowly on nutrient agar media with P. aeruginosa 8485 forming translucent shiny white small colonies and P. fluorescens 2421 appeared as white colonies with smooth edges.The growth profiles of these bacteria were further investigated after immobilizing them with 4% sodium alginate. Immobilized cells of P. aeruginosa 8485 demonstrated a lower multiplication rate and did not achieve full growth within 24 h as compared to the free cells. Their optical density (0.464) was lower than that of free cells (1.525) while the pH (7.1) was similar to free cells (7.6). In case of P. fluorescens 2421, both immobilized and free cells exhibited similar multiplication rates and achieved full growth within 24 h. The optical density and pH level of immobilized cells (1.393 and 8.4, respectively) closely matched those of free cells (1.489 and 8.7).The progress of VBL biotransformation was assessed by sampling the reaction mixture on days 1, 5, and 8, followed by analysis using TLC and LC–MS/MS (Figs. 4, 5, 6). The thin layer chromatogram from the 1st day displayed two distinct spots with the Rf values 0.77 and 0.74, resembling standard VBL and VCR, respectively indicating the initiation of VBL transformation to VCR from day 1 (Fig. 4). The chromatogram from the 8th day exhibited a yellowish-brown spot with the Rf value of 0.74 consistent with VCR standard suggesting the conversion of VBL to VCR by Pseudomonas species (Fig. 4). In contrast, the control flask without VBL showed no presence of either VBL or VCR.Analysis of LC–MS/MS data of the reaction fraction of the 1st and 8th day revealed the presence of VBL and VCR as well as several other unknown compounds. Concurrently, standard VBL and VCR were also analysed for the identification of anticipated metabolites in bacterial reaction fractions (Fig. 5). LC–MS/MS spectra and fragments ions of mass spectroscopy of bacterial metabolite sample of P. aeruginosa 8485 revealed that 79% of VBL was converted to VCR within 24 h, which further increased to 92% by the 8th day (Fig. 6A,B). On the other hand, biotransformation using P. fluorescens 2421 resulted in a significantly higher conversion of 95% of VBL to VCR compared to 79% of P. aeruginosa 8485 within 24 h. However, it decreased to 88% by the 8th day and any VBL remained thereafter was completely degraded (Fig. 6C,D). Simultaneously, analysis of a bacterial control lacking VBL was performed, which showed absence of both VBL and VCR in the bacterial metabolites and only VBL was detected in the substrate control.LC–MS/MS analysis of the biotransformation using immobilized bacterial cells showed significantly lower VCR yield in comparison to free cells on day 1 (Fig. 7). Additionally, it was observed that VBL was completely degraded in the reaction with immbolized cells as compared to free cells. These findings suggested that free cells demonstrated a higher efficiency in transforming VBL into VCR. Comparatively, P. fluorescens 2421 more profoundly converted VBL into VCR than P. aeruginosa 8485 (Table 1).\\', \\'ref_177:Characterization of the prepared CT-NLC and T-NLC had been determined in a previous study, prior to the present investigation of the antitumor activity of CT-NLC and T-NLC. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the nanoparticles were spherical. The particle size of the CT-NLC and T-NLC was 126.7±9.2 nm and 102.4±12.8 nm, respectively. The zeta potential of the CT-NLC and T-NLC was 28.7±3.4 mV and -26.2±2.7 mV, respectively, and the entrapment efficiency was 72.64%±1.37% and 74.64%±0.87%. The cytotoxicity of CT-NLC, T-NLC, and free tripterine was subsequently monitored in PC-3 and RM-1 cells using the MTT assay. Both formulations and free tripterine significantly inhibited the growth of PC-3 and RM-1 cells. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, both formulations and free tripterine showed concentration-dependent cytotoxicity, and the cytotoxicity of the formulations was significantly higher than that of tripterine suspension at all concentrations used. Moreover, CT-NLC had the greatest cytotoxic effect compared with tripterine and T-NLC. As can be seen in Table 1, the IC50 values of the tripterine suspension, T-NLC, and CT-NLC after 48 hours of incubation were 0.88±0.08, 0.64±0.05, and 0.55±0.07 μg/mL for PC-3 cells and 0.79±0.04, 0.49±0.03, and 0.39±0.02 μg/mL for RM-1 cells, respectively. The IC50 values for CT-NLC and T-NLC were lower than that of the tripterine suspension; the IC50 value of CT-NLC was the lowest, accounting for the higher antitumor activity of CT-NLC.No visible symptoms of toxicity, such as weight loss, vomiting, or diarrhea, were observed in mice treated with the tripterine suspension, T-NLC, or CT-NLC at an oral dose of 24 mg/kg. The estimated LD50 values for the tripterine suspension, T-NLC, and CT-NLC were higher than 24 mg/kg. Therefore, we concluded that there were no acute toxic effects at an oral dose of 24 mg/kg, and selected 4 mg/kg (high dose) and 2 mg/kg (low dose) as the oral dose to be used in the subsequent in vivo experiment. As shown in Figure 3A, tumor volumes in the saline control group were excessively enlarged (approximately 1,500 mm3) on day 14, while tumor growth was significantly inhibited by the free tripterine and formulations of tripterine. At the end of the experiment, tumor volumes in mice treated with CT-NLC (4 mg/kg) and T-NLC (4 mg/kg) were 375.6±130.8 mm3 and 497.9±239.6 mm3, respectively, decreased the growth of tumors significantly (P<0.01) by 57.2% and 43.7% compared with that of the free tripterine suspension group (884.3 ±197.2 cm3). CT-NLC had a favorable antitumor effect, and there was no statistically significant difference between the CT-NLC group (4 mg/kg) and the cyclophosphamide group. Compared with the saline control group, the CT-NLC group started to show marked inhibition of tumor growth by day 8 (P<0.01), with no significant adverse effects, such as a decrease in body weight (Figure 4). Comparison of tumor inhibition rates in the treatment groups yielded the following results: cyclophosphamide > CT-NLC 4 mg/kg > T-NLC 4 mg/kg > CT-NLC 2 mg/kg > T-NLC 2 mg/kg > free tripterine 4 mg/kg > free tripterine 2 mg/kg (Figure 3B). Further, the tumor inhibition rate in the CT-NLC group (4 mg/kg) versus the blank control group was 72.68%±6.7%, which was 1.14-fold and 1.96-fold higher than that of the T-NLC and free tripterine groups, respectively. These results indicate that CT-NLC and T-NLC had a greater antitumor effect than free tripterine, in particular CT-NLC. As shown in Figure 4, after 14 days of treatment, a progressive and irregular decrease in mean body weight was noted in all groups, but less so in the CT-NLC and T-NLC groups. Significant weight loss was found in animals treated with cyclophosphamide and in those treated with the free tripterine suspension, and was much greater than that induced by CT-NLC or T-NLC (4 mg/kg, P<0.05) and CT-NLC (2 mg/kg, P<0.05). In contrast, mice treated with the tripterine formulations gained weight during the course of treatment.\\', \"ref_178:C. glutamicum was metabolically engineered for plasmid-independent lycopene overproduction (Table 1). Chromosomal integration of the synthetic operon crtEBI under the control of the endogenous promoter of the gene coding for the translational elongation factor (Ptuf) in the crtYeYfEb deletion mutant of C. glutamicum MB001 (LYC3) was performed in order to improve the expression of prenyltransferase CrtE, phytoene synthase CrtB and phytoene desaturase CrtI encoding genes. Thereby, the flux from the precursor molecules IPP and DMAPP to lycopene was enhanced and an 8-fold higher lycopene titer resulted for strain LYC4. When dxs, encoding the first enzyme of the MEP-pathway, was additionally overexpressed by chromosomal exchange of its natural promoter by the strong promoter Ptuf, the lycopene titer was further improved by 34% and the respective strain LYC5 produced 0.43 ± 0.02 mg·(g·CDW)−1 (Table 1). Strain LYC5 was converted to a β-carotene producing strain (Table 2) by heterologous expression of the lycopene β-cyclase gene crtY from P. ananatis. Plasmid-borne expression of crtY under the control of the isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible tac promoter (pEKEx3_crtYPa) allowed for β-carotene production. Constitutive expression of crtY under control of the Ptuf promoter from the newly constructed expression and shuttle vector pSH1 resulted in a comparable production titer. Similarly, a β-carotene titer of 6.5 mg·g−1 was achieved by BETA3, a strain having crtYPa under the control of Ptuf integrated into the genome of C. glutamicum strain LYC5 (Table 2).In the above described experiments the bacteria B. aurantiaca and P. ananatis were chosen as sources for crtW and crtZ, respectively, although not producing astaxanthin themselves. B. aurantiaca lacks crtZ, but possesses the crtG gene coding for a 2,2\\'-beta-ionone ring hydroxylase and produces canthaxanthin and 2-hydroxycanthaxanthin as main carotenoids. P. ananatis lacks crtW and produces glycosylated zeaxanthin involving CrtZ. Thus, on the basis of available genome sequences, reported carotenoid production and biological diversity, four alternative prokaryotic natural carotenoid producers were selected as donors for crtW and crtZ. Since crt genes of Brevundimonas species were reported to show a high potential for heterologous carotenoid productions two different Brevundimonas strains were selected: Brevundimonas vesicularis, a non-marine bacterium suggested to be a suitable gene donor for astaxanthin production, and as alternative Brevundimonas bacteroides. The marine bacterium Fulvimarina pelagi was chosen due to its promising brownish-yellow color as a consequence of carotenoid accumulation and the evolutionary distance to Brevundimonas. In addition, the red-pigmented marine bacterium Sphingomonas astaxanthinifaciens was selected since experimental evidence that astaxanthin is the major carotenoid produced by this bacterium has been reported. The organization of carotenogenic gene clusters of the considered donors B. aurantiaca, B. bacteroides, B. vesicularis, F. pelagi, P. ananatis, and S. astaxanthinifaciens was analyzed on the basis of the partly available genome sequences/contigs or scaffolds in GenBank: the carotenoid gene cluster of B. bacteroides, an orange-red pigmented bacterium, comprises crtW and crtZ as well as the gene idi encoding the IPP isomerase of the MEP-pathway and several other genes encoding for enzymes of the astaxanthin biosynthesis pathway, however, a crtE gene is not present in its genome. The genome of B. vesicularis DC263, a red-pigmented soil bacterium, possesses a large carotenoid gene cluster with 10 coding sequences, eight of which encode enzymes for the biosynthesis pathway of astaxanthin or the terpenoid precursors IPP and DMAPP. In addition, a second hydroxylase CrtG is encoded, which is responsible for further hydroxylation of astaxanthin leading to 2-hydroxyastaxanthin. Carotenogenic genes of F. pelagi, a Mn(II)-oxidizing bacterium, are found in at least four different loci of the genome. Genes encoding for enzymes of the astaxanthin biosynthesis and glycosylation as well as enzymes for the spirilloxanthin biosynthesis (CrtC, CrtD, CrtF) are present. Furthermore, two genes coding for an ABC-transporter and a MFS-transporter are located next to the carotenogenic genes crtZ and crtY. S. astaxanthinifaciens, producing astaxanthin and its glycosides, has at least two carotenoid gene clusters in its genome also including farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. Moreover, a gene encoding a putative carotenoid transporter is located in this cluster. β-Carotene ketolase and hydroxylase genes (crtW and crtZ, respectively) from B. aurantiaca, B. bacteroides, B. vesicularis, F. pelagi, P. ananatis, and S. astaxanthinifaciens were expressed in the plasmid-free β-carotene overproducing C. glutamicum strain BETA4. The affinities of the β-carotene ketolases and hydroxylases for the various substrates and intermediates of the branched astaxanthin biosynthesis pathway may vary and it is conceivable that astaxanthin production proceeds e.g., only via canthaxanthin or only via zeaxanthin. However, also various other routes via hydroxyechinenone are possible (Figure 1). Thus, in a first step only either crtW or crtZ was expressed in the parental strain BETA4 that produced ~12 mg·(g·CDW)−1 β-carotene with a productivity of ~3.4 mg·L−1·h−1 in 24 h of cultivation and a growth rate of 0.32 ± 0.01 h−1. Zeaxanthin accumulated (0.52 and 1.1 mg·(g·CDW)−1, respectively) when crtZ from P. ananatis or F. pelagi were expressed (data not shown). Canthaxanthin accumulated (0.34 to 1.0 mg·(g·CDW)−1) when crtW from S. astaxanthinifaciens, F. pelagi or B. aurantiaca were expressed, while only traces were observed as consequence of expression of crtW from B. bacteroides or B. vesicularis (data not shown). Thus, crtW from S. astaxanthinifaciens, F. pelagi or B. aurantiaca and crtZ from P. ananatis or F. pelagi appeared suitable for further analysis. Subsequently, combinations of crtW from S. astaxanthinifaciens and B. aurantiaca with crtZ from F. pelagi were co-expressed in strain BETA4 using the two expression vectors pSH1 and pEC-XT99A. In addition, the crtW and crtZ genes from species known to synthesize astaxanthin (B. bacteroides, B. vesicularis, F. pelagi, and S. astaxanthinifaciens) were co-expressed in BETA4. Carotenoids of these strains were extracted and analyzed in the stationary growth phase 24 h after inoculation. Transformants harboring the genes from B. vesicularis grew poorly and were not analyzed further. Co-expression of crtW and crtZ from B. bacteroides and crtW and crtZ from S. astaxanthinifaciens genes led to less than 0.1 mg·(g·CDW)−1 of astaxanthin (Table 3). Strains expressing crtZ from F. pelagi in combination with crtW from S. astaxanthinifaciens, B. aurantiaca, and F. pelagi produced about 0.7, 1.7 and 1.6 mg·(g·CDW)−1 of astaxanthin, respectively (Table 3). In all strains except for BETA4(pSH1_crtWFp)(pEC-XT_crtZFp), β-carotene was the major carotenoid (~2 mg·(g·CDW)−1). C. glutamicum BETA4 co-expressing crtW and crtZ from F. pelagi (subsequently named ASTA1) produced astaxanthin as main carotenoid (1.6 ± 0.3 mg·(g·CDW)−1) and accumulated little canthaxanthin and β-carotene (0.1 ± 0.1 and 0.3 ± 0.1 mg·(g·CDW)−1, respectively) as side products (Table 3). This strain produced astaxanthin with a volumetric productivity of 0.4 ± 0.1 mg·L−1·h−1 in shaking flasks with a growth rate of 0.29 ± 0.05 h−1.\", \\'ref_179:Herein, we prepared TP@HSA NPs following a developed method and then dispersed them in the hydrogel scaffold. TEM (Fig. 2c) and SEM (Additional file 1: Fig. S2) images showed that the TP@HSA NPs were spheroidal in shape and had a uniform size. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis showed that the TP@HSA NPs were well dispersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (0.01 M, pH 7.4) with a hydrodynamic diameter (HD) of 91.2\\\\u2009±\\\\u20096.9 nm, which is in consistent with TEM and SEM. PDI is 0.245\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.009 and average zeta potential was − 22.3\\\\u2009±\\\\u20090.6 mV. The presence of TP in the TP@HSA NPs was validated by the characteristic absorption peak of TP at 1768 cm−1 in the infrared (IR) spectrometer of the nanoparticles. The absorbance in 1020 cm−1 is enhanced without the appearance of new peak, which indicates that there is no covalent connection between TP and HSA (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). Drug loading (DL) and Encapsulation efficiency (EE) of TP in TP@HSA NPs was determined as 6.19% and 68.21%, respectively. Stability study shows that the size of particles changes slightly over 7 days, which means that nanoparticles have good stability (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). Then, we chose an amphipathic self-assembling peptide FEFQFK to form hydrogel for its favorable biocompatibility and biodegradation which is confirmed to be a potent depot to control the release of different therapeutic agents. The mass of peptide is 844.5 Da and the purity is 94.85% (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). TEM images showed that there occurred some twisted ribbon morphologies in a low concentration (1%, w/v), while there came to be network when the concentration increased to 2%(w/v) (Fig. 2b).The combination of nanocomposite hydrogel and acupoint injection is a pioneering attempt in this study. We are interested in that whether acupoint injection can influence the transport behavior of TP@HSA NPs. Therefore, we determined the distribution of TP@HSA NPs at different time by in vivo imaging system in order to explore the difference between acupoint injection and non-acupoint injection and further to illustrate the advantages of our designed acupoint delivery system. Besides, the targeting ability of TP@HSA NPs to inflammatory joints and the property of residence and degradation of nanocomposite hydrogel at acupoints can also be monitored. The result showed that TP@HSA NPs had the ability to target the inflamed joints, which shows that the presence of fluorescence in the joints after administration gradually increased and the injection site decreased (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, we found that when TP@HSA NPs was administrated in ST36 at the other hind paw of mice, it will primely reach to the same site of joints (Additional file 1: Fig. S7), which means that ST36 administration at both hind paws can preferentially target the same site of joints. As was shown in Fig. 3b, comparing acupoint injection with non-acupoint injection, acupoint injection can better reach arthritis joints and the fluorescence intensity in liver is much less. At the first 8 h, TP@HSA NPs group could better target arthritis joints, but TP@HSA NPs-Gel group showed advantage at 24 h and 48 h, which means that gel can control the release of TP@HSA NPs and help them to slowly target arthritis joints. The fluorescence intensity in the paws of AIA rats increased over time, its maximum level occurred at 12 h in TP NPs group and 24 h in TP NPs-Gel group which means that gel can extend the release time (Fig. 3c). The effective arthritis joints targeting ability may benefit better therapeutic effect and the low toxicity of TP in the treatment for RA. Pharmacokinetic test was carried out to further validate the effect of acupoint injection on TP. The concentration of TP in circulation changed overtime in different groups was shown in Fig. 3d. Little TP was detected in the plasma of animals treated with free TP at 12 h after injection, whereas appreciable TP remained in the plasma of animals treated with ST36 TP@HSA NPs-Gel group, even at 36 h after injection. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that AUC0→t for nanocomposite hydrogel was 20.2-fold higher and 3.6-fold higher than that for free TP and TP@HSA NPs, while T1/2 was 4.4-fold higher and 1.5-fold higher (Fig. 3e, Additional file 1: Table S1). These results further indicate the relatively long persistence of TP in plasma in TP@HSA NPs-Gel group. However, the difference between acupoint and non-acupoint is slight (p\\\\u2009>\\\\u20090.05), maybe TP@HSA NPs all enter into blood and lymph circulation in both acupoint and non-acupoint group, so there is only a slight effect on the concentration of TP in plasma. 14 days after modeling, we start the treatment every 3 days according to the schedule (Fig. 4a). It’s reported that CCPA could simulate acupuncture in relieving pain and we here loaded it in hydrogel in order to further extend the action time. So, next we checked whether CCPA-loaded hydrogel can stimulate acupuncture point to relieve pain and extend the time by both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia experiments. As for mechanical allodynia, the paw withdrawal threshold was almost the same for all groups at day 0. After 14 days immunization of CFA, paw withdrawal latency of all groups was reduced significantly and then different treatment started (Fig. 4b). Throughout the experiment, the normal group didn’t cause any significant change in paw withdrawal latency. However, the paw withdrawal latency of negative control group was gradually reduced from 23.11 to 2.65 g. Conversely, after treatment, compared with the negative control group, ST36 CCPA-gel group exhibited little reduction in paw withdrawal from 23.43 to 13.70 g and significant improvement in the pain sensation toward touch stimuli. But the ST36 free CCPA and blank gel treated groups exhibited almost the same as the negative control group, which may ascribe to the transient effect of CCPA or hydrogel alone won’t have analgesic action. Interestingly, non-acupoint CCPA-gel didn’t show such effect, which indicated that CCPA can specially act at the acupoint. After the combination of TP@HSA NPs, nanocomposite hydrogel shows better effect than CCPA-gel group, but there is no significant difference. In thermal hyperalgesia, the normal group showed an average value of 21.77 s throughout the study. However, on the 14th day, the threshold of all other groups exhibited a significant reduction due to the development of RA. After the treatment, an increment in this threshold was observed among the different groups. The highest increment was observed for the CCPA-gel treated group (from 11.53 to 18.03 s) (Fig. 4c). These results were in accordance with the findings of mechanical allodynia, which together confirmed the specific analgesic effect of CCPA-gel in acupoint. Previously studies have shown the therapeutic potential of TP in animal models of RA. After 14 days modeling, thirty mice were randomly divided into five groups (n\\\\u2009=\\\\u20096 in each group) and the administered dose of TP was 1 mg/kg. As expected, the AIA mice treated with saline developed serious inflammation in the joints (Fig. 4d). In contrast, the mice treated with TP showed markedly lower clinical scores, group G3 was the most potent in the inhibition of joint inflammation (Fig. 4g, p\\\\u2009<\\\\u20090.001). Consistent with clinical scores, the paw thickness and volume were highest in mice treated with saline, and group G3 was the lowest. The result indicates that nanocomposite hydrogel has excellent ability in inhibiting the development of arthritis (Fig. 4e and f).\\', \\'ref_180:Esa is a marine natural product (Figure 1A). The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MS data of Esa can be found at Supplementary Materials. The potential cytotoxicity of Esa to murine RAW264.7 macrophages, human hepatocyte LX-2, and human renal cell HK-2 was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)assay. The results showed that Esa had no obvious inhibitory effect on these cell viability at the concentrations from 0.5 μM to 32 μM after a 24 h drug treatment (Figure 1B,D,E). To evaluate the cell viability of RAW264.7 cells, after Esa and LPS co-treatment for 24 h, the cells were pre-treated with various concentrations of Esa or dexamethasone (DEX) for 1 h and then were added to LPS solution to make a final concentration of 50 ng/mL. The results revealed that LPS treatment could slightly promote the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells. The cell viability had no significant changes during the Esa and LPS co-treatment for 24 h. These results were compared with that of DEX at a concentration of 10 μM that served as a positive control in the anti-inflammatory activity assay (Figure 1C). No significant change in cell viability was induced by Esa up to 32 μM, which excluded the possibility that reduced cell viability was responsible for the observed decrease in pro-inflammatory proteins. Furthermore, the low cytotoxicity of Esa toward hepatocyte LX-2 and renal HK-2 cells demonstrated its potential safety, an important factor for a lead development compound.Generally, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is recognized as a primary marker of osteoclastogenesis as it is highly expressed in differentiated osteoclasts. On the one hand, the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of RAW264.7 macrophages model was used to assess the effect of Esa on TARP activity. As shown in Figure 6A–C, the treatment with RANKL 50 ng/mL on RAW264.7 cells increased the number of TRAP-positive and multi-nucleated cells, compared with that of untreated control cells. Esa treatment decreased the number of TRAP-positive multi-nucleated cells in a dose-dependent manner under these conditions. On the other hand, the effect of Esa and RANKL on the expression levels of the proteins that participated in osteoclast differentiation in RAW264.7 cells was also evaluated. The treatment with RANKL 50 ng/mL induced the expression of NFATc1, CTSK, and MMP9 in RAW264.7 cells. However, Esa significantly down-regulated the expression levels in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6D–G). In addition, Esa could inverse the effect on mRNA levels of MMP-9 treated with RANKL in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells (Figure 6H).To better understand the mechanisms by which Esa inhibits osteoclast differentiation, Western blot analysis was performed to measure the expression of key factors involved in the osteoclast differentiation process in RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 7A,D, the treatment of Esa significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK, which are the representative molecules involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. As expected, the treatment with Esa significantly inhibited the activation of NF-κB pathway by suppressing the RANKL-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 in RAW264.7 cells (Figure 7B,E).Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) is a pivotal contributor to immunoregulation. Previous evidence suggests that the NF-κB dependent pathway is related to PPAR-γ activation. In this study, we determined the influence of Esa on PPAR-γ expression in RAW264.7 cells. As expected, this small molecule up-regulated the PPAR-γ expression in the cell nucleus in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 7C,F). These results indicated that Esa inhibits osteoclastogenesis by suppressing MAPK and NF-κB signaling, in relation to PPAR-γ activation, to some extent.\\', \\'ref_181:Up to now, 6 protoilludene synthases from three species were identified (Additional file 1: Table S1). Among them, O.olearius protoilludene synthase (OMP7) exhibits the highest catalytic efficiency which is higher than its homologs OMP6 and Stehi1|73029 by 10 and 30 times, respectively. In order to synthesize protoilludene in E. coli, a codon-optimized OMP7 gene was assembled with E. coli FPP synthase gene (ispA) to construct plasmid pTAO (Fig. 2a). It was transformed into E. coli DH5α, resulting in the strain E. coli AO. This strain was then cultivated at 30 °C for 48 h in 2YT medium containing 2 % (v/v) of glycerol with overlaying 1 mL decane. Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis showed a new peak which was identified as protoilludene by gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC–MS), and corresponded to 1.14 mg/L of protoilludene. The tiny production could be ascribed to an insufficient supply of IPP and DMAPP from the native MEP pathway.Thus, the protoilludene synthesis plasmid pTAO was co-transformed with plasmid pSNA, which encodes a hybrid exogenous MVA pathway for sufficient supply of IPP and DMAPP, into E. coli DH5α, resulting in the strain E. coli AO/NA. Gas chromatographic analysis showed a specific peak with retention time of 5.7 min, which was subsequently confirmed as protoilludene by GC–MS (Fig. 2b). For 48 h of culture, the strain E. coli AO/NA produced 517 mg/L of protoilludene with an undesired accumulation of mevalonate as much as 571 mg/L (Fig. 2c), indicating the suboptimal performance of MVA pathway encoded by pSNA. It is thus required to redesign the MVA pathway, especially the lower portion of the MVA pathway for protoilludene production.Kinetic properties of homolog enzymes from different organisms are generally distinct from each other. Homolog enzymes of the lower MVA portion have also different kinetic properties. For example, S. pneumoniae mevalonate kinase (SnMvaK1) is subject to allosteric regulation by diphosphomevalonate, whereas S. aureus mevalonate kinase (SaMvaK1) without the allosteric regulation is competitively inhibited by isoprenyl diphosphates (DMAPP, IPP and FPP). A metabolic pathway of interest can be improved by substituting a problematic constituent enzyme with its homolog with a desirable property. In order to further improve the mevalonate pathway, the genes of the lower MVA portion MvL2 in pSMvL2 were substituted with their homologs from S. aureus, resulting into a new set of pSMvL7–13 plasmids (Fig. 5a). The effect of the lower MVA portions MvL7–13 on protoilludene production was investigated in combination with the upper MVA pathway portions MvUM and MvUH in the same manner used in Fig. 4c. The upper MVA portion MvUL was excluded in this study because it was suspected to produce insufficient amount of mevalonate for high production of protoilludene. The plasmids pSMvL7–13-MvUM were constructed to combine the upper portion MvUM and the lower portions MvL7–13(Additional file 1: Fig. S4). The combinations of MvUH and MvL7–13 were conducted by co-transformation of pTAO-MvUH and pSMvL7-13. Interestingly, the strains E. coli AO/M7 (pTAO/pSMvL7-MvUM) and E. coli AO/H7 (pTAO-MvUH and pSMvL7), containing the lower MVA portion MvL7 with homolog substitution of SaMvaK1 only, produced the enhanced protoilludene production of 1199 and 740 mg/L, respectively (Fig. 5b and Additional file 1: Table S3). Other homolog substitutions failed to improve production of protoilludene (Fig. 5b). As the homolog substitution of SaMvaK1 with no allosteric inhibition by diphosphomevalonate is effective for protoilludene production, it is suspected the accumulation of diphosphomevalonate in the strain E. coli AO/M2 harboring the lower MVA portion MvL2 due to some bottleneck in the conversion of diphosphomevalonate to IPP by diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase.\\', \\'ref_182:Cell-based screening identified that methanol extracts of SJSZ (10 μg/mL) strongly suppressed PC-3 cell viability. To determine the responsible constituents, we performed serial extraction (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol) and subsequent cell viability assays, and determined that the n-butanol extract strongly suppressed PC-3 cell viability (10 μg/mL each; Figure 1a). We further performed fractionation of the n-butanol extract, and again performed subsequent cell viability assays with the products, and identified that fractions 1, 5, and 6 suppressed PC-3 cell viability (Figure 1b). By LC/MS and NMR analyses, we found these fractions to contain jegosaponin A and jegosaponin B (Figure 1c), which suppressed PC-3 cell viabilities at lethal concentration 50 (LC50) = 0.7 ± 0.0 μM and 1.6 ± 0.3 μM, respectively (Figure 1d). In addition, we confirmed that these jegosaponins also suppressed the viability of other human prostate cancer cell lines, namely DU145 and LNCaP (Figure S1).As saponins are well-known non-ionic surfactants, which can induce permeabilization of the cell membrane, we measured the haemolytic activities of jegosaponin A and B in sheep red blood cells. As shown in Figure 3a, the concentrations of the 50% haemolytic dosage (HD50) in jegosaponin A and B were 2.1 ± 0.4 μM, and 20.2 ± 2.4 μM, respectively. To evaluate the jegosaponin-induced increase in cell membrane permeability in PC-3 cells, we administered DRAQ7, a cell-impermeable DNA staining far-red fluorescent dye, with jegosaponin A and B (Figure 3b; purple indicates DRAQ7-stained nucleus). The nucleus DNA was stained in a time-dependent manner after treatment with either jegosaponin (EC50 of jegosaponin A, 3.4 ± 0.6 μM; jegosaponin B, 6.0 ± 1.2 μM; Figure 3c), indicating that these jegosaponins disrupt the cell membrane to induce cytotoxicity. The negative control (0.1% DMSO) did not allow DRAQ7 to stain the nucleus. Next, we performed DRAQ7 treatment on zebrafish larvae to validate whether jegosaponins could increase cell permeability under in vivo conditions. As shown in Figure 3d, after 30 min of exposure, jegosaponin A and B apparently increased DRAQ7 signals (purple) mainly in the tail regions, indicating that the jegosaponins increased cell membrane permeability in zebrafish (48 hpf) skin, allowing DRAQ7 incorporation into the nuclear DNA. In addition, the high concentrations of jegosaponin A and B (6 μM, and 12 μM, respectively) killed all embryos for 60 min.\\', \"ref_183:In addition to the NOESY experiments quantum chemical calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/STO-3G** level as fully described in the supplementary data. In order to have a reliable starting point for the calculations molecular structures with 7- and 9-membered rings were searched in the Cambridge Structural Database, basically two different conformations for these rings were found (Figure S8). Unrestricted optimizations have been carried out for these conformers. The four stationary structures found for the 7-membered ring have similar energies (Table S1 and Figure S9). Nevertheless, the NBO steric analysis (Table 4) indicates that only the 74-conformer holds all spatial interactions noted by 1D-NOESY experiments. In fact the calculated 74-conformer was used to draw Figure 2. For sesquiterpene 2 also four conformers were found but in this case one of them, conformer 91, is much more stable as shown in Table S1. Moreover, the NBO steric analysis shows that this conformer has the strongest spatial interactions for the ones displayed by the 1D-NOESY experiments (Table 4). This conformation was the one used for drawing Figure 3. From the foregoing it is clear that the molecular modeling studies support the 1D-NOESY experimental results, thus proving that the 74- and 91-conformer describe the 3D structures of the 7- and 9- membered ring compounds, respectively.rel.-(2S,3S,6R)-6-(2-Hydroxypropan-2-yl)-3-methyl-2-(3-oxobutyl)cycloheptanone (7-epi-11-hydroxy-chabrolidione A, 1): Colorless oil; [α +50.7 (c 0.9, CHCl3); IR (KBr) νmax 3440, 2972, 2925, 2875, 1707, 1376 cm−1; 1H and 13C-NMR (CDCl3) see Table 1; HRESIMS (probe) 4.5 eV, positive mode, m/z (rel. int.): 277.1774 [M+Na]+ (C15H26O3+Na) (94) (calculated for C15H26O3+Na = 277.1774), 237.18 [M+H−H2O]+ (100); ESIMS 20 eV, positive mode, m/z (rel. int.): 237 (100), 235 (35).rel.-(5S,8R)-5,9,9-Trimethyl-8-(3-oxobutyl)oxonane-2,6-dione (holostylactone, 2): Colorless oil; [α −20.0 (c 1.0, CHCl3); IR (KBr) νmax 2912, 2862, 1732, 1707, 1389, 1100 cm−1; 1H and 13C-NMR (CDCl3) see Table 2; HRESIMS (probe) 4.5 eV, positive mode, m/z (rel. int.): 291.1567 (calc for C15H24O4+Na = 291.1567) (100) and m/z 269.1745 [M+H]+ (calc for C15H25O4 269.1747) (60); ESIMS 20 eV, positive mode, m/z (rel. int.): 269 (100), 251 (55), 233, [M+Na−H3CCOCH3] (18).(6S,7E,9S)-6,9-Dihydroxy-10-(2\\'-hydroxyethoxy)-4,7-megastigmadien-3-one (holostymegastigmadienone, 3): Yellow oil; [α +68.6 (c 0.9, MeOH); IR (KBr) νmax 3452, 1666, 1643, 1384 cm−1; 1H and 13C-NMR (DMSO-d6) see Table 3; HRESIMS (probe) 4.5 eV, positive mode, m/z (rel. int.): 307.1525 [M+Na]+ (100) (calculated for C15H24O5+Na = 307.1522); ESIMS 20 eV, positive mode, m/z (rel. int.): 307 (38), 277 (87), 275 (100), 237 (43), 205 (47), 130 (24).

We obtained a total of 55,166,532 and 54,784,414 raw reads from Pg-Con and Pg-MeJA respectively. By filtering all the raw reads, we obtained 52,821,238 (95.75%) clean reads from Pg-Con and 52,661,812 (96.13%) from Pg-MeJA with an average length of 90 bp. High-quality reads from two samples were combined and provided to the transcriptome assembly program \\'Trinity\\'. A total of 136,776 and 132,474 contigs were assembled with an average length of 316 and 307 bp and N50 of 525 and 448 bp from Pg-Con and Pg-MeJA respectively. Later, contigs were further assembled into 75,956 unigenes with a mean size of 698 bp from Pg-Con and 73,439 with a mean size of 690 bp from Pg-MeJA. There were 33,672 (≥500 bp) and 17,543 (≥1000 bp) unigenes in Pg-Con, while 32,393 (≥500 bp) and 16,598 (≥1000 bp) unigenes in Pg-MeJA. The majority of unigenes were smaller than 500 bp in both cases that accounted for approximately 56% of all unigenes. Finally, the unigenes from both samples were assembled into 71,095 all-unigenes in total, with a mean length of 871 bp and N50 of 1307. An overview of assembled sequences has been summarized in Table 1.Transcriptome sequencing is one of the most effective tools for gene identification. Understanding the transcriptome analysis is essential to know which genes are expressed at various developmental stages or physiological conditions of a cell. Plant genomics, especially for non-model species, is always hard due to its large and complex genome, high levels of ploidy and large proportions of repeat sequences. Instead of the whole genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing is a better alternative for rapid and efficient access to genetic information. High-throughput Illumina/Solexa sequencing technology has recently been an efficient, fast, inexpensive and reliable tool for transcriptome characterization and gene discovery in non-model organisms as well. Previously, a number of ESTs were generated from leaves, seeds, rhizomes and roots of P. ginseng by the Sanger sequencing technology. However, deep EST sequencing using this traditional method is highly expensive, labor intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, with the development of large scale genomics, the Sanger method could not meet the needs of the development. However, over the past few years, the NGS technologies have overcome the current limitations of the Sanger method and at the same time, the NGS platform has become the prime approach for high-throughput gene discovery on a genome-wide scale both for model and non-model organisms. These technologies can produce a large number of quality reads with high sampling rates of cDNA libraries providing a complete view of transcriptomes. Thus, plant genomics in recent years has developed rapidly with the application of various NGS technologies with respect to costs, efficiency and speed compared with that of the traditional Sanger method. Hence, over the past several years, these technologies have made a revolution in genomics and provided a rapid and economic way to sequence extremely large amounts of genetic material. Among NGS technologies, the Illumina/Solexa platform has been one of the most useful and widely used technologies due to its fast, inexpensive, accurate, efficient and reliable transcriptome characterization, gene discovery and various functional studies in many organisms. Using this technology, comprehensive sequencing resources have been successfully constructed from non-model plants including P. ginseng, Lentinula edodes and Auricularia polytricha. However, transcriptome assembly was highly challenging including mis-assembled contigs. Recently, \\'Trinity\\', a novel assembly method has been introduced most notably through an expand capability for transcriptome de novo assembly using relatively short reads. The results from this study suggested that short reads from Illumina/Solexa sequencing can effectively be assembled through \\'Trinity\\' giving the advantage of a high assurance and reliable assembly of putative unigenes, including potential and valuable splice variant information. Therefore, de novo sequencing and assembly of transcriptomes or genomes has effectively been utilized for model and non-model organisms. Despite the commercial and medicinal values of P. ginseng, NGS-based MeJA-elicited transcriptome information on this species in public databases was scarce prior to our study. In our work, Illumina/Solexa sequencing technology was applied to perform this work. Compared to the Sanger method, this technology provides a large amount of genetic resources in a fast, efficient and economic way. Through this program, we obtained about 55 millions raw reads separately from Pg-Con and Pg-MeJA and subsequently 53 millions clean reads from each sample. Finally, all of these clean reads assembled into 71,095 all-unigenes were annotated with five above mentioned main databases (Table S11). Furthermore, the Trinity assembly algorithm designed specifically for assembling of putative transcripts has also given us biologically significant results of high confidence. More recent works obtained similar advantages to the use of the Illumina HiSeq™2000 platform in the assembly of a transcriptome for untreated P. ginseng adventitious roots and Lentinula edodes C91-3 respectively. More importantly, stimulation of ginsenoside synthesis by MeJA is performed by the up-regulation of genes including SS, SE, and DDS involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis. Although many candidate genes related to ginsenoside biosynthesis have previously been identified both in untreated and MeJA treated P. ginseng, several genes encoding ginsenoside biosynthetic enzymes such as MVK, GPS, β-AS and DDS were not found. For example, DDS thought to be a rate-limiting and the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of dammarane-type saponins was absent in the 454 EST dataset of untreated P. ginseng roots. Some recent works have discovered only one unigene from 4-year-old untreated P. ginseng and three unigenes from American ginseng roots based on the 454 pyrosequencing method. In another case, only two up-regulated SS candidates were found from the same year-old MeJA-treated P. ginseng hairy roots via the traditional Sanger EST analyses. However, we have obtained 10 up-regulated SS unigenes from our dataset. Moreover, nearly all types of major ginsenoside biosynthetic enzyme genes were discovered in the transcriptome of our MeJA-treated P. ginseng adventitious roots (mentioned above). Based on comparison, the findings indicate that the information of this study is relatively comprehensive and highlights the immense capacity of both MeJA and Illumina/Solexa technology. On the other hand, only a few ABC transporters have been identified in medicinal plants related to ginsenosides and transport of other secondary metabolites. Moreover, several MeJA-induced plant PDRs have been discovered associated with defense reactions against pests, pathogens and herbivores by transporting antimicrobial natural secondary metabolites in cells. Based on the knowledge that secondary metabolites can be induced by MeJA, the identified 12 potential candidate PDR unigenes from our study through phylogenetic analysis will provide more important functions related to the transport of various substrates including secondary metabolites and their transport in cells. Moreover, the annotated unigenes and associated resources from our work provide valuable information for P. ginseng adventitious roots to investigate specific processes and allow the identification of novel genes related to ginsenosides and other secondary metabolites biosynthesis, their accumulation, as well as transport, that are responsive to MeJA treatment.\", \\'ref_185:On histopathological analysis, the heart tissue of mice that received DOX at a dose of 20 mg/kg showed disorganization and degeneration of the myocardium. Concomitant treatment with R-(-)-carvone revealed normal muscle fiber architecture (Figure 2). DOX treatment increased CK and LDH activities in serum (Table 1). Only the high dose of R-(-)-carvone (150 mg/kg) was able to lower the activities of both enzymes significantly in animals that received R-(-)-carvone along with DOX.Catalase activity was increased by R-(-)-carvone alone or by R-(-)-carvone/DOX combination in normal heart in vivo (Figure 4A). Similarly, both doses of R-(-)-carvone alone and the combination of R-(-)-carvone with DOX increased catalase activity in the H9C2 (Figure 4B).\\', \\'ref_186:Figure 4A shows a typical chromatogram of a blank blood sample obtained after sample preparation. No interfering endogenous substances eluting near the analyte or internal standard were observed. The peak of the agent K-142 in the chromatogram of a sample containing the substance at a concentration of 5 ng/mL (Figure 4B) has a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 248 that meets the validation criteria (S/N ≥ 5). The retention time of the internal standard is c.a. 4.2 min, and the peak at 3.0 min (Figure 4A) is caused by the divertor valve switching. Standard solutions of K-142 were prepared by spiking the substance solution in methanol into mice blood at 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2500 ng/mL concentration levels. The calibration curve with nine concentration levels was established. The calibration curve (Figure S2) was generated by plotting the peak area ratios of analyte/internal standard versus spiked analyte concentrations. The resulting calibration curve is described by the linear equation y = 4.94 × 10−4x + 8.87 × 10−4, and the correlation coefficient was calculated to be 0.9946. LLOQ, QCL and QCH samples were analyzed to assess accuracy and precision, analyses were performed on two different days. The concentrations of the agent K-142 were back-calculated using a calibration curve equation; the results obtained are shown in Table S2. CV values did not exceed 8.8% and 11.4% for intra-day and inter-day precision, respectively, and RE values for accuracy were less than 7.5%, indicating that the method was suitable for PK studies. The recovery measured for QCL and QCH samples was found to be 33% and 30%, respectively. The obtained values indicate quite poor extraction of the substance from mice blood, which may be caused by its strong binding to red blood cells and/or matrix proteins. Matrix factor for QCL and QCH samples was found to be of 90.8% and 95.2%, respectively, indicating weak influence of matrix components on the analyte signal intensity. Analysis of the ULOQ sample (the spike containing K-142 at the concentration of 2500 ng/mL) showed that the residual amount of the substance corresponded to its concentration of c.a. 0.5–0.7 ng/mL, which was less than 20% of that for LLOQ and followed the regulatory documents. The method has been applied to a pharmacokinetic study of the agent K-142 in mice (n = 8). The substance was administered to the animals orally at a dose of 20 mg/kg. After drug administration, blood samples were taken from the tail vein and treated with the precipitating solution, and the samples were analyzed. Figure 5A shows the individual concentration-time profiles for each animal. It can be noted that the dependencies for the main group are similar, but those for two mice (#3 and #8 on the graph) differ from the others. Apparently, in animal #3 there was a one-step absorption of the agent followed by its rapid excretion, whereas in animal #8 there seemed to be little bioavailability of the agent. The graph representing the average pharmacokinetics profile is shown in Figure 5B. As can be seen from the graphs in Figure 5, when the substance is administered orally, its absorption is fairly rapid, and the maximum concentration is reached 10 min after administration. The maximum values of concentrations observed for animals vary in the range from 15 to 90 ng/mL, and the average value is about 46 ng/mL. Thereafter, the content of the substance in the blood gradually decreases, and almost complete excretion is achieved in about 2 h. As the average concentration of K-142 in mice blood was c.a. 3.1 ng/mL, which is below LLOQ, this time point was not included in calculation of pharmacokinetics parameters and is shown in Figure 5 just for information. Due to the same reason, the data on the concentrations of the agent K-142 in animal #8 were also not taken into account for the calculation. The averaged values of pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for a period of time from 0 to 60 min and are given in Table 1.The compound under investigation, K-142, is a conjugate of a monoterpene α-pinene and coumarin, therefore, its physicochemical properties and metabolism will be determined primarily by these fragments. Thus, it is known that main metabolism of α-pinene in humans is its rapid oxidation on the CH2-group, resulting in the formation of corresponding diastereomeric verbenols. In addition to this, it was established that epoxidation of the double bond of the six-member cycle can occur. Coumarin itself is also rapidly metabolized when administered to animals. It was shown that its major pathway is 7-hydroxylation in humans and epoxidation followed by formation of a series of hydroxylated derivatives in rats and mice. The hydroxylated metabolites then undergo sulfation or glucuronidation and are excreted mostly with urine and feces. Pharmacokinetics parameters calculated for K-142 are in agreement with those determined for different coumarin derivatives bearing isoprene moieties. Thus, oral administration of osthenol to ICR mice at a dose of 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg resulted in the following PK parameters: Cmax of 66.1 ± 3.2 and 56.0 ± 29.1 ng/mL, respectively, and Tmax of 36.3 ± 13.8 and 6.3 ± 1.3 min, respectively, indicating the very low bioavailability of the compound as well as its non-linear pharmacokinetics. Oral administration of auraptene to rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg provided the maximum concentration of the compound in blood plasma of 1719 ± 384.3 ng/mL and Tmax of 108.0 ± 25.3 min, and the bioavailability of auraptene was determined to be 8.5%. Taking into account the data mentioned above, we suppose that the agent K-142 can be metabolized rapidly after administration to animals and metabolized in the first pass, and the search for metabolites of K-142 will be the objective of our next studies. Thus, a method for quantification of a new perspective agent possessing anti-RSV properties was developed, validated and applied for pharmacokinetics studies of a coumarin derivative, agent K-142. The obtained results indicate that to achieve higher concentrations of the compound in animals, it is necessary to investigate its different dosage forms and possibly increase its dose.\\', \\'ref_187:Presence of toxoids in the extract of isolated endophytes was monitored by HPLC analysis (Fig. 3). Detected toxoids were structurally confirmed by LC–Ms (Fig. S2). The ]M\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009H[ peak calculated at, 545 m/z for DAB, 587 m/z for baccatin III, 812 m/z for 10 Deacetyl taxol and 7-epi 10-deacetyl taxol, 832 m/z for Cephalomanine, 854 m/z for Taxol and 7-epiTaxol (Fig. S2). Eighteen isolated endophytes contained taxanes, among which five species i.e., CA12, CA3, CA16, CA18, CA2, showed remarkable total amounts of taxanes in solid media (Table 3). In addition, CA7, CA15, CA2, CA18, CA3, CA11, and CA1 were the most taxan producing endophytes in liquid culture conditions (Table 4). The main taxoid of fungi that accumulated in solid and liquid media were DAB, followed by 10-deacetyl paclitaxel, cephalomannine, and Taxol, (Tables 3 and 4), and the highest alteration in the quantities of taxanes after transition from solid to liquid media was observed in DAB (Table 4). On the other hand, 7- epitaxol was detected in lower quantities than other taxanes in liquid media. Except for CA3, CA4, CA12 and CA16 whose total taxan contents were reduced in liquid media, for other species transfer to liquid culture was accompanied by significant increase of total taxan content and induction of certain taxoids (Table 4). As an instance, baccatin III that was not observed in solid culture of CA2, CA3, CA8, CA9, CA16, was remarkably induced by transferring the fungi into liquid medium. Likewise, cephalomannine was not detected in solid culture of CA3, CA7, and CA16 but dramatically induced in liquid media (Tables 3 and 4). It is noteworthy however that the potential to produce a given taxoid compound was not equal for all isolated endophytes. For example, CA7 produced the greatest amount of DAB (70.2 mg/L), while CA16 showed the highest 10-deacetyltaxol (11.8 mg/L) and CA1 produced the greatest amount of Taxol (7.5 mg/L) (Table 4).During 21 days growth in liquid culture, the endophytes released 9- 90% of Taxoids into their media (Table 5). The most specific yield of toxoids respectively belonged to CA7, CA2, and CA15, while the specific yield of other endophytes were much lower (Table 5). Changes of mycelial membrane lipid peroxidation rate and conductivity of the medium are shown in Fig. 4. Electrolyte leakages of CA3, CA4, CA8, CA11, and CA18 increased during growth in liquid media and it was parallel with increase of their MDA (Fig. 4). For other endophytes however, no conclusive relationship was observed between EC and MDA (Fig. 4). Evaluation of cytotoxicity of isolated endophytes on MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed that the extract of almost all fungi had potential to inhibit the growth of cancer cells (Fig. 5). Except for CA2, CA6, CA12, and CA18 cytotoxicity of suspension media grown fungi were higher (lower LC50) than those in solid ones (Fig. 5). In liquid media, CA1 and CA12 showed the most and the lowest inhibitory potential, respectively (Fig. 5). In solid cultures, CA2 and CA14 showed the highest and the lowest inhibitory effects, respectively (Fig. 5).\\', \\'ref_188:No previous studies have reported the biological activity of ATS-E3, a novel triterpenoid saponin isolated from Camellia sinensis; therefore, we aimed to evaluate its pharmacological activity under macrophage-mediated inflammatory conditions. To start this study, we first examined the cytotoxic activity of ATS-E3 in macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells. As Figure 2(a) shows, there was no significant toxic effect affecting cell viability under the treatment of this compound up to 10 μM, indicating that the activity of ATS-E3 at 0 to 10 μM concentration ranges could be due to its specific pharmacological activities. During innate immune responses, the primary function of macrophages is to phagocytose infected or exogenous materials. Such phagocytic ability can be easily mimicked with macromolecules labeled with FITC. In fact, FITC-dextran showed a 10-fold increase in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells (Figure 2(b)), as assessed by flow cytometric analysis in a previous report. Interestingly, ATS-E3 blocked phagocytosis of FITC-dextran in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2(b), left panel). Moreover, the IKK inhibitor BAY 11-7082 also significantly diminished the uptake of FITC-dextran, indicating that phagocytosis of FITC-dextran by macrophages is dependent on IKK/NF-κB (Figure 2(b), right panel), as reported previously.Additional functions of macrophages include the release of large amounts of toxic molecules such as ROS and RNS, which cause cellular damage in tissues or organs and lead to loss of function due to inflammation. Therefore, we next examined whether ATS-E3 could neutralize toxic molecules by using the radical generator SNP. To produce antioxidative activity under cellular conditions, we also used RAW264.7 cells treated with SNP. As shown in Figure 2(c), this compound completely neutralized the generated radicals. Since triterpenoid saponins such as parkioside B from the root bark of Butyrospermum parkii, 3β-O-α-l-arabinopyranosyl-19α,23-dihydroxy-20α-urs-12-en-28-oic acid 28-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester from the aerial parts of Ilex cornuta, and 3β-hydroxy-23-oxo-30-noroleana-12,20(29)-diene-28-oic acid 3-O-β-d-glucuronopyranosyl-28-O-β-d-glucopyranoside from Salicornia herbacea display strong antioxidative activity, the scavenging action of ATS-E3 may be due to their phytochemical properties. Therefore, these results imply that ATS-E3 can downregulate phagocytosis and prevent the generation of radicals mediated by the functional activation of macrophages.\\', \\'ref_189:Patchouli alcohol is one of the important compounds isolated from the essential oil of Pogostemon cablin (patchouli), in parallel with tomatidine as a glycoalkaloid and an agly-cone metabolite of tomatidine which is largely present in high amount in unripe tomato and were tested here, for the first time for their potential effect as anti-SARS-CoV-2, using in silico methods. Proteases 3CLpro and PLpro were targeted to virtually identify the potential drug specifically blocking its catalytic dyad and triad, respectively. Their inhibition plays a pivotal role either in stopping the production of functional SARS-CoV-2 polypeptides or in reducing the viral replication on the host.The docking method involves searching for binding sites on the whole macromolecular surface. Therefore, (SARS-CoV-2) inhibitors were used for blind docking analysis of the known drugs, tomatidine and patchouli alcohol. The protein-ligand interactions of the stable docked complexes were investigated. According to the docking score and binding mode analyses, both leads were found to tightly bind to the different selected targets.As shown (Figure 1), tomatidine interacts to 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) via van der Waals interactions with Thr25, Leu27, His41, Met49, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, His164, Glu166, Leu167, Arg188, Gln189 and Thr190, unfavorable donor-donor interactions with Thr26 and Alkyl interactions with Cys145, Met165 and Pro168, amino-acids, however patchouli alcohol established van der Waals interactions with His41, Met49, Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His164, Glu166 and Gln189, and Alkyl interactions with His163, Met165 and His172 residues. In such a case, all the residues involved in the interaction sites of the tomatidine-3CLpro complex, and patchouli alcohol-3CLpro are located in the preferred high-volume pocket of 3CLpro having Thr24, Thr25, Thr26, Leu27, His41, Cys44, Thr45, Ser46, Met49, Pro52, Tyr54, Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His163, His164, Met165, Glu166, Leu167, Pro168, His172, Asp187, Arg188, Gln189, Thr190 and Gln192 residues. We note also the presence of both Cys145 and His41 catalytic dyad in tomatidine-3CLpro complex, and patchouli alcohol-3CLpro active center known for their major role in substrate binding and the enzyme activity.Regarding the binding mode of tomatidine and patchouli alcohol with target 3Clpro, our results are in good agreement with what has been proven for SARS-CoV-2 NSP15 indicating that His235, Gln245, Gly248, Gln294 and Thr341 were the main residues in NSP15 active site. We note also that both tomatidine and patchouli alcohol do interact with the important catalytic residue Lys290 via van der Waals and H-bonds interactions, respectively, which is involved preferentially in the hydrolysis of a nucleoside as observed from SARS and MERS NSP15. Interestingly, the residue His235 which is pivotal for hydrolysis was found in. Additionally, hydroxyl groups of Ser294 and Tyr343 residues which are close to the catalytic residues and may be responsible for the binding of the substrate also make hydrogen bonds with ligands in the models. Moreover, in the case of MERS (NSP15), the importance of the residue Tyr343 for ribonuclease activity has been demonstrated by mutational studies.\\', \\'ref_190:Next, the sensitivity of NPs to ROS was investigated by evaluating the size changes and in vitro drug release of iRGD-TK-NPs and iRGD-CC-NPs under various ROS conditions. As shown in Figure 3(A,B), iRGD-CC-NPs maintained a stable particle size at pH 7.4 both with or without 10.0 mM H2O2, suggesting the ROS-insensitivity of iRGD-CC-NPs. Similarly, the size of iRGD-TK-NPs in PBS without H2O2 was also stable during the incubation time. However, the diameter of iRGD-TK-NPs changed from 85 to 145 nm and 706 nm after culturing in PBS containing 10.0 mM H2O2 for 2 h and 12 h, respectively, demonstrating the high ROS-responsiveness of iRGD-TK-NPs. To further confirm ROS sensitivity, in vitro UA release behaviors of iRGD-TK-NPs were also evaluated, and the results are shown in Figure 3(C). It was found that the UA released from iRGD-TK-NPs showed H2O2-concentration-dependence. Negligible UA release from iRGD-TK-NPs occurred in the absence of ROS. When the addition of H2O2, UA release behavior was enhanced and sustained. In the presence of 1 mM H2O2, around 25% of UA was released from NPs after 48 h incubation. Interestingly, NPs underwent rapid release within 6 h under 10.0 mM H2O2, with about 65% UA release after incubation for 48 h. These results further confirm the high ROS sensitivity of iRGD-TK-NPs, which could promote the rapid conversion of the UA prodrug into the active parent drug, and ultimately enhance the antitumor effect of UA. After reaching tumor tissue, the absence of cell-specific interaction between NPs and cells could induce insufficient cell uptake of NPs and drug expulsion, ultimately decreasing the antitumor effect, and even induce multidrug resistance (Wei et al.,; Yang et al.,; Mahmoudi Saber,). The use of surface-modified targeting ligands is an effective strategy to overcome this problem. Herein, we incorporated iRGD into UA-based DPNS to increase its tumor-targeting ability. CLSM and FCM were performed to evaluate the ability of iRGD-TK-NPs to target cancer cells using the human GC SGC 7901 cell line (a cell line that has been reported to highly overexpress αvβ3 integrins) and the normal NIH-3T3 cell line (Shi et al.,). In the CLSM images of both cells (Figure 4(A)), the intracellular concentration of iRGD-modified NPs (iRGD-TK-NPs and iRGD-CC-NPs) and no-iRGD-modified NPs (TK-NPs and CC-NPs) was increased from 1 h to 3 h, evidenced by the enhancement in the green fluorescence signal of coumarin-6 with prolonged incubation time, indicating that four NPs could effectively deliver UA into cancer cells. However, at the same time interval, the green fluorescence intensity in iRGD-modified NPs-treated SGC 7901 cells was remarkably higher than that of without iRGD-modified NPs. Additionally, no significant difference was observed between iRGD-TK-NPs and iRGD-CC-NPs in SGC 7901 cells. The fluorescence in SGC 7901 cells between TK-NPs and CC-NPs was also no remarkable difference. These results were also quantitatively verified by FCM. As shown in Figure 4(B), the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in SGC-7901 cells incubated with iRGD-TK-NPs and iRGD-CC-NPs for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h was 1.1-/1.3-fold, 1.2-/1.4-fold, 1.3-/1.5-fold, and 1.5-/1.6-fold higher than in the TK-NPs-treated group, respectively. The MFI in SGC 7901 cells incubated with iRGD-TK-NPs and iRGD-CC-NPs for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h was 1.4-/1.6-fold, 1.6-/1.5-fold, 1.4-/1.4-fold, and 1.3-/1.4-fold higher than in the CC-NPs-treated group, respectively. Moreover, MFI of coumarin-6 in the normal NIH-3T3 cells (Figure 4(C)) after culturing with NPs coated with or without iRGD showed no remarkable difference over the same period. These results suggest that NPs modified with iRGD can be specifically and selectively internalized by cancer cells through iRGD-mediated internalization. In vitro cytotoxicity assayed by the MTT method against SGC 7901 and NIH-3T3 cells were used to validate whether the iRGD-TK-NPs could effectively suppress the growth of cancer cells. The relative cell viability and IC50 value of all formulations are shown in Figure 5. In normal NIH-3T3 cells (Figure 5(A)), the four NPs showed slight suppression of cell proliferation (IC50 value >50 µg/mL, Figure 5(C)), caused by intracellular incomplete drug release, because of the low level of ROS in NIH-3T3 cells. For SGC 7901 cells, as presented in Figure 5(B), all formulations exhibited dose-dependent cell proliferation-inhibiting effects, and iRGD-TK-NPs showed higher cytotoxic activity. The IC50 value of iRGD-TK-NPs was 7.2 µg/mL, which was 1.4-fold, 2.4-fold, 2.4-fold, and 15.7-fold lower than that of free UA, TK-NPs, CC-NPs, and iRGD-CC-NPs, respectively (Figure 5(C)). The low cytotoxicity of free UA may mainly due to poor water solubility. The enhancement in vitro antitumor effect of iRGD-TK-NPs relative to TK-NPs was attributed to iRGD-mediated active targeting of cancer cells; this result was well consistent with the above cellular uptake results. Considering the cell internalization process of both iRGD-coated NPs, the lower cytotoxic activity of iRGD-CC-NPs was mainly due to intracellular slow and incomplete UA release. This phenomenon was also observed between TK-NPs and CC-NPs. As the NPs designed and prepared here are administered via intravenous injection, their biocompatibility in the blood is very important. Therefore, the hemolytic analysis was performed before in vivo study to evaluate biocompatibility. As shown in Figure 6(A), all NPs showed good blood compatibility with a hemolysis ratio of lower than 5% at the UA concentration range of 0.01–1 mg/mL. Subsequently, the pharmacokinetics of all UA formulations were investigated using the SD rat as the tumor model, and the results are shown in Figure 6(B). UA was rapidly cleared from the blood, and no drug could be detected after administration for 12 h. In contrast, all NPs significantly increased the retention time of UA in blood, and about 7.0, 8.9, and 6.2 µg/mL of UA iRGD-TK-NPs, TK-NPs, and iRGD-CC-NPs, respectively, in blood at 24 h post-injection. The area under the curve (AUC) of UA in iRGD-TK-NPs, TK-NPs, and iRGD-CC-NPs was 7.4-fold, 7.8-fold, and 6.8-fold higher than that of free UA, respectively. It is worth noting that the pharmacokinetic behavior of iRGD-TK-NPs, TK-NPs, and iRGD-CC-NPs did not significantly differ, indicating that the iRGD modification on the surface of NPs and difference in linkages between the two drug molecules did not remarkably influence the pharmacokinetic behavior of the prodrugs. The prolonged blood circulation could be attributed to NPs aggregating in tumor tissue through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect-mediated passive-targeting. We next evaluated the biodistribution of all UA formulations in SGC 7901 tumor-bearing mice. After a single intravenous injection at the dose of 11 mg/kg (equal to UA), the UA and UA-prodrugs in the major organs and tumor tissues at 6 h and 24 h postinjection were measured by HPLC. As described in Figure 6(C,D), after administration, free UA mainly accumulated in the liver and kidney and was cleared as time passed. The accumulated amount of free UA in tumor tissue was significantly lower than that of TK-NPs, iRGD-TK-NPs, and iRGD-CC-NPs both at 6 h and 12 h after administration. The total amount of free UA in tumor tissue was 3.2-/3.2-fold, 5.1-/5.7-fold, and 5.0-/5.6-fold lower than that of TK-NPs, iRGD-TK-NPs, and iRGD-CC-NPs post-injection for 6 h and 24 h, respectively. High levels of tumor accumulation of TK-NPs are mainly attributed to ERP effect-mediated tumor passive targeting. As expect, iRGD-coated NPs showed high levels of tumor targeting, and the concentration of iRGD-TK-NPs and iRGD-CC-NPs in tumor tissue was 1.6-/1.5-times and 1.8-/1.7-times higher than that of TK-NPs at 6 h and 12 h post-injection, respectively. This is attributed to iRGD-mediated active targeting and EPR effect-mediated passive targeting. Moreover, the concentration of iRGD-TK-NPs and iRGD-CC-NPs in tumor tissue was not significantly different in the same period. Finally, mice bearing SGC 7901 tumors were used as animal models to investigate the in vivo antitumor effect of all UA formulations. The profile of changes in tumor volume, tumor weights at day 21, and TSR is shown in Figure 7(A–C). Compared with saline, free UA elicited moderate tumor inhibition and TSR only 45.0%. The poor in vivo antitumor effect of free UA is attributed to its poor solubility, short blood circulation time, and low accumulation in tumor tissue. In contrast, iRGD-TK-NPs showed the best out of antitumor effect, and its TSR was 86.5%, which was 1.4-fold and 3.7-fold higher than that of TK-NPs and iRGD-CC-NPs, respectively. The good antitumor effect of iRGD-TK-NPs is attributable to specific tumor-targeting and intracellular rapid and complete drug release. Additionally, body weights of mice in all formulation-treatment groups had no significant decrease (Figure 7(D)), indicating that these UA formulations show good biocompatibility.In summary, a novel and simple ROS-responsive UA-based DPSN (iRGD-TK-NPs) was rationally designed and prepared in this study, and shown to exhibit significantly improved solubility and prolong the blood circulation time of UA. IRGD-TK-NPs have suitable zeta potentials, appropriate particle sizes, uniform spherical shape, high drug loading, and excellent biostability.\\', \\'ref_191:The ISO Standard 11024 is a targeted analysis that focuses on the percentage abundance of seven target components within a sample of lavender essential oil sample. The target components are 1, 8-cineole, cis-β-ocimene, linalool, 1-octen-3-yl acetate, camphor, linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate. This section investigates the limits of applying such a targeted simplistic approach to a highly complex biological sample that is subject to high levels of natural variation.The lavender reference standard was analyzed for the presence of 1,8-cineole, cis-β-ocimene, linalool, 1-octen-3-yl acetate, camphor, linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate. Analytical conditions were optimized in order to acquire reproducible and valid data for the analysis and subsequent predictive modelling. Alkane internal standards (C8–C22) were used during the analyses for the determination of linear retention indices (LRI) and assay performance. Relative standard deviations (%RSDs) were calculated to be between 3.6–13.3% for the 13 individual alkane standards, with a mean %RSD of 5.7 ± 2.5 (n = 7). The target compounds of 1,8-cineole, cis-β-ocimene, linalool, 1-octen-3-yl acetate, camphor, linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate were found to account for ca. 74.5% (1.8% RSD) of each oil analyzed in terms of peak area. Furthermore, Table 1 illustrates that the relative percentage peak area of each target component meet the requirements outlined in the ISO standard 11024. Table 1 also details the retention time and calculated LRI of the target compounds.Analysis of 30 high quality and 27 lower grade oils as per ISO Standard 11024 indicated that the seven target compounds used to characterize the lavender oil samples were all present (Figure 1). Statistical analysis of these compounds and their relative composition in the high quality and lower grade oils concluded that these oils are significantly different (Table 2), albeit within acceptable compositional ranges as per the ISO Standard 11024. The ratio of t-statistic and t-critical values (t-stat: t-crit.) in two sample t-Test analysis and the ratio of F-value and F-critical value (F: F-crit.) in a single factor ANOVA analysis indicate that the mean values of the target compounds within the two varieties of lavender oil were significantly different from each other thus indicating the varying quality in the two oil cohorts (Table 2). However, as described in the following section, the utilization and application of the target compounds alone in a predicative model was found to be unreliable.As illustrated in Table 2, the %RSD of the major compounds, linalyl acetate and linalol, were 4 and 4–6% for higher and lower graded oils, respectively. The %RSD for other compounds, which are reportedly found at lower concentrations varied significantly with a range of 14–64%. However, it is noteworthy to mention that both oil classes were within acceptable percentage composition ranges that are classified as lavender essential oils.Using ISO Standard 11024, all lavender samples tested were successfully identified as being lavender essential oil. However, the ISO Standard 11024 cannot reliably distinguish between the two classes which as pointed out earlier in the introduction section of this report, which is of great monetary importance to the industry. The specification limits applied in the ISO Standard 11024 for the percentage abundance of the targeted compounds are not stringent enough to differentiate between the two classes. A simple solution would be to recommend that tighter specifications be set for the targeted compounds in the ISO Standard 11024 test method but this would be a great over simplification. Applying such stringent specifications to only a small number of target compounds within such a variable and complex matrix will be problematic for the industry to administer as the probability for miss identifications will be significant and costly.The data acquired from the targeted ISO Standard 11024 GC-MS analysis of the essential oil samples was further analyzed using multivariate discrimination techniques, such as principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discrimination analysis (PLS-DA). This expands on the simplistic approach of individual percentage abundance specifications for each targeted compound and focuses on correlations between the percentage abundance of the targeted compounds.As illustrated in Figure 2, all the high-quality oil samples analyzed (represented by the blue circles) were predominately distributed in the left hemisphere of the PCA scatter plot (Figure 2A). Conversely, the lower grade oil samples (represented by the red circles) were present predominately in the right hemisphere of the PCA scatter plot, with a few samples positioned in the left hemisphere. This indicates reasonable separation between the two sample cohorts. The R2X, and Q2 values obtained for the PCA analysis were observed to be 0.825 and 0.580, respectively, thereby providing a weaker predictive model. This is representative of a model that fits the data well but has weak-to-fair predictive capabilities (Q2 ~ 0.6). As illustrated by the t-stat.: t-crit. values in the two sample t-test analysis and the F:F-crit. values in the single factor ANOVA analysis values in Table 2, the variation between samples within each cohort is significant and statistically the two cohorts are not classed as the same. The PCA analysis could not distinguish between the two classes with reliable predictability possibly due to the limited focus on the seven targeted compounds. This shows that the simple application of more stringent specifications to the percentage abundance of the seven targeted compounds to distinguish between oil classes will be problematic. To develop a predictive model with a stronger predictive capability (Q2), the analysis needs to be broadened beyond the seven targeted compounds and include all identified compounds (170) found in the GCMS analysis of the lavender essential oil samples.A partial least square discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) is applied to the untargeted GC-MS data set which identified 170 possible compounds. The subsequent PLS-DA Score and Scatter plots were generated using the untargeted data and are presented in Figure 3A,B, respectively. A Distance of Observation (DModX) analysis was used to identify and eliminate any outliers that may be present. DModX is the normalized observational distance between a variable set and X modal plane and is proportional to the variable residual standard deviation. ‘DCrit (critical value of DModX)’, derived from the F-distribution calculates the size of the observational area under analysis. As illustrated in Figure 3C, the DModX plot of the PLS-DA data indicated that no sample exceeded the threshold for rejecting a sample. Where the threshold for a moderate outlier to be rejected is identified when the sample DModX value is twice the DCrit at 0.05, which in this instance was 2.452 (DCrit = 1.226).The objective of the PLS-DA analysis was to increase the predictive capability of the model, in addition to identify the peaks that provide the greatest differentiation between the high quality and lower grade oil samples. As such, the R2X, R2Y and Q2 values for the PLS-DA model were 0.903, 0.990 and 0.970, respectively, thereby providing greater predictability than the model created using targeted data. Plotting a volcano plot of the −log10 p-value for each peak detected against the log2 Fold Change (FC) displays the GC-MS data in way that clearly distinguishes the two cohorts and identifies the features that explain the differentiation between the sample cohorts. Figure 4 presents the volcano plot of the GC-MS data, and Figure 5 presents the top 15 compounds identified as a result of the volcano plot. It is noted that these compounds could not be identified using the Adam’s essential oils reference library with any real confidence (library match ≥70%) and additional work is needed to identify and characterize them in terms of lavender quality. However, for the work presented in this paper, their identification is not necessary as it will have no bearing on the effectiveness of the developed PLS-DA model to predict which cohort an unknown sample belongs to.In order to evaluate and assess the predicative capability of the developed PLS-DA model, 9 unknown samples were analyzed according to the method described herein and applied to the PLS-DA model. As illustrated in Table 3, the three unknown samples either strongly correlated with the high quality or lower grade oil cohorts. Correlation for the high quality oils are observed when the YPredPS (Y Predicted list for PLS-DA model) value is nearest to 1, where 1 is defined as being equal to the cohort reference material. Considering the oils sampled are natural, some variation is to be expected. As evident in Table 3, six of the unknown samples were characterized as belonging to the high quality oil cohort while three unknowns were characterized as belonging to the lower grade oil cohort. Furthermore, a misclassification analysis of the entire dataset indicates that 100% of the data was successfully classified, with a Fisher probability test of 7.1 × 10−16. It is important to note, the misclassification analysis includes the 30 high quality and 24 lower grade oil samples, in addition to the unknown samples. A summary of the misclassification analysis is presented in Table 4.\\', \\'ref_192:In plant science, there are some studies on the effect of carvacrol against plant pathogens, including soil-borne pathogens, plant-parasitic nematodes, foliar pathogens, and postharvest pathogens (Table 1). However, fewer studies have been conducted to evaluate its effect on plant diseases of the above-ground parts of the plants. Recently, small molecules including carvacrol have been studied by our group for their potential in managing important diseases on tomato and squash. The goal of this short communication was to present the critical findings of our studies on carvacrol, to discuss future developments on effective applications of carvacrol in managing plant pathogens, and to explore its potential as an alternative tool in management of main diseases of vegetable crops important in south Florida of the United States. In studying carvacrol for its antimicrobial activity, the widely used agar diffusion method is considered inappropriate due to its volatile character, whereas the agar broth or liquid broth cultures are recommended. In our study, it was found that carvacrol was effective in inhibiting mycelial growth of Phytophthora capsici on agar media, however, its efficacy decreased by about 50% when 1-week old media amended with carvacrol was used compared to those freshly prepared at the day (Figure 1). Therefore, care needs to be taken for the age of the media after carvacrol is amended into the media when carvacrol is assessed for its inhibitory effect on mycelial growth of fungi or fungal-like microorganisms.Most studies on essential oils and their major components including carvacrol in the reviews mentioned previously were conducted in vitro. In our study, carvacrol was found to be effective against pathogens isolated from vegetable crops in south Florida. Carvacrol significantly (P < 0.05) reduced mycelia growth of Fusarium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani (from tomato) at 0.25 mM, and completely inhibited mycelial growth at 0.5 mM (Table 2). Against an isolate of Phytophthora capsici (from squash), carvacrol reduced mycelial growth by 70% and 91% at 0.25 and 0.5 mM, respectively, and completely inhibited mycelial growth at 1.0 mM (Figure 1). In nutrient broth, carvacrol showed inhibitory effect at 0.5 mM or lower concentrations on the population growth of Xanthomonas perforans, the causal pathogen of bacterial spot on tomato in Florida. Bactericidal effect was first shown at 0.5 mM, and clearly detected at 0.75 mM and greater concentrations (Table 2). Both inhibitory and bactericidal effects were dose-related. These results indicated that carvacrol can be effective at very low concentrations against both fungal and bacterial pathogens, and can be used as an alternative to synthesized chemicals in control of major diseases of vegetable crops with development of suitable formulations, particularly for organic vegetable production. Carvacrol was earlier found to be effective in reducing bacterial populations within 1 h or shorter time of contact. Interestingly, in our study, similar results were also found with carvacrol, and the population of X. perforans was reduced to undetectable levels after 2 h incubation with carvacrol at 0.75 mM (Table 2). In another study, carvacrol at 0.5% for 1 minute during a flume-tank-washing process reduced populations of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to undetectable levels on three leafy vegetables. Such treatments could be applied potentially as an alternative to bleach used in processing water in packing house for fresh market tomato and other tropical fruit to reduce incidence of fruit decay during storage and shipment. Furthermore, such inhibitory or bactericidal /fungicidal effects of carvacrol can be enhanced in an acidic condition or in combination with another chemical such as nisin.\\', \\'ref_193:To implement the CRISPR/Cas9 system in YM25235, Cas9-expressed YM25235 hosts were first developed. The pRH2034 plasmid was used as the backbone for Cas9 expression (Fig. 3), and this plasmid was used for transforming the YM25235 strain. Next, the Western blotting analysis of the cell lysates of nine transformants was performed. The results showed that 6*His-NLS-fused Cas9 (~\\\\u2009162\\\\u2009kDa) was expressed (Supplementary Table S2) in five transformants: YM25235-Cas9–1, YM25235-Cas9–2, YM25235-Cas9–3, YM25235-Cas9–7, and YM25235-Cas9–9 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The transformant YM25235-Cas9–7 exhibited the highest relative expression levels of Cas9 and was used in subsequent experiments, designated as YM25235-Cas9.The growth of the YM25235 and YM25235/RKCrtYBΔ strains, cultured at moderate (30\\\\u2009°C) and low (15\\\\u2009°C) temperatures, was analyzed. The growth of both strains was lower at 15\\\\u2009°C than at 30\\\\u2009°C. Additionally, at 15\\\\u2009°C, the YM25235/RKCrtYBΔ strain did not grow as well as the YM25235 strain. However, at 30\\\\u2009°C, the two strains showed similar growth (Fig. 8). These results indicated that the YM25235 strain could adapt and grow well at a low temperature through the regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis.\\', \\'ref_194:化合物 **1** 无色针状结晶 (CH3OH); mp 168~169 ℃; IR (microscope) *ν*max 3 528, 3 090, 2 980, 2 949, 1 766, 1 647, 1 435, 1 386, 1 303, 1 243, 1 196, 1 113 cm-1; HR-TOF-MS *m*/*z* 291.160 2 [M+H]+ (计算值 291.159 6); 1H NMR 和13C NMR 数据见表 1。**1a**: [*α*] +62.0 (*c* 0.1, CH3OH); ECD (MeOH) *λ*max (Δ*ε*) 225 (-0.40), 249 (+5.63)。**1b**: [*α*] -82.0 (*c* 0.1, CH3OH); ECD (MeOH) *λ*max (Δ*ε*) 224 (+1.39), 249 (-7.45)。化合物 **1** 为无色针状结晶 (甲醇), 分子式为 C17H22O4, *M* = 290.35, 单斜晶系, 晶胞参数为 *a* = 12.827 2 (3) Å, *b* = 9.330 0 (2) Å, *c* = 12.841 4 (3) Å, *β* = 101.947 (2)°, *U* = 1 503.54 (6) Å3, *T* = 108.0 (10), 空间群为 P21/c (no. 14), *Z* = 4, *μ* (Cu K*α*) = 0.734, 收集衍射点数为 7 114, 独立衍射点数 2 862 (*R*int = 0.028 7), w*R* (*F*2) 为 0.116 8。**1a**: [*α*] +62.0 (*c* 0.1, CH3OH); ECD (MeOH) *λ*max (Δ*ε*) 225 (-0.40), 249 (+5.63)。**1b**: [*α*] -82.0 (*c* 0.1, CH3OH); ECD (MeOH) *λ*max (Δ*ε*) 224 (+1.39), 249 (-7.45)。\\', \\'ref_195:The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), also called the citric acid cycle, is known as a central metabolic hub which can maintain cells in a steady state. The TCA cycle begins with the condensation of acetyl-COA with oxaloacetate to form citric acid. This cycling process produces ATP, which provides energy for the cells. Thus, citric acid, as the first intermediate in the TCA cycle, performs a critical role in the energy metabolism. Moreover, changes in pyruvate levels, another important metabolite of the TCA cycle and also a key substrate for the three major energy metabolisms (carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids), affect cellular energy supply. Furthermore, there is a close association between neuronal activity and energy metabolism. In the present study, the levels of pyruvic acid, citric acid, and fumaric acid in the M group were decreased compared to the NC group. That is to say, the blocked TCA cycle affected the energy supply to cells and neuronal damage may have been induced. After the administration of CAT, GE, GEN, GPA, AU, AJU, RC, and RD, there was an upward trend in metabolite levels in the treatment groups. The elevation of citric acid and fumaric acid in the AU, AJU, and RC groups were not significant compared to the M group, but all of the eight components had an apparent pullback effect on the pyruvate levels. Therefore, the eight iridoid components could improve energy metabolic disorders and exert neuroprotective effects by regulating the TCA cycle.Purine mainly exists in the form of nucleotides and participates in various cellular processes to maintain metabolic homeostasis. In purine metabolism, adenosine is deaminated under the action of adenosine deaminase to produce inosine, which is further converted to obtain hypoxanthine, which is then catalyzed by xanthine oxidase to produce xanthine, and the final metabolite uric acid. Thus, the process by which xanthine oxidase catalyzes hypoxanthine and xanthine could produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), resulting in increased oxidative stress. In this study, decreased levels of adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine were observed in the M group. It was speculated that the overactivity of xanthine oxidase would lead to the production of excess oxidative substances, resulting in increased oxidative damage and neuronal apoptosis. After the administration of CAT, GE, GEN, GPA, AU, AJU, RC, and RD, purine metabolite levels increased to different degrees, suggesting that the eight iridoid components play an important role in improving neuronal injury by restoring the dysregulation of purine metabolism and reducing the production of oxidative substances. Of these, GE and AU showed a lesser degree of improvement in terms of levels of purine metabolites.\\', \\'ref_196:The activity of UGT91P3 was tested in vitro using bacteria extracts and in vivo through transient expression in N. benthamiana. UGT91P3 was not active against crocetin, but when the activity of UGT91P3 was tested with UGT74AD1 over crocetin, it was possible to detect crocins with more than two glucose molecules, such as crocin-3Gg, crocin-4GG, together with crocin-2G, which was also detected in the reaction. In addition, UGT91P3 was incubated alone with crocin-3Gg, catalyzing the formation of crocin-4GG. The obtained products in the two different reactions suggest that crocin-1g, crocin-2gg and crocin-3Gg are substrates for UGT91P3. The activity of UGT91P3 was also tested in N. benthamiana leaves by transient expression, together with additional crocin pathway enzymes. It was previously described that the transient or stable expression of CsCCD2L in N. benthamiana plants allowed the accumulation of crocins, which are produced from crocetin by the action of endogenous UGTs. However, the co-expression of the specific UGTs in saffron allowed for greater efficiency in terms of crocin levels, and the production of new ones, which were not detected when CsCCD2L was expressed alone. The co-expression of UGT91P3 was associated with a higher accumulation of crocins with a higher glucosylation degree (more glucose molecules), proving the activity of this UGT in planta. Previously, other UGTs involved in the sugar chain elongation of crocins have been identified in gardenia and Buddleja; in both cases, the identified UGTs belonged to the UGT94 subfamily, although the identity between these enzymes was below 52%. Interestingly, UGT91P3 showed only 32–33% identity with these enzymes. These findings confirm that the recruitment of enzymes from different subfamilies in the pathway of crocin biosynthesis, such as the UGTs and the CCDs, points out the parallel evolution of this pathway in monocots (saffron) and dicots (Buddleja and gardenia). One of the important and most unique properties of UGTs is that they can form homo- and hetero-oligomers. Furthermore, it has long been established that successive enzymatic steps are often catalyzed by physically interacting proteins forming permanent or transient multi-enzyme complexes in the cellular environment, where intermediates are passed on from one enzyme to the next, referred to as metabolic channeling, leading to an optimized metabolic flux. In addition, it was found that these enzyme complexes are often associated with intra-cellular membrane systems. UGT74AD1 seems to be associated with membrane structures, and it was also detected in a proteome of chromoplast from saffron, suggesting an interaction with the external membrane of the chromoplast, where it easily accesses the crocetin substrate, synthesized in the chromoplast by CsCCD2L. In this context, two-hybrid (Y2H) assays were carried out to determine the presence of a UGT-based enzymatic complex taking part in the saffron crocin pathway. Notably, this analysis showed the interaction between UGT74AD1 and UGT91P3, thus suggesting the presence of a metabolon in the cellular environment, which could provide catalytic advantages via substrate channeling, preventing the loss of intermediates (Figure 1) by diffusion and by the reduction of the transit time between active sites, thus protecting the chemically labile intermediates, for the action of other enzymes (in this particular case, the presence of hydrolases in the stigma tissue).In conclusion, the results from the present study reveal a novel enzymatic activity in the specialized metabolic pathways of crocins in saffron, and allowed for completing the identification of candidate enzymes for all the steps in the biosynthesis of these valuable compounds. From a commercial point of view, the identification of UGT91P3 has important implications, since it provides an additional tool for the industrial exploitation of these apocarotenoids, enabling their higher stability, solubility and, potentially, bioavailability.\\', \\'ref_197:Previous studies have indicated that root extract of Inula helenium has inhibitory activity against various cancer cell lines. One recent study by Pal et al. has shown that Inula recemosa extract containing alantolactone and isoalantolactone induces apoptosis and increased ROS generation in HL-60 cells. However, the role of ROS remained undefined. In the present study, we addressed the question of whether or not isoalantolactone could induce apoptosis and increase ROS generation in PANC-1 cells. To address the question, we examined the antiproliferative, apoptotic and ROS generating ability of isoalantolactone using MTT assay and flow cytometry. The results showed that isoalantolactone inhibited growth of PANC-1 cells and induced apoptosis and ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner. To probe the possible role of ROS, we performed MTT assay, Live/dead assay and apoptosis assay in the presence of a specific ROS inhibitor, NAC. The results showed that pretreatment with NAC restored cell viability and blocked the apoptotic effect of isoalantolactone completely. The data demonstrate clearly that isoalantolactone exerts its growth inhibitory effect through ROS generation. The present study provides evidence for the first time that isoalantolactone induces ROS-dependent apoptosis in PANC-1 cells.Once cytochrome c is released to cytosol, it binds and activates caspase-9, which then results in the activation of other downstream caspases and ultimately caspase-3. Caspase-3 has been identified as a main executioner of apoptotic response inside the cells. Finally activated caspase-3 cleaved effector proteins including PARP, and induced DNA fragmentation in nucleus which eventually leads to cell death. In the present study, an increase in the cleaved caspase-3 has been observed in isoalantolactone-treated cells. These results demonstrate clearly that isoalantolactone induces apoptosis in PANC-1 cells through mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase-3 activation. It has been reported previously that increased intracellular ROS generation induces the cell cycle arrest at S phase. Our cell cycle analysis results clearly confirm these findings.A number of previous studies have shown that the phytochemicals targeting ROS metabolism can selectively kill the cancer cells by raising the level of ROS above a toxic threshold. As cancer cells contain higher level of basal endogenous ROS than normal cells, the toxic threshold value in cancer cells can be achieved faster compared to normal cells. In the present study, isoalantolactone showed strong growth inhibitory effect towards PANC-1 cells; however this growth inhibitory effect of isoalantolactone towards normal cells (COS-7) was significantly lower compared to the cancer cells. In addition, isoalantolactone did not cause any dectectable acute or chronic toxicity in liver and kidneys of CD1 mice in vivo at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight. This selective toxicity of isoalantolactone between cancer cells and normal cells may be due to much lower level of endogenous ROS in normal cells than cancer cells. However, a detailed investigation of this selective cytotoxicity of isoalantolactone still needs to be performed in vivo.\\', \\'ref_198:PA96 was synthesized from Prottremin using the original three-step stereoselective procedure. We found that PA96: (1) supported the survival of cultured näive dopamine neurons, (2) supported the survival of MPP+-challenged dopamine neurons in vitro and in vivo; (3) had chemically appropriate properties (synthesis, solubility, etc.), (4) alleviated motor deficits in MPTP- and haloperidol-based animal models of PD, (5) penetrated the blood–brain barrier in vivo, (6) was eliminated from the bloodstream relative rapidly. Similarly to the related compound, epoxydiol, PA96 supported the survival of cultured dopamine neurons in a dose-dependent manner. However, the potency of PA96 in this assay was significantly higher than that of the related compound: effective doses of epoxydiol were in the range of 0.1–1 µM while PA96 was effective already at 1 nM. Therefore, the potency of PA96 is up to 100 times higher than that of epoxydiol. Moreover, neither cytotoxic effect in naive neurons nor increased cytotoxicity with the administration of MPP+ were observed in in vitro experiments. The dose-response curve of PA96 was not linear: we observed the superior efficacy of a lower PA96 dose (1 nM) compared to a larger one (10 and 100 nM). It is a common phenomenon in pharmacology and can be caused by several factors, including (1) toxicity of the higher doses of the studied compounds, (2) saturation and/or degradation of receptors, and (3) activation of negative feedback mechanisms in the cells in order to maintain homeostasis. To date, the only known substances able to support neuronal survival are neurotrophic factors (NTFs). NTFs bind to extracellular receptors and activate intracellular cascades necessary for neuronal survival, maintenance, and functioning. However, experimental evidence indicates that excessive and/or long-term cell stimulation with NTFs will not increase the neuronal capacity to survive but more likely lead to detrimental effects. It is related to the activation of negative feedback mechanisms and/or depletion of the receptor pool on the cell surface, as discussed in detail in. Since PA96 also supports the survival of dopamine neurons, we assume that it also activates intracellular prosurvival cascades in the cells via specific yet-to-be-identified receptors. Thus, to explain this bell-shaped dose-response curve, we propose several hypotheses (1) PA96 may have off-target effects opposing their beneficial properties; (2) receptors activated by PA96 may become saturated, and therefore the response reaches a plateau or even decreases; and (3) negative feedback mechanisms might be activated in the cells. Obviously, further studies are needed to substantiate the underlying mechanisms.Next, to evaluate the biological activity of PA96 in vivo, we used the MPTP-based animal model of PD, which allowed us to monitor both behavioral changes and the status of the dopamine system in experimental animals. To address motor deficits, we used two different tests: an open field to assess free movement and coat hanger tests to assess forced movement and motor coordination. We observed significant movement alterations induced by MPTP in both tests (open field and coat hanger) 24 h after the fourth toxin injection. However, these changes were short living and were not observed 7- and 14-days post MPTP. Indeed, the MPTP model of PD in the format used in this study comes with several limitations: (1) rodent locomotion is controlled in a different manner than that of humans, thus making the interpretation of rodent behavior as Parkinsonian following dopaminergic lesions very challenging; (2) MPTP-treated mice shown a paucity of locomotion shortly after toxin administration, but these deficits disappeared over time, due to diminishing effects of the toxin on peripheral organs; and (3) lack of specific deficits in motor behavior is not associated with any substantial loss of substantia nigra neurons or degeneration of striatal dopaminergic fibers. Therefore, administration of PA96 (at a dose of 1 mg/kg) enhanced motor coordination in the coat hanger test and duration of activity in the open field test after 24 h, but not at the other studied time points. Altogether, these results show that PA96 in low doses improved overall motor deficits in MPTP-lesioned mice. The results of our histological study demonstrate that MPTP significantly decreased the number of dopamine neurons and axonal fibers of the nigrostriatal pathway. PA96 in low concentration supported the survival of dopaminergic neurons in vivo. However, it is unclear whether PA96 can stimulate the outgrowth and arborization of neurites of dopamine neurons in the striatum since their loss induced by MPTP in this experiment was not alleviated by PA96. It is worth mentioning that neurodegeneration in PD starts from axons, and their regrowth takes time. Therefore, PA96 promoted the survival of neuron cell bodies and might not have enough time for stimulation of neurites outgrowth. In addition, this data matched with those obtained for dopamine and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) concentrations in the midbrain and striatum. MPTP-treated mice significantly reduced the dopamine and DOPAC concentrations in the striatum and midbrain. At the same time, PA96 tended to increase dopamine and DOPAC levels in the midbrain but not in the striatum.\\', \\'ref_199:Cytochrome P450 CYP153 is an enzyme family known for the biocatalytic terminal hydroxylation of different types of molecules (Liang et al.). Functionalization of methyl groups under mild conditions is an attractive biotransformation since it is difficult to perform with green methodology and high selectivity using conventional synthetic methods (Nakamura and Nakada; Campbell and Stahl). Cytochrome P450 CYP153A6 from Mycobacterium sp. strain HXN-1500 was previously found as a selective system for the hydroxylation of methyl groups contained in linear and cyclic hydrocarbons, such as n-octane, (S)-limonene, and p-cymene (Pennec et al.; Cornelissen et al.). The entire operon of CYP153A6 consists of the monooxygenase and its electron partners (ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin) and their recombinant expression was achieved in different bacterial hosts (P. putida, E. coli); a noteworthy improvement of the biocatalyst activity was obtained by expressing the operon with a pET vector in E. coli (Gudiminchi et al.).Optimized whole cells of E. coli harboring the operon of monooxygenase CYP153A6 have been used for highly regioselective hydroxylation of different monoterpene derivatives. Hydroxylation predominantly occurred at the allylic methyl group attached to the ring, even in the presence of other allylic methyl groups, indicating a fine selectivity. Notably, this selectivity is complementary to the one normally observed with chemical reagents used for allylic hydroxylations (Nakamura and Nakada). Therefore, this research provides an alternative solution for the selective oxyfunctionalization of monoterpene derivatives, and more generally, paves the way to the modification of natural substrates into derivatives with higher hydrophilicity and lower volatility using a convenient microbial recombinant system.\\', \\'ref_200:It is important that the inducible systems do not interfere with each other, otherwise the impact on the system would be hard to deconvolute. In part, this property has been achieved using regulators that do not bind to each other’s molecules or DNA sequences. In yeast, there is the additional problem where it is difficult to block the transcription that occurs between neighboring cistrons. We overcome this problem by placing insulators between the genes so that each inducible system only impacts the expression of its assigned enzyme without having to spatially separate the loci across the genome. Previously, we developed a strain of E. coli that contains 12 inducible systems encoded in its genome, which we refer to as the “Marionette” strains because so many genes can be simultaneously controlled. Additional inducible systems were not added, in part, because we began to observe a growth burden that would affect its use to optimize systems. In yeast, there are additional regulatory proteins that are orthogonal to the four that we selected, but we began to observe a growth defect with larger numbers of inducible systems. In theory, it should be possible to put many more systems simultaneously in the yeast genome, but we need to better understand and mitigate the impact of carrying heterologous regulators. There has been promising recent work to apply biophysics and control theory to this problem and it may be possible in the future to expand the complexity of the systems carried in yeast.In this manuscript, we applied our system to a problem of metabolic optimization for linalool production and show how it can be used to identify the optimal expression levels and timing. Optimization requires only making a single strain containing the pathway and then growing cells in different combinations of inducer concentration. A relatively simple optimization required 32 strains, corresponding to ∼1 MB of DNA construction if we altered expression levels by changing the physical DNA parts assigned to each gene, which we have done previously in yeast and bacteria. Further, we used the system to quantify when different enzymes need to be induced, which could be used to guide the design of genetic circuits that turn on at the needed times without the addition of inducers. These data demonstrate the benefit of inducing all of the enzymes simultaneously with a slight delay to allow for growth to initiate before enzymes are expressed. We did not observe the need to stage more complex delays in gene expression that have been observed for other systems and “just-in-time” expression. However, this could be due to us only evaluating gene expression delays in large and discrete timesteps of 2–4 h. Automated strain construction is rapidly becoming the norm in the field. With advances in acoustic liquid handlers that enable the mixing of picoliter droplets, it may be possible to automate the generation of each round of combinatorial inducer testing. This advance would make it possible to rapidly iterate through as many variants as could be analytically evaluated, perhaps using the guidance of search algorithms in selecting new rounds of combinatorics to be tested. This possibility speaks to a future where strains are developed specifically to work with high-throughput automation platforms to enable rapid searches through the complexity of multiparameter genetic search spaces.\\']根据以上材料回答问题,回答中注明信息来源，问题是：关于I型TPS的晶体结构中，提到carbonyl的文献'"
